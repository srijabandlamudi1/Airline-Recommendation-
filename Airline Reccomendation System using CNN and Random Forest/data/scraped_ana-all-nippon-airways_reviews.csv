"""very courteous, polite and helpful""",9,Ronny Adriansyah,6th February 2021,"✅ Trip Verified | We flew ANA flight NH 12 from Tokyo Narita (NRT) to Chicago O'Hare (ORD) on January 13th 2021 as part of trip home to Houston after a SE Asia Family trip. We connected to NH 12 from another ANA flight so after passing security we go directly to our boarding gate. ANA requires all passengers to keep their mask on all the time while in the airplane and while transiting except when eating or drinking. Several ANA gate attendant were making rounds checking people's documents to ensure everybody can legally enter the US. This is better than the UA process of lining everybody up in just one line and clueless on what is the requirement for entry for different countries like we experienced in SFO on our outbound trip. Boarding was announced a few minutes early. Boarding was done in groups; Business Class passengers going first then they start loading Economy from back to the front. They called by rows so there is minimum line formed at the gate, and people can social distancing while lining up. The aircraft was a 14 years old B777-300ER (JA875A) but still in good condition. The flight was quite full but boarding was done quickly. Even with the announcements on cleanings already done on the aircraft cabin, we used Clorox wipes to clean tray tables, seatbelts, armrest and screen when we got to our seat. The seat has fixed back and pivots on the upper section and slides the seat cushion forward for reclining, so there is no risk of person in front of you reclining and intruding into your space. There is footrest under the seat in front of you. Entertainment was OK but for an 11 hour trip like this more choice of movies and TV programs will be appreciated. We used our 3.5"" jack wireless transmitter and bluetooth earphones to avoid cable tangles from the provided earphones. The FAs on this flight were relatively younger than the other ANA flights we flew last few times. They are very courteous, polite and helpful, and they are cheerful when they were doing their job and their positive attitude helps passengers to relax. Rice crackers and wet towelettes were handed out with the first drink service. Afterwards we were served dinner along with another drink cart service. Dinner was either beef sukiyaki or braised seafood. I opted for sukiyaki and it was really good. Later breakfast was served and the choices are salmon flake omelette or pancakes. I chose pancakes and the pancake was good, infused with lots of syrup along with a chicken sausage. Before we land we got a tomato cheese bread snack. we were properly fed during the trip compared to American airliners. In between meals the FAs going around offering water bottles or snacks every couple hours or so. They also set up a snack and drink basket that we can help ourselves at the back galley. There were two teams of FAs and I can see them all working hard and all were very cheerful and helpful to the passengers. They were all so good that I decided to give them a box of chocolate I got from Narita during our transit. They initially refused saying this is too much for them but I told them they deserve it for their good service and to share with the other Team, and they finally obliged. We had to wait for late transferring passengers so we were around 15 minutes behind schedule, but we caught up along the way and arrived at 1.13 pm, 37 minutes early to Chicago O'Hare's Terminal 5. Deplaning was done very orderly, they called by the rows to deplane so there is no line waiting to get off the plane.",Boeing 77W,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Tokyo Narita (NRT) to Chicago O'Hare (ORD),January 2021,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,4,yes
"""very polite and courteous""",9,Ronny Adriansyah,5th February 2021,"✅ Trip Verified |  Jakarta to Tokyo Narita on 13th January 2021 on the way home to Houston after a SE Asia trip. Checked in online and was able to secure bulkhead seats. Bag drop counter person worked very quick and professional, and put a priority tag on our luggage. Boarding was done in an orderly fashion, Business Class first, then Economy by row from back to front. The aircraft was a 5 year old B789 (JA875A). The seats were spacious, with footrest and leg rest, and a small tray for holding drink in between the seats, and an individual reading light. Aside from us, there is only one other person in the whole Premium Economy section. The aircraft is clean, but we still use the Clorox wipes to clean the tray table, seatbelts, armrest and the screen when we got to our seat. The tray table and screen in the bulkhead seat is folded into the seat and the touch screen is quite responsive. There is enough movies and TV series to occupy us for this 6.5 hours flight. We left 22 minutes late because we have to wait for some late passengers. But we arrived at 3:13 PM local time, a good 27 minutes ahead of schedule. FAs for this trip were very polite and courteous, and quite helpful and cheerful, a better crew set than the previous ANA flight from Tokyo 2 weeks before. We were given rice crackers, drinks and wet wipes after takeoff, then the breakfast cart start making their rounds. Choices are pancakes and white fish, and I chose the pancake. The pancake was fluffy and infused with syrup, and the accompanying chicken sausage and veggies are quite decent.

"""This is a good flight with ANA""",8,Ronny Adriansyah,5th February 2021,"✅ Trip Verified | Flew ANA Tokyo Narita - Jakarta on 31st December 2020 as part of a SE Asia Trip with family. We arrived from SFO on UA and ANA checked all transit passenger documents at their transfer counter before we are given a clearance to proceed to our respective gates. We had time to spare so we stayed at ANA Lounge prior to our departure. Boarding was very orderly and they called passengers by row starting from the back. Most of us have been seated 30 minutes before departure time but had to wait for transfer or late passengers so we were leaving around 15 minutes behind schedule. The plane was an 8 year old 788 (JA805A) but still very clean and in good condition. The seats cushion is fine and here is this net type footrest under the seat in front of you. The load is quite full (perhaps 70-80%) but the flight attendants were able to give out good service. Rice crackers snack, drinks and hand wipes were given after takeoff, and there were two other drink runs afterwards, one with supper and another one with the snack. In between the FAs went around every couple hours to offer bottled water. We got a very good supper (White fish or seafood in red sauce - I chose the seafood and it was good!) and after that a cheese tomato roll snack an hour or so before we arrived. A FA remembers when I asked for sake for dinner but she didn't have it in her cart, and she promptly return with the sake afterwards. However the crew doesn't seem to be the cheerful type. They are courteous and helpful but they are not as friendly as most ANA FAs I met in the past. As usual in a long flight I took a walk to the back of the plane and stretch in front of the restroom near the back galley, and afterwards returning to my seat through the other aisle. When I was passing the galley a FA was asking if I need anything and that I shouldn't be in the back galley area. Well I told her I was on my way back to my seat but since I'm here I'll take a cup of sake and some crackers if she don't mind. It surprises me since in most other long haul flights they always set up a snack basket and beverages in the galleys for people to take themselves and we can always cross the galley when we're walking around. This doesn't seem to be the case - or is it because of this particular route or crew, I don't know. Entertainment works well, and we used our 3.5"" jack wireless transmitter and bluetooth headphones to avoid the cable tangle. Movie selection is not too extensive but enough for this 7+ hours flight. We land in CGK at 11.26 pm or 29 minutes ahead of schedule, and deplaning was done quick and orderly. This is a good flight with ANA but I believe we may have a crew set who were not as enthusiastic or cheerful in providing service, or perhaps due to this flight being a night flight but not a redeye because they all looks kind of tired and reserved.",Boeing 788,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Tokyo Narita to Jakarta,December 2020,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4,yes

Although the seat in this flight was not that comfortable (the model is 767); the food & beverages could help you forgotten the uncomfortable feeling of the seats. The food is really amazing; hot enough, taste delicious, and the most important thing Is that after you have your dining finished; the flight attendants will serve you drink Every 15 mins with a different beverages each time; which I have never experienced on other airlines.

"""the best airline experience""",9,J Pardel,10th June 2020,"✅ Trip Verified |  Manila to Vancouver via Tokyo. As part Filipino and part Japanese, I’m proud to say that the presentation of the safety video is very nostalgic and very cultural, which is what I love! The effort, cleanliness, quality and excellent service of the Japanese food and care from the flight attendants is superior!  The food tastes freshly steamed and cooked with juicy flavors from the main dish, whereas the small side dishes tastes great, plus mini ice cream for dessert! Entertainment was great too. I even like how they even set up a warning about safety concerns for turbulence impact, reminding to wear your seatbelt and PA announcements on the mini TV screen. The cleanliness in the aircraft, the space and comfortably is superb! My only concern is the room space for the leg space for the economy class in the very back seat which is connected to the wall. Either way, the seat itself with the pillows and the blankets are pretty comfortable and clean!  I highly recommend to anyone to look into ANA, their honesty about operating during a pandemic crisis like at this time is strongly recommended to those who are struggling to return to their homes. I would like to say thank you so much again for your hard work and effort and for taking us home safely during this pandemic as it’s tough to work through this crisis.

Whilst the Australian governments changed their policy daily during this period, our flight remained with on ok status. We flew last night, despite having an extremely low number of passengers. Despite enduring obvious concerns regarding their industry and their personal careers, the flight staff were friendly, helpful and professional. My admiration and gratitude are overwhelming.

The seats in economy and premium economy had a foot paddle and the seat was comfortable and recline was good. The entertainment was pretty good with lots of new movies like Endgame, Spider-Man, Far from Home and Godzilla. The lounge in Tokyo Haneda welcomes business and Premium Economy passengers which lots of airlines don't do (and only welcome business class passengers) The food was good and the lounge staff were so polite.

However, I had a really good time chatting with one of the stewardess and she allowed me to stand and stretch my legs whilst waiting for my cup noodle.

We were told that we should buy another seat for infant to be safe. After checking further their website, I found that the weight restriction for infants in the bassinet is 10 kg. I asked them to refund the tickets, to which they told me I must pay a cancellation fee. I suggested they could refund the ticket with no fee as I booked the ticket only 30 minutes ago. They refused because I booked my ticket on the website I was automatically directed to. I decided to deal with this and hope all would be ok. Finally flight day arrived, and we had no baby bassinet and our seats had been moved from our reserved seats. The agent at the check-in counted was very accommodating and did their best to block a seat for us so that my baby could lay down which was appreciated. Onboard I found the bathrooms ill equipped, my food was average, my seat seemed small, entertainment weak, and supplies seemed lacking for food and childcare.

We felt the food provided was not as good as it could have been. The first meal is served within 2 hours of taking off. It was a passable chicken dish with side dishes of yoghurt, salad and ice cream. The second meal is a snack and is served within 2 hours of landing. Out of Australia, the snack was fine - something like a ham and cheese croissant, but out of Tokyo the snack was an open sandwich with an inexplicable ton of mayonnaise plus vegetables (corn?), I found it horrible. The entertainment options had some recent hollywood movies to choose from - not much choice apart from that. The TV shows and documentaries were poor or non existent.

My flight was exactly the day after ANA launched its new 777 configuration to JFK, so I got stuck with the old version. However, the cabin was sparkling clean and showed no need for upgrading. My complaint was mainly about obstructed view from the Cube, and lack of storage space providing the size of the suite. Lavatory was underwhelming for first class, especially when comparing to my experience on the new SQ Suites just a week earlier. Catering was excellent, as expected from ANA. I picked the Western menu with a lot of skepticism but then was surprised about how tasty the dishes were. The wagyu steak was indeed overcooked, as anticipated on board a flight, but it was, at the same time, tender, juicy, and flavorful.

The legroom in economy was one of the best we had ever experienced in economy. Recline could be better. (I'm 5""11 or 1.81m and I could stretch my legs out fully), seats were fairly comfortable and I had no problems sleeping 6-7 hours at a go on the 13hr flight and this is in economy. FA service was extremely hospitable. They served 2 meals and a snack over the course of 13 hours. The meals were great and as good as what some average Japanese restaurants would serve. It is also worth noting that the checked baggage arrived with no incident. The only minor gripe, perhaps, is that the 3-4-3 configuration in economy is quite a squeeze. But still, overall, it's hard to complain at such a price point. Even in economy it's such a good experience. They deserve to be consistently at the top of world rankings in all categories.

My scheduled return flight was on 10/12/2019, the day of Typhoon Hagibis. When Typhoon Hagibis was about to hit I got their notification by SMS that the return flight was canceled, but they didn't give further information of an alternative flight. I called my travel agent for help, they told me there is very little they can do on their side, and I have to call the ANA English call center for alternative flight arrangement. I called multiple times, but the line was busy, and finally the call was through, and I was directed to waiting for available service personnel. After 1 hour waiting my call was finally picked up , and arrange us into their 10/13 flight at the same departure time. In the next day afternoon, I got the notification again that my flight on 10/13 was canceled again.  I called the English call center again, multiple times, but I kept getting automatic Japanese audio reply which I don't understand, and couldn't get through to their service personnel.  Later, I found that their call center was down due to surged calls. Next day I went to Haneda airport when the transport services resumed, we were directed to ANA special service counters crowded with passengers. We were told the earliest flight we can took was on 10/18, that was all they were authorized to provide on the site. And we were offered the Eng call center no. which was expected to be available again in the night of 10/13, and asked us to call the center for other possibility. That is ridiculous to me, what is the point of setting up S-counters, and have customers to wait multiple hrs (>4 hrs for us), and then tell us to call a charged call center again for additional help?

"""poor ticketing system""",4,Syed Umar,4th October 2019,"✅ Trip Verified | Tokyo to Kuala Lumpur. Decent airline but poor ticketing and check-in system. Check-in at ANA counter always takes me more than 30mins because their system indicates that the name on the check-in system and name on passport is the other way around (First name, last name). This happens even though we strictly follow ANA'S online reservation system guideline on how to input names for people from various countries. I explained this to the ground staff at Narita and Haneda multiple times but their response is usually that the reservation system is handled by another department. Discrepancy between reservation system and check in system is definitely a possibility. I can't add my miles because ANA mile systems has a totally different rule for passengers without dedicated first name and last name.

Flying with ANA is always a pleasure as even before boarding the flight you know that the service will be of a very high standard due to Japanese custom of serving the client! Hence, it was no surprise that the flight has outstanding service from the Japanese and some Thai crew. Drinks and food was served in a superb manner, plane was very clean, toilets very super clean and if or whenever you called for service the crew came immediately, spoke with the most respect and promptly served you. This is a wonderful airline which I feel even Singapore Airlines and Cathy cannot match and they are great. However, what really impressed me was how professional the Purser in charge of my section; Ms Nagakawa was! I asked a Crew member for a customer form not realising that they would consider this as me being unhappy and raise it to their Purser. Ms Nagakawa came to me and said, ""Sir, you have asked for a customer form, could you give me an outline of what the problem is?"" The way in which she did it and showed concern made me realise what high standards this airline puts in pleasing a client and if the client is unhappy in anyway, they don't speak down to the client like other airlines do, their senior team members come professionally to appease the situation and help the client enjoy their flight. Luckily for her I had good news about how wonderful the flight was. She so politely spoke to me and appreciated it but that was not just it, she continued to maintain high standards by constantly checking on me and personally serving service of a high standard. An absolutely magnificent Purser who led the team by example and I had one of the best flights of my life. My return flight too was superb with high quality service from ANA.

In my distress, I turned to the first airport staff I met and they happened to be the ANA check-in supervisors. I had asked them on what I should do, whether I should check in first or try to retrieve my phone. Instead of providing me a textbook answer or redirecting me to the airport information desk, she offered for me to use her own mobile phone to call my family. I was shocked and deeply grateful. I had to make multiple calls on multiple phone numbers. But she remained She even continued to help me call my family as I checked in. They were patient, calm, and immensely helpful.

"""most disappointing""",1,L Lee,18th September 2019,"✅ Trip Verified | Taipei to Narita on 8/30 had a serious delay and the way ANA handling it was a mess. First of all, the ANA crew did not know anything about the problem or they knew but they did not tell us, there was no communication between the airline company and customers. All we can do was keep waiting for another delay announcement. A lot of people need to transfer at NRT so the staff let them change the tickets first, that I can totally understand. However, as a business class passenger, I should have the priority to change my flight to other Star Alliance member such as EVA Air, but there was no line for that and after 3 hours waiting in line, one of the staff said the system was closed and my flight cannot be changed. They should just tell us immediately so people did not have to wait for hours. ANA did not arrange a hotel for us, I was flying from JFK to TPE then transfer to NRT, the time I arrived at TPE was 4 am, the time I left TPE was 11 pm, 19 hours of waiting, it was a nightmare. I can assure you I am the passenger who waited for the longest hours. In this case, ANA obvious did not know when the plane can be fixed, they should just arrange a hotel for passengers instead of kept postponing boarding time without explanation.  ANA paid 15,000 yen for communication is barely enough, the taxi from the airport to my hotel was around 10,000 yen, with the tips and tax there’s not much left. At Taipei, food vouchers were not enough, foods were expensive at the airport. 200-300 Taiwanese dollars can’t even get a regular lunch set or dinner set. To sum up, this trip was a nightmare because of this incident. The most disappointing things were the way ANA deal with it.

This means that one parent and child sharing a seat can have a mask, along with the two other customers. The solution is to move the third customer in the row of 3 seats to another available seat, or separate the parents into two different rows of the plane.  To avoid confusion at check-in, and to save them the trouble of having to shuffle customers around at the last second, we offered to purchase a third seat today for our return flight.

As for our meals, we chose the hamburger salisbury with potatoes and it was delicious. It had 2 cold appetizers and both were excellent. One was like an imitation crab salad and the other an aspic with spinach. A french red or white along with a white sparkling wine were offered as well as sake. Our second meal was a tuna croissant with a yogurt and apple slices. The mini tuna croissant was also very tasty. We really enjoyed our flight on All Nippon from YVR to HND as the plane was so comfortable with great air quality and not too hot in the cabin. The seats were not all cramped together and perhaps it is because it is 3 3 3 across iso so many planes now at 3 4 3 across. We will never fly JAL ever again as it is so inferior compared to ANA.

On both flights (YVR-HND, HND-YVR), that sandwich in a box is the biggest disappointment. I would almost prefer it not be served at all.

ANA told all passengers before the flight that, due to potential turbulence, all lavatories on the phone could not be used. This is unreasonable. It turned out that there was almost no turbulence. Luckily, the flight attendant allowed me (and others) to use the lavatory. But it caused me psychological dismay. I did not eat any breakfast or drank anything offered to me because I was afraid that I might have to use the lavatory.

After some clarification they realized their mistake. The ANA Lounge in Haneda looks good, however there are only refreshments available and no snacks, therefore we had to go out and buy some food for our children. Boarding was another issue as they have 3 lines of Groups 1, 2 and 3 and although we were in Premier Class with Seats in Row 1 for all 5 of us we were directed to Group 2 boarding line.

I took the flight from China to Japan, which only took 2 hours and 10 mins. We delayed due to typhoon but I could see the effort that ANA group staff and cabin staff have put in to make their passengers happy and comfortable. One thing I would point out is that I could feel the difference between the tones of speech from those ANA staff and those airport staff. And that tone will initially make the first impression for passengers. On board the flight, I was warmly welcomed by the cabin crew. ANA’s cabin crew hold a very high standard service requirement and they conduct that to a very detailed and careful level. In general, the meal was one of the best I have had for this short flight and the seat was comfortable, too. The flight was very smooth as well and the flight crew kept the passengers updated quite well. The most outstanding detail I noticed about ANA crew was their cooperation during the flight. Very tiny details such as a smile, a please, a two-hand delivery, a small candy, and a poster card gift for children really made their service outstanding. If I would ask one more thing from ANA, it would probably be SMS flight status messages as they can be very beneficial for passengers especially for those with unexpected delays.

On the Boeing 777 the Business class seats are staggered and there is no one sitting side by side. There is not quite the same level of privacy as in First, but I found the seat quite uncomfortable. First of all, it is rather narrow and I found that I could not place my arms side by side. They had to be on the armrests, even when the seat was reclined, or made completely flat. For this reason, I was not able to do the latter and did not sleep well as a result. The seat was comfortable enough when reclined, but the screen is smaller than in First, and I was at the distance where wearing glasses made no different to the clarity of the film. The food was reasonably good and, since I was returning home, I chose the Japanese menu. However, I did not feel like sampling the meal offered just before landing.

ANA makes money providing this service so why can’t the US carriers. On the return trip from Tokyo to Washington DC I started to take a picture of the meager meal on the US carrier and was rudely snapped at by a stewardess that said I could not take pictures on the airplane.

However, I find the aircraft on the KUL-NRT route (Boeing 787) is better as the seat could be reclined as compared to the fixed-back shell design reclining system on NRT-JFK route (Boeing 777-300ER), where the lower back support and the seat itself were pushed forward when reclining.

After flying ANA, I may never fly any other airline for my long haul to the US. My flight with ANA was one of my best flight experiences in Economy on any carrier. I found the service to be superior, attentive but not intrusive - friendly, efficient and genuine. The food was scrumptious - go for the Japanese if you can - quite good! I also had a delicious chicken tandoori on the leg from Tokyo to KL. I don’t fly for the food but theirs was certinaly a plus. Enough snacks to manage the 14 hours from DC to Tokyo, plenty of water and juice served in the cabin throughout the flight and requests were responded to promptly efficiently and with sincerely kind service. Clean bathrooms for the whole flight. This really stood out. I actuallly watched an attendant clean the bathroom 3 or 4 times on the flight! And another insisted on cleaning it before I used it on another flight. How nice to have clean bathrooms for the whole flight! (Not often the case on other carriers on my long haul flights from SE Asia to DC). One note - make sure your flight from Tokyo to DC is operated by ANA (not United) as they are exceptional. Often the flights are code share with United, and the leg from Tokyo to DC is operated by United - which is only slightly better than taking a public bus in the sky.

Had read many glowing reviews and was very excited to fly with such well regarded airline. I was not disappointed. Their air hostesses take customer service to the next level, being professional and very polite. ANA fly a much more convenient route to Tokyo from Sydney than Japan Airlines, going to Haneda airport instead of Narita (Haneda is much closer to the city than Narita). ANA also fly quiet, more new aircraft (Boeing 787-9) than airlines like QANTAS which fly the same route and a similar time with much older aircraft (747). The 787 allows better air regulation in the cabin and can deal with turbulence quite well which helps with sleep in a red-eye flight. It was nice to have a flight where the food tasted really good. Was at restaurant quality which is surprising for airline food. IFE was pretty good, with a decent selection of new movies for all ages, including some of my favourite studio ghibli films. Seat was pretty comfortable with a good amount of leg room for someone who is almost 6 foot in height.

"""better even than other Asian carriers""",9,B Meadon,5th November 2017,"✅ Verified Review |  Los Angeles to Shanghai via Tokyo. This review is about the transpacific segments of a LAX-Shanghai trip I took on ANA aboard a 777-300ER. I rarely fly ANA because it is usually very far from being the cheapest carrier on any routing I take. On this occasion fare was within striking distance, so I decided to blow a few hundred extra dollars on them. It turned out to be a good choice. These people are light-years ahead of anyone else I've flown, especially US carriers, but in my opinion they do better even than other Asian carriers like Asiana and Singapore. The business class seat is truly excellent; spacious, comfortable, the dining table is brilliantly designed to give great space on which everything fits- the meal tray, the drinks, the phone, everything. But where they truly stand out is in their service. Their people are invariably polite, attentive, gracious, and pleasant. The only thing to criticize about the whole experience is the awful OnAir wifi, which is between slow and useless, on top of being expensive. Everything else is so top-notch that there is literally nothing to find fault with. The seat is so good, and the service is so well planned, that I barely felt the lack of connectivity. I read, and I slept, and got to China and back feeling like the long hours of travel (usually the part I like the least) were well spent. The whole experience, from check in to baggage retrieval, is thought through with convenience in mind. I can't afford to fly on them each time I go to Asia, but if your budget allows, or if their fare is not hugely above your next alternative, this carrier is really second to none and is well worth a few extra dollars for a stress-free and enjoyable transit.",Boeing 777-300ER,Business,Business Class,Los Angeles to Shanghai via Tokyo,November 2017,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,4,yes

However on the return the cabin staff  ignored me when I asked for water or tea. My partner was pestered to move seat forward by staff so that older folks behind us had enough leg space! I was so annoyed as I have paid for my seat and checked on to see if seats was moved back. I was approached by staff later asking me to put down the window shutter when the cabin lights were down. I felt that they were more concerned about Japanese passengers then non Japanese passengers. I didn't complain to air hostess at time as I wanted to just go home.

Sleep was no problem with the lie flat seat. The Japanese food selection was excellent. Lots of fish on tap. I didn't try the western menu. FA all slim, young and very attractive Japanese females. Did not see a male FA in our section. FA's very friendly and efficient. English not always 100% fluent but didn't matter. Adds to the overall experience.

PY to NRT and Business to KUL. Check in at IAD was surreal. I was waiting in line for the ANA counter to open and what a ceremony! The check in staff lines up in front of the check in desk, bowed and wished everyone a good morning in Japanese. Then they silently and graciously got on with their duties. The check-in staff were excellent but the ANA airport manager was really rude and unpleasant when I approached him to ask him a question about the wait for the wheelchair for my mother. That was the only bad experience of the journey. There were many apparent important looking Japanese people travelling on this flight and the ANA staff were bending over backwards to accommodate them at the expense (in my opinion) of other pax. PY passengers had access to the Lufthansa Business class lounge which was simply awful. Only cold food on offer. Boarding was done well and efficiently at IAD airport. Again, service on board was excellent but the food and IFE were disappointing. Mid flight from IAD to NRT, we were served a chicken sandwich which was essentially one slice of bread with a few strands of chicken and mayo. It was not accompanied with any chips or any other snacks which was disappointing for a flight of 13.5 hours. There were two main meals of small portions and again an odd combination of Western/Japanese items. NRT-KUL was in Business class due to the carrier changing the aircraft so we were upgraded to the 787 C class cabin which had a seating configuration of 2-2-2. The beds were angle type and not flat.

KUL-NRT on Y class due to absence of PY on this sector. Top marks for check in staff at KUL, boarding done well and I was travelling with a wheelchair pax and everything was faultless. Cabin attendants were superb, friendly and caring and fussed over my 83 year old mother who was travelling with me. Call bells were answered promptly and always politely. Each disabled pax was assigned a FA when deplaning to ensure that things ran smoothly. The downside, food and entertainment were sub par. They have a funny mixed menu where even if you order a Western meal, you get elements of Japanese food on your tray and vice versa. The IFE was lacking, especially on the long NRT-ORD flight. The Y seats were tight and narrow and would have been uncomfortable for any journey longer than the 7 hours that it took to get to NRT. From NRT-ORD, we had bulkhead window seats, in a 2-4-2 configuration in PY which was okay. There was a leg rest but the drawback was that the screen was mounted on the wall. There was a reasonable amount of recline, seats were wide but you could not stretch your feet out completely. That's okay as it was not designed to be business class. We were given noise cancelling headsets, slippers, ear plugs and other amenities.

Transfer in Tokyo was smooth and was also where I experienced first-hand how helpful ANA staff really are - I realised I did not have my passport about 5 minutes before the plane was to board, and the staff immediately leapt into action. Two began furiously calling on phones at the gate, and three left to go looking around at all the places I had been in the airport. They even told me that they would delay the flight until it was found! The passport was eventually handed in to the information desk at the airport and one of the staff then went to pick it up and delivered it to me. After this somewhat dramatic start to the second flight, the rest of the journey was smooth, The legroom was again impressive, and the seats were comfortable enough for me to catch a few hours of sleep.

Check in was easy and efficient. ANA allows premium economy passengers to have lounge access. The lounge was comfortable and was a good place to do some planespotting.  About 10 minutes before boarding, attendants came around making sure everyone knew the boarding time. Boarding was quick and easy and we pushed back really fast. Right after take-off, attendants came around with water and rice crackers. About 1 hour later, lunch service started. I ordered a beef and pork dish with cold soba, fruit, and a prosciutto wrap. Portions were very generous and were delicious. After dinner, attendants walked around giving vanilla Haagen Daz ice cream, which was delicious. Soon they dimmed the lights and allowed everyone to sleep. ANA allows premium economy passengers to have one extra dessert or cold soba noodles. I opted for a dessert, which was either a raspberry mouse or some mochi. I got the raspberry mouse, which was even better than the Haagen Daz. I tried to get some sleep, but I couldn't because I kept drinking green tea. Attendants constantly walked around and asked if we wanted water, and then they would give it to us. When the crew turned the lights back on, breakfast service started. I got some chicken with rice Shanghai-style with rice, yogurt, and fruit. This was equally as delicious. Attendants cleared our plates and begin the landing sequence. About an hour before landing, attendants handed out small candies with different flavors.

However, I would like to highlight the customer service from ANA thus far. On my return flight to KUL our of HND, they have changed the aircraft from a Boeing 787-9 to a Boeing 787-8. The latter plane does not have a premium economy class so ANA have upgraded us to Business class for the HND-KUL sector. To top it all, they apologised for the change in aircraft and assured us that if the aircraft was changed to yet a different aircraft with a premium economy cabin, we would still be flying Business class!

Always on time, always a quick flight, always a good experience except this time. The food is actually good and unique for airline food (if you can handle Japanese cuisine). They even add extra touches like an extra bag of snacks if you order an extra beer or wine mid flight. Planes immaculate. I have never in my life had a problem with any flight attendant. On the return from HND to GMP, I was sitting causally unbuckled with the cabin door open during boarding. An attendant came up to me, said welcome aboard and flat out asked me to my face if I wanted a seatbelt extender. Nothing about my posture, facial expression, or attitude remotely indicated I need help. I am 180 cm 120 kg (5'11"" 265 lb) and fly several times per year around Asia and to US and have never needed one. Never have I taken up others' seat space or anything. Nor have I ever really felt shame or lack of confidence being fat. But now I know that feeling. Unfortunate that she didn't know better. I emailed ANA upon return (didn't want to make a scene on board) as it really did ruin my flight.

"""staff still second to none""",7,D Wallis,2nd August 2017,"✅ Verified Review | I was looking forward to flying with ANA again from Phnom Penh to Chicago via Tokyo Narita, having flown them three years ago and, at that time, was completely overwhelmed with their product. The good news is that some things have not changed - namely their staff. Every ANA employee I encountered was warm, professional, and engaging. In fact, they averted a crisis when, upon getting off the plane in Tokyo, I discovered that I had left my toiletries on the plane. I contacted an ANA employee and within 10 minutes, I had my toiletries back. The flight attendants on all of my flights were top notch and were so kind and caring. Nothing was too much trouble for them. Where things fell short was at the ANA lounge at Narita. On the good side, the shower room was great! But the food at the lounge was very much lacking. I had a 9 hour layover at Narita and got to see the morning and afternoon offerings. While three years ago there was a noodle bar where they made your noodle dishes individually. That is now gone. For the AM, they had four hot dishes: onion soup, miso soup, scrambled eggs, and skillet potatoes. The scrambled eggs had a yellowish color that I had never seen before and looked very unappetizing. The potatoes were left out in the open on a chafing dish. You never knew how long they had been sitting there. In the afternoon, the same dishes were there except that the scrambled eggs were replaced by a noodle dish which, I must admit, was tasty! Again, the potatoes were left uncovered. Sadly, there were times when the noodle dish was left completely empty and not promptly replaced by the staff. The food on the plane, while good, was not awe-inspiring. I had both Japanese and Western dishes and none were remarkable. The only hot breakfast dish on the flight back to Chicago was an omelet. In fact, on all flights there were only three main courses available, two Western and one Japanese. It seems that the food selection on business class has gone down from three years ago. Would I fly ANA again? You bet! I just would lower my expectations on the food served.

One point of criticism: we didn't see any food until 90 mins out of Bombay and the hot course arrived only after 2 hours. Given that the flight departs BOM at dinnertime, this is unacceptable.

There is plenty of open space under each seat which allows you to either place a bag or stretch out if you are tall. The in-flight entertainment was also very up to date, and seeing the movie ""Your Name"" on the in-flight entertainment list was a good surprise. Other good parts of the plane itself are the blue lighting, automated shades, and the washrooms which were clean and not cramped. The use of mirrors inside the washroom really help to alleviate the cramped feeling. Food was well presented for Economy and definitely a step up from what you would expect from a typical North American airline. The selection of free snacks and drinks are much appreciated. Finally, the service was polite, friendly, and responsive. The only thing I can fault ANA for is that the in-flight wifi service was very slow. I paid $21.95 USD and it was barely able to load Instagram or even low-quality YouTube videos. I really hope to see free wifi or at least faster performance for paid wifi in the future.

I would point out the excellent service from crew of flight NH180 (Narita-Mexico) and NH179 (Mexico Juarez-Narita), especially during meal time. They gave me recommendation on which meal I should choose because I don't eat pork. They even realized that I was (probably) the only passenger who's neither Japanese nor Mexican.

"""HND connection is a winner""",8,S Heston,13th January 2017,"✅ Verified Review |  Haneda to New York JFK in late December 2016 with a return on January 4 in Business class. First, from a convenience stand point this flight cannot be beat. It is great to have a Haneda option to JFK available that avoids the 1.5 to 2hr transit from central Tokyo out to Narita where most US flights originate and land. I like ANA's seat configuration and the window seats with the side table on the aisle cannot be beat for privacy. You'll want to check the seat configuration on your specific flight as every other row alternates and other rows have seats where the side table is against the window. This second design exposes you more, but is also fine. Service is generally great, unobtrusive and responsive. Compared to JAL, the HND connection is a winner. Where ANA falls flat I think is food and the IFE system, for non-Japanese speakers. The selection is OK, but nothing great compared to Cathay where has a very large library available on demand. One thing I have noticed on Asian carriers is that the temperature is too high for most westerners. I find overly heated spaces claustrophobic. Dress in layers if you are heat sensitive. I have learned to carry a light cotton polo shirt in my carry on bag that I can slip on if necessary once on board. My complaint is the food. It is sometimes poor, especially the main meal, and this includes both the Japanese and International options. On the upside though is that the a la carte options that may be ordered at any time after the first meal are much better, especially the curry, salad, cheeses, fruit, ramen and other simple dishes. I think with the main meal they try too hard and fail. Overall ANA is head and shoulders above any US carrier, and I will continue to fly them regularly.",Boeing 777-300,Business,Business Class,HND to JFK,December 2016,5.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,4,yes

It was a world of difference transferring from United to ANA. Boarding was by row numbers and fairly organized and quick. The aircraft itself has an interesting 2x4x3 layout in Economy which I quite liked. Seat pitch was excellent at 34"" and I did also like that the seat slid forward instead of reclined back. The crew were lovely, welcoming and gracious. Meals and drinks were served efficiently and with a genuine friendliness. I chose the Japanese option for dinner and it was pretty good and substantial in quantity. The crew's command of English was fair I would say. IFE on a bright touchscreen that was responsive. The selection was decent for a 7 hour flight but probably too small for a longer transpacific. WIFI was spotty and dropped out from time to time. We departed about 30mins late and arrived 20mins behind schedule after midnight. My return flight with ANA was equally commendable. Comfortable, great meals, fantastic crew.

No FA at the plane door! We entered aircraft and seated without any welcome or support.

""" service from FAs consistently excellent""",8,N Kano,29th December 2016,"✅ Verified Review |  Have been flying on ANA either in economy or business three times a year for the last ten years between Honolulu and Narita. Whether in business or economy, inflight service from their FAs is consistently excellent. Food can be hit or miss but generally of high standards but not quite up to par with what is offered on mainland US flights. My only complaint is that with the Honolulu flight, upon arrival at Tokyo Narita, we are often parked away from the terminal and have to disembark by stairs and then get herded on to buses to be taken to the terminal. This has increasingly become the norm with the Honolulu to Tokyo Narita flight. On my latest flight, I complained to the FA about this as I have arthritis and it is difficult and painful for me to descend stairs with a carry on. She apologized for this and explained that ANA does not have control over gate assignments, but she did offer to assist me with my carry on.  I declined as I felt that it is not a FAs job to assist passengers with carrying their luggage.

ANA flies an up to date aircraft to New York with the configuration of business class that gives every passanger an isle access, a small table with storing facilities as well as a full flat bed with pillow and cover. The privacy is quite good above all if you choose a window seat with the table towards the aisle. The seat functionality is simple and the comfort pretty good even if the cushions are a bit hard. Food on board is good and the servings are just right so that you don't feel overly stuffed. Wine selections are good as well. On the downside the entertainment program which is extremely limited and not varied enough for non Asian costumers. The service onboard is very good in a japanese style. The flight attendants (almost always women) are very kind and attentive and tend to your every need.

No amenity kit was provided but there were slippers provided at every seat and the cabin crew came round with face masks, eye masks, ear plugs, hand and face cream which passengers were able to choose and pick off from a basket. In the toilets there was face moisturizer, good quality toothbrush and mouthwash in sachets. The service was impeccable. Compared with a business flight I took with a middle eastern airline 5 month back, I thought the cabin crew on this flight were more attentive and their presence was felt throughout the flight. There was one main meal served (breakfast) about one hour into the fight. There was a Japanese option and an international option to choose from. There was also an extensive list of options from soups, Ippudo ramen to chicken cutlet with rice on the ""anytime"" food list which most passengers chose from for the meal before landing.

"""we were pleased with the trip""",7,Monica Astrid,4th December 2016,"✅ Verified Review |  First time flying ANA, had high expectations based on reviews and reputation. Seats were comfy, cabin staff attitude mixed, some were very friendly, some not so much. On our outbound flight we left at 6 am from Jakarta, arrived in Narita past 3 pm. We were served a nice breakfast and around 11.30 am the cabin staff started giving out this small, round, soft bread with mayo and turkey ham. I asked her if that was the pre-lunch snack and to my surprise she said that was the lunch. Was really disappointed considering we'd land in Narita past lunch time, and since the only snack offered was little bags of rice crackers, albeit delicious, we'd be quite hungry. The return flight was at 6 pm, to reach Jakarta around midnight. Same thing, seats were nice, staff were mixed, departure and arrival on schedule. We were given options for dinner: eel or chicken. Didn't like eel so I chose chicken which I couldn't eat. Other than the food issue we were pleased with the trip. Check in process was smooth and fast. Departure and arrival on time.

One of the best things to enjoy in ANA business class is food, and of course the great selection of wines. As this is a midnight flight only a very light meal after take off and breakfast before landing are served. So don't expect full courses or appetizers as in other daylight flights. Seats for this business class are 1x2x1 and I would say that seats in A and K sides (windows) are the best in terms of privacy for passengers. Every seat has a very good space for personal items and as in other airlines seats are flat when they are totally reclined.

It wasn't even an issue when I was passing through the US immigration and there wasn't even warning about these dimension restriction when I got my tickets. I don't mind not hand carrying it but ANA staff had me check out from the immigration, go to the check in counter to check in my tripod, then go thru the immigration again. The airport was filled and badly ventilated. I didn't even get to enjoy my lounge experience, was drench in sweat and had to run to the gate as the gate was about to close. The staff could have just checked my tripod at my gate which would have saved me all the hassle from running thru the immigration checkpoints.

"""flight attendants were fantastic""",8,Wei Seng Woon,20th June 2016,"NH802 on 12 Jun 2016, served by a 77W (Boeing 777-300ER). As this was a codeshare flight with UA, and my ticket was under UA, I had to check-in under ANA since this was the first leg of my journey, even though subsequent legs of my journey were under UA. However I was unable to do online check-in, and after a call to the ANA call centre they said their system to process check-in for codeshare flights was down. Eventually had to check-in at the airport, and was allocated a middle seat as there were no window or aisle seats left. Didn't seem like a good start to the journey, though so far interface with customer-facing staff (whether call centre or check-in counter) were positive. On board, the middle seat in the middle row on the 77W actually turned out to be perfectly fine, as there was additional space between the two middle seats. This provided more room than the usual middle seat. The in-flight entertainment worked fine and was decent, but could have a wider variety of offerings. The seat-back was fixed, so when you recline your seat bottom moves out instead. Not very comfortable when you ""recline"", but I was not looking to sleep so I was not too bothered. The food was good (I had the Japanese meal - why not, since I'm flying a Japanese airline), and the service by the flight attendants were fantastic (always with a smile, very polite, and intuitive). I was particularly amused when I was taking photos out of the window on the cabin door in-flight, and a flight attendant offered to take a photo ""of"" me - she actually meant to help me to take a photo of myself, as she thought I might be interested to take a photo. I appreciated her initiative in anticipating customer's needs, despite the initial misunderstanding. Towards the end of the flight, candy was served, together with postcards for those who love memorabilia. Overall, the food and service were the stars of the show.

Staff and crew on this flight are very nice and professional and there is at least 1 or 2 FA's who speak very good English. At Narita and Hong Kong, both flights usually use gates at the far end of the terminals so best to make sure not to be late otherwise you will need to hurry to make the flight. Meal is served on a single tray at one time unlike appetizer, main course then dessert individually like on other ANA flights Regarding WiFi availability, I have not used it and not sure if is available on this flight.

We left in December and were fairly impressed with the evening flight to Haneda. However, there was no business class dessert. It was only a 21:30 departure. The IFE was good, the live broadcast of NHK was unavailable in some areas, screen was a great size and the noise cancelling headphones in Premium Economy were fantastic. We were expecting much the same on our return last week. The flight left Haneda just after 22:00, and relatively soon into the flight, the trolley came up the aisle. Assuming it was just pre-dinner drinks, I was ready to put in my request, but everyone was being given sandwiches, with a drink of their choice. I have flown other airlines at night and been served a meal, not just sandwiches.  I was able to request a cup of noodles, but that was pretty much it. The hot meal of the flight was the breakfast, an omelette. So on this leg, there were neither offers of champagne and business class wines or business class dessert. On both sectors, the cabin crew seemed to make themselves relatively scarce. I don't know how many other airlines allow their Premium Economy passengers access to the Lounge, but it would seem that ANA want their Premium Economy passengers to fill up in the lounge, rather than serve meals inflight. In retrospect, ANA perhaps believe that for heatlth reasons a light meal is better after 2200 in the evening, but I would rather a choice be offered than to have a decision made by the airline. The benefits I can see in flying Premium Economy with ANA is that you have lounge access with free food and beverages, the IFE has a larger screen.

The airplane was large, we had room for our legs, the food was surprisingly great! They even distribute Haggen Daaz Ice cream for dessert. I have read that the meal portion on ANA flights were small, so we bought more food at the airport, but it wasn't necessary. They distributed food and snacks during the whole 13 hours flight.

"""with excellent ANA service""",9,Phil Roberts,15th November 2015,"This new ANA daily direct service from Brussels to Tokyo Narita in Premium Economy was very good in both directions. The 38 inch seat pitch and 21 seat separate Premium Economy cabin was great and defintely worth paying extra for. The economy section in the rear appeared cramped and claustrophobic. ANA service in premium economy was professional and attentive although the meals (apart from the business class dessert - Haagen Daz ice cream!) are the same as in economy. Whilst the meals (choice of Japanese or Western) were not great drinks and snacks are available free throughout the whole flight. ANA staff at check in both Brussels and Tokyo were courteous, efficient and professional - something other airlines should take note of. If I had any criticism, the three toilets in the rear of the 787 for the whole of the economy section seemed a bit inadequate but the crew kept them perfectly clean and serviceable so no great concern overall. The fact that half the plane is taken by business seats also means there is not alot of room in the rear of the 787 to walk around. However overall a great product with excellent ANA service and a flight time of 11.5 hours between Brussels and Tokyo - recommended.",Boeing 787,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,BRU to NRT,November 2015,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4,yes

"""cabin crew was excellent""",8,C Witt,4th October 2015,"ANA from Washington to Tokyo Narita in Business Class on Boeing 777. Check-in a breeze and efficient staff ensured everything went smoothly. The pre-coordinated wheelchair assistance was readily available. Security was hassle free and no waiting. ANA lounge service is provided by Lufthansa on Concourse B near Gate 50 5 minutes from of departure Gate B41. Lufthansa, in consideration of my wife in a wheel chair, sat us in the Upper Lounge (First Class passengers). Thank you Lufthansa! The lounge atmosphere is bland and uninviting. Not a cozy place to kick back for any period of time and bright sunlight invades the entire lounge. The bill of fare is below United Clubs. Boarding was somewhat hectic but moved quickly once it commenced. Business class was not full. ANA seats business 4 across, in a staggered figuration one on each bulkhead and two in the center. Everyone has aisle access without disturbing his or her seat neighbor. In-flight entertainment was average and offered normal selections. There is a handy power outlet for charging your devices. The seat configuration is excellent with on the deck storage for small items. The tray pullout is world class and I haven’t experienced anything near as useful on any other airline. Seat controls are located on the side and were difficult to operate. I did not find the seat comfortable and the key element missing was the ability to raise my feet and legs, ie. recline. The seat was roomy and I found the seat tracking (forward/reverse) helpful. The cabin was hot for those on the sun side of the aircraft as there is no overhead air outlet.  A free 15 minutes period of wi-fi was provided with additional time available at a reasonable cost. The food was mediocre with small portions. Desert was disappointing and snacks almost non-existing. The cabin crew was excellent and always presented a pleasant demeanor which made the flight all that more enjoyable. Take note also that fellow passengers were dressed either in suit or business casual. No bare feet, legs or other level of undress usually found on American airlines were visible. Fellow passengers were quiet and considerate of their neighbors.

Fare and flight times were very good, check-in and boarding smooth. We reserved seats in advance without any fee. Throughout the trip we were treated with Japanese kindness, the FA's were very friendly and helpful. Only English language skills of the crew could be improved, sometimes they were difficult to understand. Seats in the Boeing 777-300ER were comfortable with generous seat pitch. But the fixed seats do not recline, they only move forward, so it was difficult to sleep. Meal choices are a bit limited, you've the choice between a Japanese meal and an international meal. If you don't like Japanese food, you have only one option. But quality, taste and quantity of the meals were good (lunch was okay, breakfast was superb). Entertainment was ok, ANA has a huge selection of movies, TV series and music, but most choices were not interesting for me.

A Boeing 777-300ER and the seats are in 3x3x3 layout in economy to Tokyo and surprisingly enough 2x4x3 in the flight from Tokyo to Singapore. Seat pitch is good and better than Singapore Airlines or United, but the width is a tad small. Reclining is acceptable too. Headrest, footrest are standard. Crew is very courteous and I had no issues communicating in English. Flight was delayed at LAX by 1 hour but managed to land on time in Tokyo and Singapore. Food is served hot and the service is pretty fast and meet my needs. As a vegetarian, I requested AVML and was surprised with the quality of food. Full marks here. Entertainment is mostly Hollywood + Japanese and perhaps this is an area they can improve in these days. The movies are not bad either - a dozen plus english movies, couple of Chinese, Indian, French and loads of japanese movies. Overall happy with the journey and I am flying with them next month. Excellent service, quick and attentive crew, on time, great food, In seat power and USB, Excellent/Clean toilets. No ear blasting announcements.

ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,10,G Treano,24th August 2015,"Chicago to Tokyo Narita, bought tickets five months out, and dirt cheap. Checked in on time. Staff friendly. Had a gift for my Mother-In law, and ground staff put a protective cover over it. The bad part of the trip was the United Airlines lounge at Chicago O'Hare. I don't know how United is in the Star Alliance. Alcohol was not free, bowls were styrofoam, with meager food selections, and non working WI-FI. I left the horrific, and dreary lounge early. Boarding was easy, however there was a long line. Boarded nicely, and accidentally went the wrong way. A nice cabin staff corrected me, and escorted me to my seat. Upon settling in, another cabin staff  introduced herself, saying she would be taking care of my section during the flight. Very polite, and professional. Immigration cards were distributed.  I had the the Japanese lunch which was very good. Champagne offered, along with a Chilean wine which I continued to enjoy throughout the flight. Dessert included multiple selections, including Dorayaki with Mocha. It was really good. Cabin staff  made continuous rounds throughout the flight, and never became ghosts. Cabin staff offered to make my bed.  Dining on demand was perfect, as I ordered soup. Watched another movie, and ordered the cheese platter, and Kutsudon, but still could not sleep. I was very comfortable however. Enjoyed the 2nd meal. That is getting kind of old, and ANA needs to do something about that. At least an alternate meal choice, like Singapore Airlines does. Landed 17 minutes ahead of schedule, however an Air China flight had tied up Immigration. Two pieces of Luggage came out reasonably quick, and a speedy trip through customs. I feel bad for ANA's passenger's flying out of ORD, because they do not get the full experience, due to the United Airlines lounge at Chicago O'Hare.",Boeing 777-300ER,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Chicago to Tokyo Narita,July 2015,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5,yes

ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,10,Keith Murray,22nd July 2015,"Best airline service I have ever had. Ever. Wonderful first-class checkin and exclusive security line at Narita. Smart attractive and efficient cabin crew, constant use of customer names (they memorized them from manifest before we boarded), well-maintained cabins, and delicious, plentiful food. High-end spirits and wines, including two choices for champagne, one of which was Krug. Quite simply, it was eleven hours of air travel the way it should be. As one example of the personal service I received, a FA noticed me yawn briefly after dinner and drinks, and in a heartbeat she was at my seat asking if I wanted her to make it into a bed. I told her not right now, thanks, and she said fine – but then when I wasn't looking she came up and made the seat across the aisle (first class wasn't full) into a bed. and a few minutes after that she came by and said there's your bed when you need it. So I went across and used it, put a blanket over me and the seatbelt over that, and went to sleep. I vaguely remember gentle touching while dozing. Come to find out later, when I was asleep she came by, thought the blanket wasn't classy enough and tucked me in with a duvet on top of that.  If I had to pick any nits, it would be the first-class 'suite' ground lounge in Tokyo. No real problems, nice enough food (plus Lindt chocolates which can help everything!), but it didn't match up with Qantas SYD, Cathay Pacific HKG or Lufthansa FRA. And onboard, the the wifi service was usage-based, way overpriced, slow and not user friendly when one reached the quota. I am told, however, that as soon as this month ANA is moving from the usage to a time-based system. Finally, as nice as the ""square suites"" are, in a window suite the wall of the square interferes with a good view. But truly, those are nits.

The only drawback I found was the noisy airplane: if you are used to travel on a Dreamliner or an A380 or A340 you will find the 777 extremely noisy (even with the noise cancellation headphones).

ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,7,D Skees,31st May 2015,"Friendly service - I checked in only an hour before departure and the check-in lady gave me a bulkhead seat for legroom. I also fell asleep during meal service but the stewardess came by when I woke up and offered me the meal. They were endlessly smiling when serving too. Aircraft was new 787 and I did feel less dry through the flight as they say - not too thirsty. Food was 2 meals dinner and breakfast - quality only OK but quite plentiful - miso soup main meat and veg plus noodles then fruit salad. They also brought round a hot flannel when waking before breakfast which was great. Entertainment was ok - around 30 films slightly clunky and old AFE around 8"" capacitive touchscreen. Enough choice for the flight. Also USB and laptop power.",,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,3,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,6,S Bajumi,27th May 2015,New revised economy's seating arrangement on ANA's 777-300 ER was a big disappointment. Flew on NH 0007 on May 18 continued on NH 835 on 787 on May 19 after 2.45 transit time. The first flight SFO-NRT was a miserable 10+ hours flight. I didn't expect to see 3x4x3 on a 77W seat plan especially from a 5 star airlines. Food was great and cabin crew were attentive but couldn't make up for the awkward seating arrangement. The second flight was on a 787 with a generous 2+4+2 it was a much better flight and I hope ANA will keep the seating arrangement on a 7+ hrs flight.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,2,no
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,9,H Michael,27th May 2015,"Just completed GMP-HND-GMP for the long Buddha's Birthday holiday in Korea. Despite many negative reviews of 787 seat space I was pleasantly surprised with the amount of legroom I had at 5'11"" and 250 lbs (180 cm 115 kg). I had enough space between my knees and the seat and could extend my legs full under the seat in front of me. I had both middle and window seats. The cabin felt spacious with its large windows and overhead bin design that created the feeling of high ceilings. The automatic ""no shade"" window shade buttons were very effective with 9am clear sunny skies. The AVOD was new and well designed and had a large selection of movies but the flight was short so there wasn't time to finish anything. ANA boards lightning fast. Our flight from HND-GMP boarded 15 minutes late but we still pushed back on time! Airplane food normally receives nothing but bad reviews but I was quite pleased with the meal service (under two hour flight so it was all on one tray). The vegetables fish and noodles all tasted fresh and were well arranged. The snack mix is the best. Crispy salty and crunchy! They also had unique drink offerings - Kabosu juice (sweet and tart) as well as their own black tea.",,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,10,K Baker,25th May 2015,JFK / NRT (First Class) NRT / JFK (Business Class) - The service provided on both sectors was seamless. I opted for western meal outbound and Japanese meal inbound. No complaints with food or beverages (Krug champagne in First only). The seats in both classes appeared similarly comfortable. ANA deserves their 5 star rating as service is top notch. Skip the lounge in JFK as nothing worthwhile but Narita lounge quite nice and beautiful airport views. Luggage appears immediately at both airports.,,,First Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5,yes

I flew round-trip from San Jose to New Delhi and this was by far the worst experience. The seats are so uncomfortable that 9 hour feels like forever. The quality and quantity of meal is below standard. I had a funny incident where flight crew offered me Ice cream and immediately took is back saying ""sorry this ice cream is not part of your special meal"". The IFE was a joke.

Drinks options are satisfactory. Lots of turbulence during the flight but pilots made no announcements on the weather. Crew were always smiling and made rounds to keep the passengers comfortable.

ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,7,W Simpson,10th April 2015,"BKK-HND on 787 cabin typically sterile in the interior design style that is an ""art form"" in Japan. Cabin service was abysmally slow - 1 hour and 40 minutes for drink and meal service to begin. No explanation given as to why there was a delay. Once completed the cabin service area became a hub for Duty Free dispensation for the remainder of the flight with staff arriving and departing from all directions through the Business Class cabin to take orders and deliver goods all of this at the expense of the well-being of Business Class passengers. Return flight HND to BKK on 787 was much better organised than the outbound catering-wise and there seemed to be none of the Duty Free bonanza sale to disturb the Business Class cabin. Overall rather disappointing for the reasons given and the lack of effective response to the issues raised.

ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,7,Charles Green,18th March 2015,In all respects bar one my experience of flying with ANA was a perfectly adequate one. Both flights were taken in Business Class. The first was from Dusseldorf to Toyko Narita on a 787. The second was from Tokyo Haneda to London. In terms of cabin ambience seating and IFE both flights were fine. The ANA business class cabin interior feels a little sterile but the seats are comfortable with plenty of personal space and a decent sized IFE screen. The selection of IFE programming could have been more extensive but it was sufficient. Noise cancelling headphones were supplied on both flights. The amenity kit was also fine but didn't stand out. Cabin service was efficient but lacked finesse or genuine attention to detail. Serviceable is the best way I could describe it. The main issue however was the food. With both a Japanese and 'International' menu offered you might expect the latter to actually cater to an international clientele and on the outbound leg from Dusseldorf to Tokyo it did with an accessible selection of options appealing to a wide variety of tastes. However on the return journey departing from Haneda the ANA 'Connoiseurs' international menu was provided (along with the standard Japanese option). This offered an unappetising 'amuse bouche' involving bamboo shoots in apsic and herrings followed by an equally unappetising soyabean milk bavarois with sea urchin jellied asparagus and smoked scallops (all cold) with no other options available. Only the main course a combination of hamburger patty small piece of beef and egg plant in an unidentifiable sauce was even vaguely appealing. Unless you wanted 'tilefish' or a pasta option that sounded even less pleasant. I have no problem with airlines trying to make their food more interesting but when you have a captive audience stuck on-board for 12 hours trying to push the envelope with left-field combinations like soyabean milk bavarois and sea urchin is taking things too far. Especially when it is the only option. It might be something that would appeal to an adventurous diner in an expensive restaurant but not a tired hungry passenger on board a long flight where the food is being prepared in a small galley from pre- prepared ingredients. 30000 feet in the air is not the place for culinary experimentation. Add to that the fact that options for the second meal during what is a long flight were uninspiring to say the least (although more appetising and less avant garde) and for the first time in a long time I actually regretted not eating a proper meal before I boarded my flight. After 12 hours on board I arrived at my destination feeling pretty hungry. Was it enough to put me off flying ANA again. No but next time I will check the in-flight menu before departure and may stock up on snack food before I fly.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,,4,yes

I must say I experience much better service with ANA compared to Singapore Airlines and Cathay Pacific. All legs of route services were immaculate. The only qualms I had is the 787 seats which is extremely uncomfortable for a 6-7 hours route flight. It makes it uncomfortable to sleep especially when you choose a red-eye flight.

ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,8,Tercon Bojan,19th January 2015,The thing about ANA is they have a lot of old planes like this 767-300 that I'm flying today from Shanghai to Tokyo. However the planes are always very well maintained so that you end up feeling like you’re flying in a meticulously recrafted retro cabin. A timepiece! Which kind of has a charm of its own. On this 2:20 min flight they offered an International or Japanese cuisine for the meal. We love Japanese food so we ordered the Japanese meal. However the flight attendant proceeds to tell us that they have no Japanese meals. Business class was nearly empty. We were the first to be asked. Japanese airline no Japanese meal. Anyhow she did eventually find us two meals. I think the pilots were left with no food! They do have extremely polite service though.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,4,yes

Fortunately my UA flight was on time immigration luggage delivery and customs very fast so NH kindly anticipated my flight to ITM for the 5.10pm one w/o fine.

ANA Lounge had good food and drink but it's a windowless set of rooms - too bad you can't see the tarmac. Showers were excellent as I was connecting from an overnight flight from Bangkok so it was refreshing. Boarding was on-time with the friendly bow from the gate agents. Welcomed on-board and attended to by a multitude of gracious attendants. Departed on time for 11 hour flight. Meals were good but menu confusing as it had listed 4 meals yet only 2 were served. Went with a mix of western and Japanese meal options and both were tasty - steak cooked well and pork noodles delicious. Small mattress and nice blanket provided for sleep - but the cabin temperature was insanely high. Both myself and my travel companion were sweating trying to sleep. That was the only complaint from this flight and would deter me from using ANA in the future. Seems like many Asian airlines are now keeping the heat on compared to airlines in the Americas. In-flight entertainment was ok - not a great selection which took away from the experience. Arrival was on-time and quick luggage retrieval.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,4,yes

ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,6,Dizon Marie,12th November 2014,Flew business class MNL-NRT-LAX and back. Food was better the last time I flew with them (2 years ago). Service a hit or miss - sometimes you get a friendly FA sometimes you come across a robot-like one. On my return trip I checked in 2 pieces of luggage one weighing 23kg and the other 33kg. The lady at the check in counter said I needed to pay 200usd for the overweight baggage and I was horrified. I said but my other bag is just 23kg! Then I should just transfer 1kg of my heavy bag to the lighter one. I was in disbelief! I felt like I was flying economy for the treatment I was getting.

ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,10,Peter Marsina,6th November 2014,JFK-NRT new first class seat. The suite was spacious bed comfortable. The only drawback is that you can’t really see out of the window unless you lean forward. The service was superb. The two flight attendants working the F cabin were both just wonderful and so helpful. There was no request I could not make. My glass of Krug was always full and caviar was replenished as soon as I finished it. I opted for the Japanese menu and the food was exquisite (getting caviar or dessert from the western menu was not a problem at all). The TV screen was big and IFE options were great watched a few movies before dozing off. I loved the Rimowa amenity kits they are well built and actually can be reused. I’ll give the skincare seems nice. The bathrooms were small for F cabin but at least there were two of them. They were cleaned after every use so spotless and pleasant to use or change in. Also the PJs are not so luxurious (but comfy enough) they make up for it by distributing cardigans as well. Overall this was an excellent flying/dining experience I would recommend ANA to anyone. It’s hard to beat this kind of service it’s just that good.,,,First Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,6,D Tise,5th November 2014,"I can say nothing beyond the miserable seats. The seat backs don't recline at all. The seat itself moves forward. That may be fine if your 5'5"" or so but at 6'3"" it's a disaster. My knees are already touching the seat back in front so when seat moves forward to recline what are you supposed to do with your legs. Unbelievably poor design.

They were extremely helpful while flying with a fussy and tired 1 year old. They went above and beyond and the crew genuinely enjoyed coming over to play with and entertain my daughter. They also served her a baby meal - a huge plus. Moreover once we landed in NRT there was some miscommunication about picking up our stroller at the door of the plane. The crew ensured that we got our stroller in a timely manner and provided us with an alternative stroller to get the baggage claim to pick up our stroller where it had ended up.

ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,5,Perrin Michel,5th October 2014,Kobe-Haneda. My flight departed at 7.05am. ANA specified 1 hr check-in time for luggage deposit. Therefore I had to take a taxi at 5.30am from Kobe Chuo-ko. I arrived at 5.50am. The airport doors were simply closed. Kobe airport physically opens at 6.00 i.e. 5 Minutes before last check-in (with luggage) official time. Indeed due to this fact they extended it to 6.30. They could have advised passengers.

ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,9,Zachary Ho,24th September 2014,SIN to HND HND to HKD. Staff were extremely courteous and friendly in assisting needs of passengers and always had a smile. The food was good and in adequate portions although drink runs were not frequent and you had to wait a while as there was only 1 cart serving the whole of economy section per aisle. Although they do walk around with a bottle of water. Snacks were given out in generous quantities package in a lovely bag. On all flights seats and legroom were comfortable. The negatives are probably the seat which cannot be recline and the movies which are limited and repetitive in other languages. The domestic flight had no entertainment but a live feed showing the take off and landing which was quite a change.

ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,9,C Shi,6th September 2014,"Flew LAX-NRT-PVG and back in June and July 2014. All in all a very satisfying experience. Every single flight except PVG-NRT arrived early and the 30 min delay on NH 922 was apologized excessively (due to ATC in China not their fault). Upon boarding one finds the plane in immaculate condition and FAs cordially welcoming passengers. The long haul 777-300ERs are configured as 2-4-3 which provides flexible seating for most groups. Seats provide generous 34"" legroom although the slide forward recline makes sleeping difficult. The entire design is very innovative complete with footrests double cup holders USB port power outlets and a huge AVOD screen. On the way back the standard IOJ configuration was swapped for a high density 777 with 3-4-3 seating on NRT-LAX. Honestly the seat did not seem any smaller (this was from directly after taking a 777-200 with 3-3-3 regional seating) but aisles and armrests were significantly narrower. Now onto the soft product. ANA flight attendants are extremely polite always smiling and hardworking making hourly drink runs even through sleeping period. However one FA on the return leg was significantly more senior and was an exception to the otherwise great customer service. Food is also top notch even in economy. You can tell they take great care in catering fresh ingredients. Plus it is served with metal cutlery and a cup of Haagan Dazs ice cream afterwards on long haul flights. The meal on NRT-PVG-NRT sectors in economy were seriously better than domestic first meals! In the past I usually use United for transpacific flights and have accrued enough miles to book this trip on Star Alliance partner ANA. The difference is as clear as day and night. I would highly recommend ANA for future trips between US and Asia.",,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes

Service on board was efficient friendly and warm. This is perhaps ANA's strong suit although it may just be a cultural thing for Japan but the cabin crew were beyond amazing. Every service call was answered and every request was honored. Their professionalism is excellent and each interaction was followed by a bow and a thank you even though they are the one doing you a favor. However the IFE seat comfort and food was average. 77W was configured as 3x4x3 however legroom was still excellent. IFE was disappointing and the choices of movies were just poor. However the moving map was of high quality. NRT-MNL leg on an older 767 but the seats were still comfortable and service was once again excellent. Overall. a very pleasant experience with ANA.

ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,6,T Ugasucia,26th August 2014,This review is for an economy class NRT-JFK trip. First off I would recommend ANA when flying to the US because overall the inflight experience is excellent thanks to the fabulous cabin crew. So much better than dealing with any of the US carriers and their surly service. However my numerous experiences with the ground staff at Narita airport makes me absolutely dread the return leg of my trip between NY and TYO. The check-in process is so confusing and takes so long. All the agents seem to be either new or have no concept of processing passengers quickly. It always takes 20 minutes from the time I reach the counter to when I leave it. Despite being polite and smiling the agents don't really give good advice and are not very helpful to be quite honest. If it weren't for the great cabin crew I'd rate the staff service as very poor. Inflight the economy class seats on the B777-300 are uncomfortable because of the head rest that juts out pushes my head forward so I'm sitting with my chin on my neck. I noticed a lot of passengers sleeping with their heads resting on the tray tables probably because of this. The economy class meals are just horrible. I have learned to buy or pack my own. The drink selections are good. The inflight entertainment is mediocre especially their music selection.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,,3,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,10,R Nirschel,18th August 2014,I had a very good trip with ANA (Tokyo to Saigon and return to the US) in Feb and May. Because of a death in the family I had to alter my return trip and (although the waiting time on the phone was longish) the response was warm understanding and accommodating for my change in plans. The negative about ANA is that it codeshares with United (a terrible airline) out of New York so the long leg from NY to Tokyo is suffered with bad food costly drinks and lousy service. It was paradise to change to an all ANA crew and flight in Tokyo. We are now going to fly out of Chicago to avoid Untied and go ANA all the way.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,5,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,7,Peter Nauli,13th August 2014,I flew with my family from CGK to LAX and back from SFO to CGK (2 in business class and 3 in economy class). Business class seems up to expectations but economy class seems a bit cramped especially from Narita to Jakarta. Here are the positive things about ANA: service staff attitude on time performance baggage handling cleanliness inside cabin. But there are negatives as well: hard shell seat on economy class (especially for small aircraft) entertainment is a bit outdated.,,,Business Class,,,3.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,,3,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,9,Giancarlo Treano,6th August 2014,"1 Aug 2014 NH10 in Economy. Ordered tickets with 2 weeks out and no Premium Economy seats available. I've been flying ANA since 2007 and on 1 Aug their check-in at NRT was chaotic to say the least. My wife is Japanese so there was no language barrier. ANA agents kept moving us from counter to counter to check in! It was ridiculous. Finally when we got to the counter it took me about 15 minutes to check in due to the novice agent. Immigration line long but moved fast. Aircraft was spotted close to active runway. However we took off late due to ""airport congestion"". Aircraft was starting to show it's age as as the nose had paint coming off. Not something you would expect to see on ANA. Inside cabin was clean and fresh. Cabin attendants continuously smiled the entire flight. Standard ANA onboard service. I sat on seat 42D. I'm 72inches tall but I had plenty of legroom and the seat was comfortable. IFE wasn't that bad. Lunch was really good. I had the connoisseur selection. Cabin Attendants made continuous drink rounds through the meal service. Seat was comfortable that I slept from Sakhalin to Hudson Bay. Snacks drinks U.S. Entry Documents and 2nd meal were all distributed in a nice manner. Landed in JFK late but immigration wait wasn't that bad. My luggage took forever to arrive on the carousel. Over all the ground experience was really bad but onboard ANA lived up to their high standards. I will be flying them again.",,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes

ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,9,R Singletary,31st July 2014,"Went ORD-NRT-MNL-NRT-ORD. All flights were pleasant with good in-flight service that seemed to have things I would expect as ""above and beyond"" a bit more included even in economy class. In-flight entertainment seemed to be good but the interface they have things running on was a bit cumbersome to figure out at first. In Manila there was a bit more ""document verification"" processes than normal which made the process a bit inconvenient as we were asked to show passports multiple times by airline employees alone.",,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,5,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,8,Perrin Michel,31st July 2014,CDG-NRT. B777-300. Old config. 2x3x2. Old Business Class seats very outdated narrow and hard below LH STD of the same type for instance. Fabulous service as usual. Wines and Champagne are not nice. It has to be said once more. We noticed that 95% of pax are Japanese and probably do not pay attention to that point. But these beverages are below acceptable. Champagne is cheap type no charm wines even worse. New Star alliance at CDG is nice but food - what food ? No food! Unacceptable.,,,Business Class,,,3.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,10,Leebeng Law,29th July 2014,My wife and I had a wonderful experience flying Flight NH1077 on 16 July. The crew were courteous helpful and diligent. Our trip from Seattle to Tokyo Narita took about 10 hrs 25 mins and despite the long distance we very much enjoyed all the facilities and services provided. I couldn't find any shortcomings at all.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,9,Le Quang Kiet,17th July 2014,Travelling with ANA on the route of SGN-NRT-SGN. The flight to Narita was on time but the return trip was delayed due to passenger issue but it was acceptable since ANA's crew kept apologizing and dealt it professionally. The aircraft was a bit old. Inflight entertainment was good. Food was excellent and so was cabin crew. I would give it a 10 out of 10 if the seat were a bit wider.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,9,Lau Ni,17th July 2014,Took ANA Domestic KIX-CTS on 3 July and CTS-NGO on 6 July 2014. Fantastic service on both legs despite KIX-CTS being mostly empty and CTS-NGO being full load. No food offered as it was over an hour for both legs but the crew did water runs twice. The beef consommé offered as an alternative to coffee/tea was excellent. Planes were in good conditions and very clean. No IFE onboard but seats have very good pitch. Overall a very comfortable flights.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,0.0,,5,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,6,Lim Souk Lan,1st July 2014,Singapore to Hokkaido via Tokyo and return. A good performance but nowhere near what I would describe as 5-star. Firstly as many others have mentioned here the shell seats on the 787 are a joke - very very uncomfortable with no possibility of getting into a sleep-friendly position. As far as I'm concerned these seats are a deal-breaker. I would not fly with ANA on a medium or long-haul flight if the seats were this design. The food was acceptable without being outstanding. The service was good but not exceptional. The short hops between Tokyo and Sapporo were efficient and smooth.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,3,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,5,W Callens,30th June 2014,Flew from Haneda to Frankfurt on the Dreamliner. Happy to be on board of that plane as someone who usually gets headaches on long-haul flights you can tell the cabin atmosphere is really a lot better here. I'm not so impressed with the seat width this config had 9 abreast in economy which is really narrow. Prepare for elbow struggles with your neighbor(s). Worst aspect was the food. The flight left at 1am so I can understand they don't start serving hot meals but the replacement sandwich was really extremely basic. Nothing else followed till breakfast which was I'm sad to say awful. I am quite happy with airline food but this was really not tasty not fresh worthless really. I will consider other options on my trips to/from Japan despite the overall professionalism punctuality and nice airplane. One final detail - is it really necessary to close the curtains between economy and business upon landing? I mean rub it in extra that cattle class passengers have to wait deboarding until the elite has left?,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,,3,no
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,10,E Jacobson,25th June 2014,Flew TPE-NRT-ORD on ANA. The first leg was on a 767-300 and the last on 777-300. The first flight seemed a bit more cramped but acceptable. The legroom on the 777 was excellent. I almost had to lean over at times to look at the (huge) IFE screen. The service is always excellent smile and bow as you'd expect from ANA. On arrival to Chicago Japanese speaking agents welcome you and guide you to the immigration area. Real silverware was given on both flights. Excellent food as always.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,10,A Leibiebowitz,25th June 2014,PVG-NRT-JFK Shanghai-Tokyo-New York 6/5/2014: Both flights on 773 one older livery and one new both 3 class. I was originally booked for business class my husband was supposed to be as well however after a screw up by our travel agent he found himself in economy. Although I did not cause a disturbance at the counter I guess my face showed my disappointment at the incompetence of our travel agent. To my surprise the woman checking us in bumped me to first for the first leg of our flight because they couldn't help my husband at that point. Upon our arrival at NRT before disembarking there was an announcement for my husband to see a cabin attendant. They found a seat for him in premium economy NRT-JFK with no extra charge. My husband reported that economy service and entertainment options were very good and the seats were comfortable. I briefly checked out the lounges as I did not want to abandon my husband for too long. Lounges had a good selection of food table service bar changing room etc. In-flight the attendants are what you expect from Japanese service including bowing in multiples. I had a chance to enjoy a full Japanese meal and a Western meal both near excellent the Japanese meal edged ahead for presentation. The entertainment system was not the best I have experienced but it was very good and there are plenty of English and Japanese movies and programing to choose from. The staggered seats are comfortable I have no real problem with the foot cubby. I was pleased to find each seat had an additional cushion which unfolded for making the lie-flat seats even and more comfortable for sleeping. I used it the whole flight even when sitting up. I recommend choosing a seat with the side-table on the aisle they are more private. The check-in and in-flight crew on ANA is one of the most attentive and gracious I have ever come across. In my experience ANA's rating is well deserved.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,10,Mauz Frank,20th June 2014,787 HND-ITA. The usual friendly efficient service of ANA made even better by using the Dreamliner which is aptly named.

ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,7,Woon Wei Seng,18th June 2014,"NRT-SIN on 788 (2-4-2 configuration) NH801 on 16 June. Return leg following SIN-NRT on 31 May on 788. Flight got re-timed by 30 minutes due to ""late arrival of aircraft"". Didn't appreciate it however since this is the final leg of my journey home and I was really tired as I did not sleep on my previous leg from YYZ (12 hours). I was trying to sleep on this flight but I couldn't as the seat was simply too uncomfortable: the fixed-shell non- reclining seat really deters against sleeping. As mentioned in my last review if you intend to stay awake this seat is good. If you intend to sleep and do not fall asleep easily steer clear. In-flight entertainment was still as good but I was too tired to appreciate it. Also the selection of music is quite limited.",,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,8,W Woon,16th June 2014,SIN-NRT on 788 (2-4-2 configuration) NH802 on 31 May. Last flew on ANA in 2011 post-Fukushima on the same route using the 767 and overall it was great. This time round they were still quite good. Staff service is always excellent. I was excited to fly the new 787 plane and it was quite exciting to see the tinted windows and the window in the toilet. And I could feel the difference in the air on-board the 787: skin felt less dry I felt less tired. In-flight entertainment was good. The seat unfortunately remained the fixed-shell kind that does not recline. For someone tall like me it was absolutely uncomfortable as my legs were squeezed against the seat in front. Thankfully I did not intend to sleep that flight sleep would have been impossible. The food surprisingly disappointed me a little: it looked good but did not taste up to my (heightened) expectations. Outside the flight I like how ANA website does automatic online check-in 24 hours before the flight. Overall ANA has been a good experience certainly befitting their Skytrax 5-star rating. If they ditch their fixed-shell seating and offered cheaper tickets (I got my tickets at a promotion otherwise I wont have flown them) I would certainly consider using them for transpacific flights.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,4,C Entrikin,4th June 2014,5/25/2014 Seattle-Tokyo-Ho Chi Minh City. Usually fly 2-3 long haul flights a year. First and last time on ANA- Dreamliner- big disappointment. Studied seat map carefully and picked 2x3x2 seat configuration-however after purchase aircraft was changed to 3x3x3 - sat in the middle. 9.5 hours in overheated cabin and extremely uncomfortable seat that barely reclines. The 767 portion has no recline and equally hard seats. The Dreamliner dedicates 2/3 of plane to First and Business cramming over one half of it's passengers in 1/3 of it's space.

New ANA lounge in NRT is very comfortable has a nice view of the tarmac offers a large variety of food. Unfortunately as onboard wine quality is not as on other airlines. Detailed boarding announcements and smiling staff. Onboard nothing to complain to staggered seats. Very private more even if you have the following seats : 6K 8K 10K etc. or 5A 7A 9A etc. Food perfect Champagne just correct wines not nice. Food is served on demand. Staff spoke a good English.

ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,1,Rene van Zijl,28th May 2014,I feel cheated by ANA. When I booked in BC I could already make the seat reservation. ANA gave the 1-2-1 configuration indicating the latest horizontal seats. For my wife and I I booked the two middle seats on both legs NH206 and 205. At the airport I discovered a 2-3-2 configuration with the old sliding down seats! I was very angry and contacted ANA they replied that ANA has the right to change the configuration without notice to the passenger. The seat is one of the worst I have flown narrow very hard and sliding down! Sleeping almost impossible!,,,Business Class,,,1.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,2,no

The cabin was very hot which made it even worse. And my wife and I were separated because of the change in aircraft configuration. On a positive note the flight attendants were friendly and efficient and the selection of Hollywood movies was nice. The bathrooms were clean and the food was OK. But it's all about the seat. I can only recommend to small people who can tolerate hot cabin temperatures.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,,2,no

ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,8,S Anna,15th May 2014,LAX-HAN. Previously flew this same route in economy class and found ANA's service in that class to be comparable to business/first class on most other airlines. I was not disappointed with the business class experience in ANA as the service was quite outstanding. Attention was paid to every little thing from cleaning toilets after use to offering beverage or food the moment one's eyes flutter open after some sleep. The entertainment system offered a full compliment of Hollywood Japanese and a few international films along with music television shows (mostly Japanese) and games. Since this was a red eye flight meals were a simple amuse (delicious although my husband wouldn't eat it because it was far too exotic) along with a breakfast meal before landing. I opted for the Japanese breakfast and the presentation was both outstanding and quite delicious. They also offer many wonderful snacks during the flight and my mother-in-law fell in love with the Ippu-do ramen dish she had as a mid-flight snack. My only problem was with the seat which is somewhat of a lie down configuration although the leg portion of the seats hangs downward. I could only feel comfortable laying on my side even though portions of the seat dug into my hip. Still definitely worth the price of flying.,,,Business Class,,,1.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes

Return flight different airplane seats 3 rows outside 3 in middle. It was the most cramped of any flight I have ever taken including domestic. An agonizing trip. The service is quintessentially Japanese: gracious efficient. It is just that 2/3 of the seats are taken up by almost totally empty business and first class seats.

ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,9,Perrin Michel,8th May 2014,JFK-NRT B777 Seat 6E. A Fantastic experience. Perfect check-in: an employee put our luggage on balance no belt transportation for C pax luggage. Poor BA lounge in JFK not at NH standards. First part of Business class cabin is extremely quiet (8 pax only). New seats offer a huge space nearly a suite much larger than any competitor on 777. Food top quality Japanese and French. Beef was rare as requested. French Champagne was good (not a Premium one). Wines not so good unfortunately. Fabulous Sake. First meal was served at the right speed. A nice surprise: during the following 11 hours of flight meals could be served at any time on demand with a large choice of food. Cabin attendant spoke perfect English and were extremely efficient.

Boarding was orderly but they allow too many carry on bags onboard the crew had a difficult time closing the overhead bins. As you can imagine 10 across seating is really cramped. Flight was about 1 hour 45 mins with no inflight entertainment except headsets for listening to music and scattered video monitors showing a Japanese documentary. Service wise was bad and minimal. Onboard for an hour and 45 min flight you are only offered water oolong tea and apple juice. No other drinks available not even orange juice. Asked the FA for ice and she just pointed to her drinks. For the price we paid as it was not cheap its definitely not worth it. For Japanese standard of service its appalling.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1,no

Everything was fine futuristic IFE system on a nice reclining seat except for breakfast options. A little bit non-edible porridge or tasteless omelette with cold bread. I tried other ANA flights and their menus are all fine except for this horrible breakfast menu on SE. Asia routes (got exactly the same option for Jakarta - Tokyo route in 2013).

ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,8,M Gephart,16th April 2014,NRT-BKK-NRT Economy. Booked the ticket through UA and as they have recently cancelled their own NRT-BKK service opted for the ANA routing. I found the boarding in NRT to be a bit chaotic and even though they had lanes for Biz Class and Star Gold it was kind of a free-for-all. Both directions on 777-200 aircraft which disappointedly are starting to show their age. I found the legroom to be quite tight and toward the end of the 6+ hour flight was really starting to feel it. The service was typical ANA - very warm very welcoming very attentive. Overall a good experience and value for the money. Would certainly recommend them.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5,yes

The aircraft is very advanced starting with USB power charger in flight adjustable filter light windows toilet seat had water spray and it closed itself. Touch screens had the newest movies very polite stewardess and the food is gourmet! Their Japanese menu had grilled salmon teriyaki and crab legs.

But when mistakes happen the inflight crew should not be blaming travel agents or ground staff. They even promised to ensure everything would be taken care of for the return. A simple confirmation call to the reservations center made me realize nothing was taken care of.

ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,8,Cheron Heidi,6th April 2014,AXT-HND-HNL-NRT-HND-AXT. Due to connecting flight within Japan I decided to take the midnight flight to Honolulu from Haneda rather than the earlier flight from Narita. I don't recommend this flight as before the departure from Haneda virtually all the airport food service and retailers have already closed. In spite of not being able to find anything to eat before the flight the first meal offered on the flight was the snack with the hot meal served about 3 hours before arrival. (The order of the meals is reversed on the Narita flight). Next time I will make the airport transfer between Haneda and Narita (about 2 1/2 hrs using Keisei & Keikyu Railways) to get the Narita flight to HNL. All other aspects of ANA service were great as usual.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,3,Tercon Bojan,17th March 2014,On the Tokyo (Narita) to Fukuoka segment ANA uses an ancient A320. The interior was upholstered in a deep green which does not even resemble the current ANA blue colour. The plane definitely had a retro feel. Moreover it was nearly empty. 20 pax on a 166 seat plane. Thankfully it's a short commuter flight. They could jazz up the whole experience though and make those 90 minutes a bit more exciting.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,3,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,3,Tercon Bojan,17th March 2014,For this 90 min shuttle flight from Fukuoka to Tokyo - Haneda ANA packs in the seats fitting 405 seats on an old 777-200. That's the dreaded 10 seats abreast. Thankfully the flight was not full so we could spread out. The service is minimal as is the interior design giving this flight a truly bus-like feel. I know these flights are meant to be practical but why do they have to also make them boring?,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,3,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,9,Dave Noble,10th March 2014,SJC-NRT. Would normally fly United on transatlantic/transpacific so decided to use ANA through United website from my local airport. Couldn't check in because I had a United ticket but when I got to the check in desk I had already been assigned an aisle seat based on my United 1k profile and the seat next to me was blocked off so I had plenty of room. I also asked for a Japanese meal and when I boarded the FA came to verify my meal request. SJC-NRT is a 787 dreamliner and is spacious and bright inside. Like the ability to adjust windows at the touch of a button. Inflight service was excellent attentive and very polite. What a difference from United! I like having in seat power and USB charger even in economy. Only negative is that the seat is a hard shell so it's almost impossible to sleep on it. I can normally sleep on planes but couldn't on this. Both flights into NRT and SJC arrived an hour early. SJC is less hassle than SFO and easy to get in and out.

Culinary offerings (European and Japanese) were delicious and made dining equivalent to eating at a five star restaurant. Cabin crew were attentive but not intrusive. Every time I used the washroom it appeared to be serviced after every use as the toilet paper ends were triangulated.,,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,1,A Ohno,5th March 2014,HKG-HND paid full price for economy ticket yet got an awful seat in a separate partitioned area of 2 rows right behind business class. About 5 or 6 babies in the vicinity all crying at various intervals. Furthermore seat was incredibly uncomfortable - not the regular seats but the seat cushion is shorter and dips down in the center putting pressure on thighs. When I asked to change seats FA just brushed me off even though there were a couple empty seats elsewhere. The IFE? Tiny low res screen audio was on/off due to ageing headphone input jack.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,1,no
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,5,S Murphy,3rd March 2014,Ignoring that the flight was late and meant I had to get a bus to Haneda from Narita to make my connection the SIN-NRT sector on ANA's 787 was immensely uncomfortable. The seats are the 'shelled' non-reclining type and are advertised as having a seat pitch of 34 inches but in practice I was only able to slide my seat forward an inch or so before my knees jarred into the seat-back in front. The result was 7 hours of night flight in a lot of discomfort and any suspected benefit of flying in a 787 totally lost. Staff were unerringly polite and IFE was good but both of these positives were overwhelmed by the discomfort. Why have ANA gone this route when their CX peers had already paid the price and fallen on the 'rigid economy seat' sword? Madness.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,4,no
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,6,Jason Wong,3rd March 2014,Flew from NRT to SIN. 7 hours flight but there was only one meal. The same flight on United serves 2 meals. The meal was good though with pictures illustrating what to choose. Plenty of refills of warm Japanese green tea. My major complaint is the small seats. The plane was the new Dreamliner 787 but the seats are clearly designed for Japanese people with legroom significantly less than that of United and other US carrier. It is quite hard to get out if you are stuck in a middle seat. I do like the spray toilet in the bathroom. Good service overall but definitely not the most comfortable flight.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,3,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,10,M Matsuda,20th February 2014,A return flight to/from Frankfurt and Haneda on newly configured 787 (Economy Premium Economy and Business). The configuration in Economy has been changed from 2-4-2 to 3-3-3 but the seat was replaced from Back-fixed to normal reclining seat. The seat was actually more comfortable than the Back-Fixed seat and I felt less tired after a 12 hour flight. In fact one of the cabin crews told me that they had received many complaints on the Back-Fixed seat from passengers. The cabin crews on both flights were very friendly and helpful. They regularly walked around the cabin with drinks to serve. It is very different from some European airlines that all cabin crews vanish completely after the first meal and never see them until the second meal is served.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,3,yes

ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,10,Michael Kemp,10th February 2014,HCMC to Narita to Washington to Toronto January 2014. I travel to and from Asia a couple of times a year. This was my first time on ANA. I will travel on this airline again whenever possible. The price was very reasonable. The service was excellent. The Japanese menu was wonderful. I usually don't eat airline food so this was a really great change. The baggage check in was courteous swift and helpful. Boarding was the same. Aircraft including washrooms was very clean with no blankets pillows head phones. They could expand the selection of movies for long haul flights.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,10,B Duston,28th January 2014,Recently took a flight from Bangkok-Tokyo-JFK. Admittedly the seat on the Bangkok-Tokyo segment on a 777 was not comfortable. The leg extension was rather short and my feet extended over the edge of the leg rest. I am not a particularly tall person. The flight to JFK did have lie flat seats but I found them to be quite narrow and felt more comfortable sleeping at a slightly angled upright position. Food on both segments was OK and typical of business class fare found on other airlines. What sets ANA apart from other airlines is their onboard staff. Simply put their staff has to be the warmest and friendliest I have encountered on any other flights that I have taken. Everything was done with a smile. Cabins and bathrooms were kept immaculate throughout the flights. The AVOD system worked great with tons of offerings to choose from. I recommend ANA.,,,Business Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,4,yes

ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,7,P Rubenstein,7th January 2014,Business class seat on the staggered B777 config. NRT-BKK route. The seat only seemed to offer 2 positions upright or lie flat. Not a comfortable seat and somewhat out of date. IFE selection was not as expansive as other airlines and the controls were not particularly responsive. Food service was geared to the Japanese pax. The overall meal presentation was beautiful in typical ANA fashion but nothing on offer was particularly appealing to me. I opted for a stewed piece of meat wrapped in a finely minced type of hamburger. It was not particularly palatable with an emphasis upon bland. It was inedible. Cabin service was directed at the Japanese pax while I felt ignored. FAs were professional but I was ignored having to ask for a refill on a drink or coffee. It isn't the first time I have had this experience on ANA and yet  it is something I only experience on ANA and never on any other Asian carrier. I don't know why this airline merits 5 stars as nothing on the flight was exceptional or not done in a better fashion on several of ANA's lower rated competitors in the region.,,,Business Class,,,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,,3,no
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,9,R Howe,6th January 2014,HIJ-HRT-LRH (Economy).

ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,7,Lagu Bonari,2nd January 2014,I flew from Seattle-Narita-Singapore and then back through San Francisco. I'm writing to warn people about the new 3-3-3 economy seat 787 configuration. In short it was the single most uncomfortable flight of my life. I had a window seat and I was jammed in under the curvature of the airplane. The service food and entertainment were excellent but the terrible tiny seat overshadowed everything else. In Narita I switched planes to a 787 with the old 2-4-2 configuration and it was like moving to business class. I recommend inquiring what configuration you will ride prior to booking - the 3-3-3 is quite bad.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,no
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,6,M McGrath,30th December 2013,Narita to Hong Kong in Business. Very disappointed with our 4.5 hour flight on 28 December. Our first ANA experience and we had high expectations. Check in was very good but went downhill from there. Was directed to the United lounge which is cavernous but poor selection of food for breakfast. On board the 767 the seats had limited recline which made sleeping difficult. Biggest disappointment was the food. I had high hopes for the Japanese selection but what I was offered for lunch was bland and poorly presented. My wife wanted the international menu (no choice) but was advised it had run out even though we were seated in the second row. No cheese or fruit was available as a substitute. The over the top apology from the chief cabin supervisor was embarrassing. No amenities kit. Cathay is streets ahead of this airline and I did not understand on this outing why it is 5 stars.,,,Business Class,,,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,,3,no
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,10,Mike Roosenzweig,29th December 2013,Flew Economy from Seattle - Narita - Bangkok. Overall flights were very nice. Flew on a new 787 from Seattle to Narita. Plane was very clean and comfortable and IFE had a great selection of movies. Japanese meal set was also very good too. Crew were very friendly and even though it was a very full flight the plane felt very comfortable and the large windows and great interior lighting made the trip enjoyable. Second leg from NFRT to BKK was on an older 777-200. Plane was clean but seats were worn and no where near as comfortable as the 787. IFE was older variety with ok selection of movies on a low resolution screen. Again food was very good and crew was very friendly. Only minor complaint would be that the 777-200 that I was on could use a nice interior refresh but other than that it was a great flight!,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,9,Nicolas Mazza,29th December 2013,ORD-NRT NH11 23/12. NRT-BKK NH915 24/12. ANA are an excellent airline with professional and very polite crew. Even in economy food is very good you have a choice of international or Japanese speciality. Forks and knives are not in plastic. Planes are very clean even after 13hr flight. Negative point is probably seat stiffness.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,8,N Halperin,17th December 2013,"LHR-NRT-FUK outbound. 773 on the first leg with newer cabin. Full meals of dinner and breakfast were served and 2 choices for each however the taste wasn't as good as some cheaper flights I've been on. But I certainly didn't go hungry. Constant drink rounds from the cabin crew who were always extremely efficient friendly and helpful. Seat could not be reclined and I knew this in advance but it really was impossible to get any sleep in such a position even for a 5'5"" individual. However the seat features were good many cup holders large screen/modern IFE USB port. IFE had many programmes and features although I did not watch any of them. Toilets were always very clean and well maintained. ANA must have priority on the route as we made it in 10hr 50min arriving almost an hour early. Originally I was very concerned I would miss the connection beforehand but I had loads of time Narita international to domestic transfer was swift. Connection to FUK was provided by ANA Wings but it was only 2 hours although we departed late. Was given a drink but no food. Seats were more comfortable even on an old 737. Return flight from NRT-LHR was much the same as the first. Would fly again if I needed a particular connection that only ANA operate.",,,Economy Class,,,1.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,3,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,10,T Waldman,12th December 2013,Flew NH1 (IAD-NRT) 2143 (NRT-FUK) 2 (NRT-IAD). I was very satisfied with my experience aboard ANA. It was my second trip with them and the services had changed slightly. Ground-side staff were polite and efficient including at Narita where representatives gave clear directions for rechecking baggage following Customs. Some airside amenities had changed since my previous trip in 1/09. Things like ice cream were no longer free after meals instead at the time they had an a la carte menu from which you could order business class treats like sake or udon for a modest fee. The udon was fantastic for a midnight snack. I had a special meal (vegetarian) registered and cabin crew served those first (which I guess was awkward for folks like me) but they indeed arrived vegetarian as advertised. IFE was stocked with a good mix of fairly recent western and Japanese films television shows and music. I seldom felt the need to turn to my iPod. Seats were comfortable and pitched well enough for this average-sized American male. Fukuoka connection: I wasn't awake for a lot of the flight but we were provided light beverages. IFE included a documentary program and a flight map. Otherwise the service was comparable to the international product.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,2,Thomas Brooke,9th December 2013,"We flew Economy from SeaTac to Narita in October 2012 on the 787 and the flight seating was comfortable enough. The in-flight entertainment was excellent and the food & service very good. This year we took the same ANA Economy flight from SeaTac to Narita in October 2013 and the flight seating was terrible. In the past year ANA has changed the main Economy seating configuration from 2-3-2 to 3-3-3 and reduced the amount of space between seat rows to squeeze in more ""sardines into the same can"". It is so tight that the person directly in front has to move their seat to the upright position to adequately allow the food trays to fit onto the very small fold out tray. As well the newly instituted one (1) suitcase rule is very inadequate for those of us going for extended trips. Since the return flight home was re-directed to Portland OR due to ""fog/visibility problems"" at SeaTac and a series of subsequent problems our flight finally arrived ~8 hours late and this afforded an opportunity to speak with many other passengers. I found that many/most other passengers in the Economy cabin were of the same general opinion and would now strongly consider other options for their next trip. Options including flying to SF or Vancouver to get a more comfortable flight. ANA had a good product and through these changes of seat configuration has now given other carriers offering direct flights to Japan an excellent opportunity to compete and beat. We are now ""in-play"" and will not take another ANA flight to Japan w/o first understanding more about the seating arrangement. We did try to upgrade in Narita to Premium Economy but were allowed to do that; since they said we had a ""discount ticket"" i.e. tickets purchase through a Travel Agency and we paid what they asked. Not a good experience!",,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,2,no
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,,George Santana,9th December 2013,Took flight 937 from Tokyo to Jakarta as part of my UA Star Alliance flight from the US. The US portion to Narita was fine. I had purchased upgrade to Business First using mile and co-pay but the ANA portion from NRT to Jakarta was a clear horror story. Seat 17C did not recline but had some silly seat cushion that supposedly moved but for 7.5 hours it was excruciating. I will never again fly ANA.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,,1,no
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,,Jeff Pearson,4th December 2013,San Jose California to Tokyo to Guangzhou China. This one suitcase requirement is ridiculous. Every other airline is two bags. Even if you are over by a lb or two they will charge you 50 dollars. If we knew this we never would have used this airline. Try going to China (my wife's homeland) with one suitcase. Sorry we tried but never again. Guess we will go back to Cathcay. At least they fly into Hong Kong about 2 hours shorter. Very discouraged and never again.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3,no

ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,8,Steve Siauw,7th November 2013,ANA domestic flight Tokyo HND - Hiroshima HIJ return. Outbound with older B777-200 inbound with the new B787-8. Services are so so. Can't complain much since it was just a short 90 min-domestic flight. FAs hand out simple drinks apple juice coke hot/cold tea/coffee but nothing to eat. For those understand Japanese a 60-min-TV documentary-like program is on during the flight. Economy seats are a bit cramped. Usually B777s are configured 3-3-3 but ANA made them 3-4-3 instead. B787-8 has newer seats (still 3-4-3) bigger window and better interior lighting but still no change in in-flight services.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,3.0,0.0,,3,yes

I fly 2-3 times internationally per year on all different airlines and the service was among the best I'd experienced. The staff were attentive and polite and hardworking. They neve stopped working - every minute or so someone else would walk by and offer us water or hot tea or a small towel. I asked if there was an extra packet of rice crackers I could have the attendant returned within 60 seconds and offered me a tray on which were 3 different rice cracker selections.

ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,9,E Simon,4th November 2013,LAX-HND-GMP-HND-LAX 772 and 763. HND on the older 777-200. Seat is slightly harder but not uncomfortable during each 10+hour flight. I am 5'10 with long legs. Seat pitch just good enough. TV's sufficient for the purpose with just enough English offerings doing two red-eyes. However half were 'classic' movies so you may run out of new things by second leg if you do not sleep. One complete meal prior to landing with a snack after departure. Snack was a bit lacking but the meal was good. Service is truly excellent. Staff is very polite but English levels vary greatly. 767-300 intra-asia.

We were in the older aircraft not the new staggered seat layout. A wonderful crew fantastic multi-course lunch old style video machines (not screens) and somewhat uncomfortable seats made for a good but not perfect flight.

ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,10,Tom Mannion,4th November 2013,October 2 business class SEA to NRT on the Dreamliner 787. A terrific aircraft a fantastic crew and delicious food! One drawback: the seats in the center side by side with the staggered cabin arrangement provided too much privacy for us traveling as a couple. The center console is so high we could not see each other while seated could not converse could not share the dining experience. So one of us moved to an empty seat across the aisle and our flight became a shared experience. The business cabin was almost empty on this flight. The cabin crew were always available always smiling and the bow before the safety announcements so wonderfully Japanese.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes

ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,1,R Snodgrass,2nd October 2013,LAX-HND on Boeing 777. ANA used to be one of my favorites I was a bronze member in 2010 and 2011. It has steadily declined since the mid 2000s and its economy class should now be considered solely for Japanese people wedded to Japanese airlines. It combines the worst of an American-style approach (cut costs to the bone) with the worst of Japanese service (absolutely no independent thought/action on the part of flight attendants and no exceptions. I recently had to endure pain for an entire 12+ hour flight for a reason that would have been easily remedied by a flight attendant on another airline. Economy seats are terribly cramped food is cheap and primarily carbohydrates (bread/rice) flight attendants have poor English skills and English-language video offerings are lacking. On the positive side flight attendants are polite smile a lot and apologize for their mistakes. You don't necessarily need to avoid it but given a choice between ANA and another major Asian or US airline choose the other airline.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,,1,no
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,9,Z Singh,5th September 2013,NRT-SJC on Boeing 787. The seat was comfortable for economy and had a generous 34 inch pitch. ANA is a very good airline with efficient attentive and very courteous service. The food was good but if you are vegetarian or do not eat red meat then be sure to order a special meal. Each seat had a laptop power port and the AVOD was better than average but if they do another AVOD refresh they will be one of the best Asian carriers. They do rank in my top 5 best airlines that I have flown Next you want to fly to Asia give ANA a try you will not regret it.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,3,yes

ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,9,N Singh,30th July 2013,DEL-NRT-SJC and back. DEL-NRT leg was Boeing 767 while NRT-SJC was Dreamliner 787. The latter is an experience by itself. Windows can be made from transparent to translucent to near opaque by touch of a button located on the window seat. Cabin luggage storage capacity is great and still designed to give a greater sense of space within the aircraft. Lavatories are worth mentioning. The door opening is more convenient and don't have to be pushed like older aircraft. Basin is wider hand motion sensitive and self-draining. Toilet seat is also motion activated for closure and flush. Overall journey in the Dreamliner is less tiring than older aircraft. Cabin crew and staff exemplary. Very courteous always smiling and ready to help. They are always around even when the lights have been dimmed pay prompt attention to any requests pick up anything lying on the floor or elsewhere and cleanliness level is great. Highly recommend flying by this airline.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,5,yes

The seats contain a plug to charge the computer! The seat is comfortable even though it does not recline. The food was nice and the crew kept strolling with drinks during the flight. I thought they were attentive and extremely polite. 3 of the 4 flights had some sort of delays mostly due to bad weather and tarmac wait. We were well informed and the crew did its best to speak to each passenger when there were connections. In flight entertainment is not very rich in international movies (other than Japanese). Overall fly on ANA is a major step up compared any US airline and Air Canada.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,5,yes

ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,6,P Sim,11th July 2013,SIN-Haneda-Chitose then Hakodate-Haneda-SIN. The service was excellent. They did their best to re-arrange the seating so one of us could be with the elderly passengers in our Group. In Hakodate airport we did not ask for priority boarding but staff at the gate noticed and invited us for priority boarding even though we are not seated near the gate. The food is so so but we were on red-eye so it could just be that the breakfast selection is limited. For the inflight entertainment the screen is a bit too bright for red-eye flight even at the lowest brightness settings. The seat is the worst. We have no problem with the short domestic flights but it is just too uncomfortable for international flight over 6 hours. The thin pillow provided does not help to cushion the hardness and it is also not sufficient to fill up the gap in your lower back when you slide the seat forward. The head rest can be adjusted but it is still a bit high for me even at the lowest setting.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,4,no
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,1,R Ramsay,23rd June 2013,Flight from Narita to JFK June 14 2013. Flight attendants were inattentive (and this was business class) spoke little English.

ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,8,A Yong,10th June 2013,Singapore - Narita - Los Angeles and San Francisco - Narita - Singapore. Smooth friendly check-in for all flights all on time. All legs with pretty new aircraft 767-300 within Asia and 777-300ER transpacific. Both aircraft had the new Economy interior with fixed-back seats which are roomy and great for everything except sleeping. Like many other comments have noted the cushioning is inadequate and the recline too awkward for proper sleep. Seat pitch is slightly more generous on the 777 than the 767. Otherwise fantastic service as usual from ANA cabin crew all smiles throughout the flight helpful and responsive to requests however if I had to nitpick I'd say the standard of English is below other non-native-speaking Asian cabin crew like Cathay and Thai. Food was good especially on the transpacific legs (I picked the Japanese option throughout). You get one meal SIN-NRT and two meals NRT-LAX-SFO with frequent beverage rounds. IFE was so-so; the new displays are large but I found the AVOD selection rather lacking compared to other major airlines.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,5,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,7,M Stewart,10th June 2013,SIN-NRT-SFO and LAX-NRT-SIN. 767 Cradle Chair on the SIN-NRT-SIN legs in a 2x1x2 layout. Flight attendants were great and the chair comfortable for a day light flight. NRT-SFO and LAX-NRT was in the new 777 with staggered lay flat seats. Flight attendants on these legs didn't seem as engaging or interested as the flights from Singapore. Also pyjamas are available on these long haul flights but are not offered you have to ask for them. Also no amenity kit is offered. Food on board is fine as long as you love fish otherwise you will go hungry. There was one Non-Fish main meal available on each flight so really no choice at all. I would expect more from a business class meal service.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,9,Zhou Ji Yuan,9th June 2013,SFO to NRT on March 20. Check in staff at SFO very friendly and smiling. Boarding process is very organized. Y class seat is little too hard with a little bit narrow seat pitch. Two meals were served during the flight both very tasty and good-looking. Staff smiled all the way served drinks almost every 30 minutes and responded to requests from passengers very attentively. IFE was very good on their new cabin product of B777-300ER containing various choice of Western and Oriental movies with subtitle in different languages.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,9,A Paul,6th June 2013,San Francisco to Japan to Philippines. Service was excellent. Great crew. Great attention. I requested a seat change a while ago and when we got off the flight in Japan a service member was holding a sign with our name and walked us to change seats. We were impressed. This was our first time using ANA and for the price and service they've exceeded our expectations.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,9,Sasha Takeuchi,29th May 2013,NRT to FRA in economy. Took off on time. The seat is very new and comfortable with very large legroom. Cabins are new too (777-300ER). Meal service is very good they serve appetizers before the hot meal hot meals very good (it's same for breakfast). Cabin attendants are very polite but it's shame they don't speak very good English.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,3,Paulin Rio,26th May 2013,NRT to BKK. 05/20. Flight was really old the screen was not clean and seat too small. Food was ok but not many movies to choose from compared to other airlines. Ticket price much more expensive than other airlines but not at the same quality level.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,,2,no
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,10,S English,20th May 2013,"NH201 NRT-LHR March Boeing 777-300. Personalised check-in through separate lounge area at Narita and use of ANA's stylish Suite lounge go a long way in helping to relieve any pre-flight stress. Once you are onboard and seated in your semi-private ""booth"" you are rewarded with an extremely comfortable fully reclining seat/bed and there is a very good entertainment system. Where the service excels though is with the flight crew and the dining experience. Having lived a long time in Japan I thought I had already experienced ""first class"" service and hospitality many times but that provided on my flight was the best I have ever experienced. And the food well all I can say is please try some Japanese options and don't forget dessert and the wine list. Simply fantastic!",,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,1,S Ogawa,19th May 2013,Flight 950 from MNL-NRT. Delayed 2 hours. Not one apology heard from any crew member or customer service. Service was so so. Nothing spectacular. older style 767. Audio Visual didn't work and when I told a crew member she said she would look into it. Never came back. Pretty bad service especially when other airlines are priced cheaper.,,,Business Class,,,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,,1,no
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,9,Sam Rahm,15th May 2013,Recently flew NRT-DEL-NRT-SEA on ANA. Overall impression was superb - probably the best airline experience in 20 years of travel. Crew were spotlessly dressed and smiled through the whole flight. Food well presented though a heavy Japanese influence as expected. Seats were lie-flat and not full recline due to removal of 787 from service (which they profusely apologized for). Only negative was 3 hour delay from NRT-SEA due to bad weather but made up one hour in the air. It was like night and day as compared to UA experience from SEA-NRT which was abysmal at best. Would not hesitate to use again.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,8,Lars Kitschke,14th May 2013,Route FRA-HND and NRT-FRA. Because of the grounding of the Dreamliner the flight to HND was in a 777-200 with domestic seats. This was a little bit hard. The Entertainment and the meals were absolutely great. Very friendly crew. The trip to FRA was 777-300ER this was the best Economy experience I've taken.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,10,Charles Kennedy,13th May 2013,"HND-CTS-HND nice to still be able to fly domestic 747s in Japan (JAL have grounded their fleet). Outbound was operated by ""Picachu Dreaming"" the all-yellow jumbo with Pokemon characters painted along the side with the eponymous Picachu on the tail. Interior also had Pokemon detail (eg headrests curtains). Very charming. Service was a hot green tea. Aircraft mostly empty. Crew profusely apologetic about substituting the promised 787 with the jumbo but I don't see why it made a difference. Return to the capital on another 747 in the evening was equally nice had a seat in Economy upstairs. Flight attendant asked me what I was doing in Sapporo when I said it was to do with aviation and that I chose Nippon as I love the jumbo she went away and came back with a postcard of a 747 and on the back had written thank you for flying with us today signed by half a dozen crew with a Hello Kitty sticker attached! She also gave me a small bag of Nippon sweets and pens. Landed smoothly on time back at Haneda and parked next to Picachu Dreaming at the end of a great day.",,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,0.0,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,2,J Yancey,13th May 2013,"Haneda to LAX on 777-200 in economy class. These seats were the most uncomfortable I have even had the displeasure to be in. They are very narrow seats and the leg room was tight. If you are 5'2"" and weigh 100 lbs. I guess they would be ok. It was not possible to recline the seat very much because the bottom of the back part of the seat cut into your back it was miserable. The seat cushion was shallow and gave very little support to your bottom. The food started off with a sandwich which seemed about the same you would receive from a vending machine. The meal service two hours from landing in LAX was mediocre at best. I will never fly ANA. My comparison is seven other airlines I have used over the years trans-pacific. ANA is the worst for comfort and food.",,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,,2,no
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,10,A Acosta,5th May 2013,LAX-NRT 777-300ER. FA's stop to pick up every little thing dropped and do everything to keep aircraft spotless. Service was always with a smile. This is my new preferred airline of choice. NRT-BKK 767-300 same excellent service but aircraft was worn and seats seemed to be closer together. Based on service of FA I won't hesitate to choose ANA in the future.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,10,M Finch,4th May 2013,San Francisco to Tokyo in economy class. This was the first time my wife and I have flown an international flight with ANA. From the moment we checked in everyone was extremely polite professional and even smiled. A smile goes a long way. The aircraft was clean and had the hard shell seats that slide forward instead of reclining. This took some getting used to but I managed since I didn't have anything under the seat in front of me. I don't think large people will like this style of seat. The benefit is not having the seat in front of you recline into your lap. The seat backs were higher and the top pf the seat did not taper to a head rest. The top of the seat back was the same width as the rest of the seat back. This allowed for a much larger video screen. I usually need to wear my reading glasses to watch movies but not this time! They also had room to put the remote next to the screen. Nobody hitting the seat back behind me like those touch screens and no remote in the arm rest taking up space. I also liked the foot rest. It gave me another option when adjusting to get comfortable. The differences with this aircraft did not stop there. The lavatory had automatic faucets. No need to push down and hope the water would last long enough to wash your hands. There was a beverage holder on the back of the tray table so you didn't need to pull down the tray table for only a drink. Then when you did pull down the tray table for your food there was another beverage holder in the seat back so you had more room on your tray. The main dinner course was excellent. By far the best airline food my wife and I have had in economy. Then another cart came by with miso soup. As if that wasn't enough an FA came by with Haggendaz ice cream for dessert. Throughout the flight beverage carts were making their rounds offering the soft drinks juices wine and beer. FAs walking around offering three different types of hot tea and another one offering coffee. We were rarely interrupted with those annoying long announcements in English and Japanese throughout the flight. When the seatbelt light came on no announcement. Instead FAs walked the aisles to ensure everyone was wearing their seatbelt. When dinner was served FAs carried a menu to show you what was being offered. All of the small details made a huge difference from our experiences with United and Delta. This flight was part of a trip which included flights with United. Too bad ANA cannot offer US domestic flights. United could learn a lot from ANA.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,8,Peter Goldsbury,4th April 2013,Hiroshima-Narita-Frankfurt-Amsterdam-Munich-Narita-Haneda-Hiroshima. For the first leg of this trip the plane was operated by IBEX and arrived on schedule. I have bad knees so I need assistance. It was offered each time. Plane to Frankfurt was a 777-300 and the flight attendant greeted me by my seat number: 24C. Service was excellent and the AVOD superb. Food was reasonable. For the changeover I had a courier who took me straight through passport control to the gate. Without this assistance I would not have made the connection. Flight to Amsterdam operated by Lufthansa and the difference was rather obvious. Nevertheless food and drink were served on the 50-minute flight. On the return trip the Lufthansa flight to Munich took off late and I was concerned about the connection. I was taken to the ANA plane by car and made the connection without difficulty. Departure delayed 2 hours however while the plane was de-iced and it was here that the superb ANA service was slightly lacking: given relatively little information. After takeoff the flight was good but again I was not told about the arrangements for assistance at Narita. 777-300 arrived well behind schedule and I missed the connection to Hiroshima. I was given a bus ticket to Haneda hotel accommodation next to Terminal 2 and had been booked on the first flight to Hiroshima the following day. I upgraded my ticket to Prestige Class on the 767 and had a pleasant Japanese breakfast. All in all the level of service was very good and I would recommend ANA as my preferred airline.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,9,M Auburn,28th March 2013,Tokyo to Frankfurt changed ticket from Lufthansa and tried ANA. Excellent seats with nice flat sleeping bed surface with nice cover and pillow. Food was really good tasty hot and nice choice of wines.

ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,2,M Kakishima,27th March 2013,LAX-HND-ITM round trip. Staff at check in unfriendly and confused. Requested special meals not onboard.

ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,6,Richard Mest,27th February 2013,JFK-Tokyo staggered seating - excellent. Staff friendly but did not make any extra effort. I went to galley 3 times for a wine fill-up during dinner because of non existent service. Spoke with purser about this after meal and for rest of flight had an FA on me every minute which was also quite awkward. They really had no idea of proper service. Tokyo-Manila - ridiculous old plane inedible food but lovely if not apologetic service. Very disappointed.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3,no
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,8,O Alvarado,25th February 2013,LAX-NRT-MNL flights enjoyable. The food and services were good and cabins and toilets were clean.

ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,8,Haobin Wu,4th February 2013,Beijing Capital-Tokyo Narita NH 956 Boeing 767-300. The check-in procedure was friendly my baggage was directly checked to Seattle where my final destination is. I was taking ANA flight from Tokyo to Seattle but the flight was cancelled due to the suspension of 787 so they signed me to another United flight. Their apology was really sincere. On this flight the seat was comfortable with a fair pitch and recline the IFE was friendly with mostly Japanese movies and some Hollywood movies. Games and TV programmes were good. The cabin crews are very friendly with very good attitude and enthusiasm to serve you. The meal was the part that satisfies me the most. It's one of the most delicious in-flight food I've eaten. Very nice and enjoyable flight!,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,5,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,2,Y Ogawa,31st January 2013,Took NH 1063 from HND to HNL earlier this month. The check in process was horrible. The Agent failed to let me know where the lounge was and didn't let me know that I was able to access the lounge since I was on an international business class ticket. I found the lounge and nothing fancy. Children were running around the food and drink selection was ok. Flight was uneventful. Seats on 767 product are clearly old. The comparable product on both JAL and UAL are much better at a better price. The food was horrible the entertainment system was old and the inflight service didn't tell me about snacks that I could have ordered at anytime. Would I fly them again? Probably not. They have good staff they just need to know how to respect the customers and staff.,,,Business Class,,,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,,1,no
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,5,L Andres,30th January 2013,Took ANA from SEA-NRT-MNL and back. Flight from SEA to NRT and NRT to SEA were both 3 hours delayed. B787 was very nice comfy and lots of leg room. Cabin lights switched automatically and helped in resting. B777 interior is not good. Seats are too tight and not enough leg room. Food and drinks are the best though. B767 is much better than their B777. Poor inflight entertainment very few selections. Will I fly with ANA again? No not until they get better with their schedules and fix their B777 interiors. If they will use their 787s completely I might consider flying with them again. ANA's best asset - their flight crew very hardworking and the best customer service I've had in a flight.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,,3,no
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,10,P Lee,16th January 2013,Flew NH001 from IAD to NRT. Seat 2A. The existing 1st seat is more than satisfactory though its controls are worn and dated. As always NH service was excellent from the pyjamas 10-course Japanese and/or Western meals to the excellent alcohol selections. FAs always seemed to keep an eye out for passengers needing anything. Their attention to every detail was impressive. The IFE needed some updating. I strongly recommend ANA.,,,First Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,8,Thomas Woodtli,19th December 2012,I had the opportunity to fly on the Dreamliner from Frankfurt to Tokyo-Haneda on November 16 2012. The first impression of the cabin was wonderful and spacious. Not to mention huge windows. ANA has installed seats which don't recline so do not to bother the passenger behind. The seat cushions aren't that smooth but acceptable for long-haul flights. The food was excellent with typically Japanese flavours.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,6,M Matsuda,19th December 2012,Flight between LHR and NRT (B777-300ER). First time to experience the fixed back seat. The seat itself was too hard not comfortable enough for a 12 hour flight. Also when you are in the position to sleep by sliding your seat you will have no space for your knees. The meals were just OK but entertainment was excellent. Each seat in Economy has got a power socket so you do not need to worry about battery on your mobile/laptop.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,2,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,9,D Phan,12th December 2012,4 segments starting at Washington Dulles to Tokyo Narita to Bangkok and return to Washington. In sum - an elegant business class.

ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,10,Harvey Weingarten,3rd December 2012,Because of bad weather in SFO our flight from PHL was delayed and caused us to miss our SIA flight 001 to HKG. We were re-routed to LAX for ANA 1005 to Tokyo-Haneda. What a pleasant surprise. Business class on 777. From the LAX service desk personal to the cabin staff it was a perfect travel experience. The food was 5 star quality and presentation. The angled lie flat were comfy using the down comforters and large pillows. I look forward to fly ANA in the future.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,10,Yuto Kotani,13th November 2012,I had a flight last year on the B777-300ER. No problem at check in because it was a connected flight from Port Columbus (CMH). I speak Japanese so I had no problem with that. Good in-flight meal although it could use a refresh. I had the ANA mileage club so my family was able to move our seats. Great in-flight entertainment good seats for economy class and really good service from the flight attendants. My return flight was bound for Chicago. Same things as my flight there.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,2,M Aikawa,7th November 2012,HND-HNL and sad to say the service has dropped off. Told the seat I had confirmed was no longer available at check in was told to ask at the gate. At the gate they gave me a sigh and said to ask the Attendants onboard. Once onboard the Chief Purser was polite but too busy telling her staff what to do and I eventually went to my middle seat. After the plane took off I asked again and another attendant told me it was not possible even though there was an open aisle seat a few rows in front of mines. Its unfortunate but I don't think I will fly ANA for a while.,,,Premium Economy,,,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,,2,no
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,8,P Tsumura,22nd October 2012,NRT-SFO-NRT two weeks back. Looking at some of the reviews already put up here - I have nothing new to add. The seats are very small makes sleep on long haul flights really impossible. But other than that I had a very pleasant flight both onward and return. The cabin crew always magically appeared next to me when I needed them and kept me happy by bringing me whatever I wanted to eat or drink. I watched 3 movies and chatted with my co-passengers with the latest seat to seat chat function! Would fly ANA again.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,5,J Akai,21st October 2012,JFK to Narita (B777-300). Excited to try the fixed back shell seats went in with an open mind but unfortunately I cant give it a good review. The food and service is unbeatable but in terms of seat comfort I still prefer the traditional seats that recline. The bottom of the seat slides forward and the back slides down at an angle within the shell seat but the head rest remains straight up. When the seat is reclined you lose substantial amount of leg room. My knees were touching the back of the seat in front when in full recline. The foot rest/massager is good but the novelty wears off quickly. I was able to fall asleep but woke up on a number of occasions due to not having enough cushion. ANA should follow Cathay Pacific and eliminate the shell seating on their 777s.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,3,no
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,8,E Cabilis,11th October 2012,Seattle to Manila via Narita on 777 on time. Aircraft clean including the toilet. Seat has a good pitch and inflight entertainment is good. The food has 2 choices Western and Japanese - both are only average. They serve a light snack consist of biscuits and mixed nuts which are good. The price paid for this flight is reasonable. The best thing about ANA is the cabin crew they are hardworking and the whole duration of the flight are serving drinks and attending the passenger needs to the point that the call button switch is not necessary. I would definitely fly with them again.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,3,C Nichols,9th October 2012,Just returned from Okinawa on ANA connecting through Narita. Domestic flight was okay. International flight to LAX a newly configured 777-300 was tough. The fixed back seat is the most uncomfortable seat - could not get comfortable for 10 hours. The food ranged from odd to not right. A word of advice when picking a western menu go with choices that capture a wider spectrum of the western palette. The service was okay however it took almost three hours for main cabin lights to be dimmed on an overnight flight. The inflight entertainment screens were nice. Best interactive flight tracker I have seen. Movie selection was lacking for the caliber of AVOD system ANA invested in.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,,3,no
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,9,Li Yunhao,9th September 2012,I flew HND-LAX last week on a 772. I had no opinion in the Value for Money because I was upgraded to biz class. The old-dated seats and entertainment systems in 772 need to be replaced. Flight crew are very nice though English is hard to understand sometimes.,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,2,K Snyder,9th September 2012,I recently flew on ANA Business Class from Narita to Chicago and was served my beef fillet uncooked (not even rare) and had to ask that it be cooked further. When we were served breakfast it wasn't even heated up cold omelette. Again we had to ask them to take it back and at least warm it. They warmed it to the minimum. Staff turns up the heat during flight (I assume to put everyone to sleep) as service is hard to come by in between meal service. Overall service and food needs to be improved to ensure quality service in all cabins. Service needs to be checked or aisles at least walked between meal services. Air temp. needs to be cooler. We were seated in business class. The seats are ok but still not comfortable when in flat bed mode. I would only take ANA again if I got a free ticket using miles.,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,1,no
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,3,M Cameto,13th August 2012,NRT-CDG. I have been a regular customer of ANA over the last 10 years (meaning bronze member most years). In recent years the overall quality is going down terribly. The worst is probably the new economy class seats used now on virtually all long haul flights that do not recline. Seats on long haul flights that do not recline. Try getting some rest in those seats if you're more than 175 cm tall. Second worst is mileage awards/accrual policy which terribly lags behind the competition in star alliance and elsewhere. Most tickets bought with ANA now only provide you with 50% actual miles accrual. Third is small size of portions (though nice food I must say). All in all ANA has gone down and I now prefer flying United to the US or Lufthansa to Europe. This is a shame because this used to be a really great company.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1,no
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,10,R Calvo,9th August 2012,Flew Seattle to Tokyo recently with ANA. The crew were the selling point of the trip. They never ran out of smiles and provided excellent inflight service. Tasty food and the best inflight fruit juice I've had on a plane.,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,3,Charles Nave,7th August 2012,Flew ANA return from Singapore to Tokyo in July 2012. Seats do not recline in economy however the bottom cushion shifts forward. For someone of average height this is probably fine however being over 6ft this just crushes my leg room so had to spend the entire midnight flight trying to sleep in a completely upright position. Secondly the meals were awful. I had the choice of a local meal and a 'western meal' of a hamburger covered in cheese with one small baby carrot. Finally the entertainment system was really not first class and offered little variety. Either way I will be paying a premium next time to fly with a better carrier.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1,no
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,8,Tony Banwait,1st August 2012,Manila to Narita in July 2012. Quite impressed with good attentive service by nice cabin crew. Choice of meals offered and free flowing beer or wine. Pleasant flight overall. Only annoyance I had was no one from economy was permitted to deplane until the entire business cabin was empty. This took at least ten minutes of us standing in the aisle and definitely caused some passenger to become irritated.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,9,S Medina,22nd July 2012,They were extremely helpful in putting us on an earlier flight to ensure we made our connection as well as retrieving our bags to ensure they made it to our destination with us. The cabin attendants were polite and gracious. Our seats were comfortable and roomy and made our 12 hour flight not just bearable but enjoyable. I would recommend for their professionalism and efficiency.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,8,B Chua,22nd July 2012,SIN-NRT-SIN. Service was excellent on both legs. Flight attendants were warm and prompt to attend to customers' needs. After meal time they went around frequently to offer water juice or tea to keep us hydrated for the flight. Inflight entertainment was alright. However some foreign movies didn't have English subtitles so English speaking customers are pretty much limited to Hollywood movies. Food served was pretty good. Instead of just verbally asking you for the meal option they provided a picture of the two options so it made the selection much easier. Customers know what to expect from the picture. I also like how Fiji mineral water bottles were given out during meal times. I would definitely fly with ANA again.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,8,C Kim,22nd July 2012,This was my second trip on ANA and similar to my previous experience I must say that the fixed economy seat is unbearable! Besides that I can't really find a reason to complain about this airline. I appreciate the little things such as the fiji water bottle the haagen daz ice cream complimentary post cards etc. Customer service is also another plus about this airline as everyone from the check in agent to the in-flight staff provide exceptional customer care. If not only for the uncomfortable seats I would not hesitate in wanting to fly with them again.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,10,Justin Ferido,16th July 2012,Flight on a 767-300 from Okinawa to Narita connecting to Honolulu (via United). Wonderful 2 hour flight. Flight attendants catered to my every need. Check in was crowded in the Economy line due to everybody leaving for summer break. Other than that it was a wonderful time. I can't say the same about the next flight on United.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,8,David Balladon,16th July 2012,I had never flown ANA before and was pleasantly surprised. I flew from Tokyo to Hong Kong I was actually due to fly with UA but they hired ANA for the flight. I was extremely relieved as UA are dreadful as I had taken them from Guam to Tokyo. ANA was a breath of fresh air. I flew business the seats were the new cradle seats very comfortable. Staff were friendly. There was on demand TV with new movies. They also give you a choice of 2 menus to choose from either Western or Asian. The strange thing is you can't mix and match the menus.,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,9,M Gleeson,9th July 2012,I was very impressed with ANA's latest service standard on a 777-300ER flight from Frankfurt to Tokyo-Narita. With the only exception of this aeroplane type being much noisier than usual near the back this was pretty much as good as any economy class service I have been in. The plane was in a 2-4-3 configuration which gives various group sizes more options than the standard aeroplane layouts. Despite some negative reviews that I have read the fixed shell seats were excellent and gave one all options for what to do on the flight - work or rest. With this type of seat and good legroom one is no longer at the mercy of the passenger in front. The seat design was as good as Singapore's A380's and had top-class in-flight entertainment including the best flight progress maps and data that I have seen. The reason for the flight not being a 10 is the noise.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,2,M Suehiro,9th July 2012,Flew ANA NH 916 from Bangkok to Narita. The check in process was horrible and the customer service agent didn't know how to switch my seats for me when I requested and instead tried to upgrade me into Business class. There was confusion as to whether I could get lounge access since I was booked in economy but I was showing status as a million mile flyer and a Star Gold. At the gate I was told that the cabin was fairly open and I could move to an open aisle seat. I asked for confirmation and an official change on the ticket but was assured it wouldn't be a problem. Once onboard the chief purser was polite but was obviously very distracted with her colleagues and wasn't able to assist me. When it looked like the majority of people had got onboard I asked the flight attendant if it was ok to change seats and was told it was not possible I would have to do it once we are airborne. When the seat belt light came off I attempted to move seats and was again told to take my original seats. For the price of the ticket and the fact I am a 100K mile flyer on the Star Alliance I was not only exasperated at how little flexibility and competence the flight attendants have to ensuring good customer satisfaction.,,,Premium Economy,,,,,,,,1,no
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,3,J Franklin,3rd July 2012,"6/20/12. Check in was polite and nice. English not too bad at check-in. It was very obvious that she was not comfortable speaking in English and she ""spoke"" more with sign language than words. Economy line was very long and there was no one to attend to the line. Mentioned I was a Star Alliance Gold member (United 1K) and asked which lounges can I go to. Was told I was in economy and not eligible. I reminded her Star Gold members can go ahead and access lounges and found the lounge on my own where I was welcomed. Inflight service was nothing special. Rather outdated compared to other airlines flying this same route. I asked the Flight Attendant a question on the US Customs Form and she didn't understand what I was asking so she brought the Purser and was told a completely different thing. The food was sub par and cold. For the price paid I am inclined to leave the Star Alliance and travel on Japan Airlines. They have a try harder spirit recently and it feels nice to be appreciated as a frequent flyer instead of being reminded of an economy class ticket. I often fly UAL but thought I would try ANA since I would get the same mileage accrue. For the price paid it was a disaster.",,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1,no
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,8,A Fisher,18th June 2012,My flight to Frankfurt and back from Haneda on the 787 was not quite a dream but it was quite nice. The service was especially good. And the washlets were a nice surprise. I doubt that US airlines will see the value in installing them. There was one problem though. I sat in the front row of the rear economy section both ways to enjoy the extra leg room However there are three toilets just in front of that section. And the doors automatically bang shut unless the user holds the door and closes it carefully. It was especially annoying during the lights dimmed sleep period.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,7,K Inouye,18th June 2012,LAX-NRT-LAX on a newly configured 777-300ER and NRT-OKA-NRT on a domestic configured 767-300. ANA has great service and their planes always feel brand new. I was excited to experience their new fixed-back economy seats on the 773ER. Plenty of legroom in the non-reclined position and I love the fact that they configure their 777-300ERs in a 2-4-3 configuration with a double armrest between the pair of four seats. It's also nice not having the person in front of you recline BUT the seats are impossible to sleep in. I won't be flying their Y class again. They're supposed to be introducing a new Prem Econ class soon will look into that next time around. Food was good and plentiful and their flight attendants are spot on. Flights on the domestic 767s were OK enough seat pitch to make a 2 1/2 hour flight bearable. Anything over that might start to get uncomfortable. ANA the fixed-back economy seats didn't work for Cathay and they're certainly not working for you.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,1,A Lim,7th June 2012,My flight from LA to Manila with a stopover in Narita (Tokyo) was extremely uncomfortable in spite of the better seat pitch. The ANA gate is on the extreme edge of the LAX a 10 minute walk from Bradley terminal. Then from the gate you'll have to get a bus - another 10 minutes - to another stand-alone gate structure out in the runway area to board. The cabin was very hot and the seats have no individual air conditioning control. Throughout the 11 hrs flight the florescent light overhead was left on at all times which made it difficult to nap or sleep. The transfer in Narita was also a nightmare. There was a long line to another security check plus another 10 minutes walk and 3 floors down to board the connecting flight to Manila. I've flown several airlines to cities in US Europe and Asia and this is by far the most uncomfortable flight experience I ever had.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1,no
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,8,C Jensen,30th May 2012,NRT-SGN return. New business class pod seats in the 767 are ok but certainly not as good as a lie-flat seat (which would be too much to expect on a 6-hour flight). Boarding was orderly. Food was good (I had the Japanese selections) as was the service. Flights in both directions left and arrived on time.,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,7,R Kwan,20th May 2012,SIN-NRT-LAX. The seats from SIN-NRT were very small almost unbearable for a 7 hour flight. Food was quite ok but one thing to note about ANA is that their service is excellent. The flight from NRT-LAX was a lot better with a bigger aircraft and much more legroom. Their seats do not really recline but slide forward something I didn't really mind with ample leg room on my NRT-LAX flight but was a huge problem for the smaller aircraft. Overall I guess you get what you pay for and it's quite an affordable choice. I think their flights to the US (and from) are the bigger planes so try to avoid ANA if you're flying within Asia I suppose. Otherwise recommended!,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,6,Christopher David,16th May 2012,I couldn't believe how small the seats were and I'm not a big guy. The food was pretty bad as most airline food is but this was beyond that. Plane was very clean and if I didn't have an exit row seat I would have jumped out of the plane. Staff was very attentive and efficient. As soon as I was notified I had a flight on ANA I registered as a frequent flyer and this is where you can choose your seats not through United where I booked my award flight.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,no
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,10,David Venton,24th April 2012,LHR-NRT 777-300ER. Very smooth and enjoyable flight inflight meals delicious and presentable. Flight attendants extremely pleasant and courteous throughout the 11 hour flight every request made was dealt with in a professional and courteous manner. Will definitely travel ANA again in September from LHR.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,7,P Dandoy,22nd April 2012,HKG-NRT return. If you are tall Y class is very small the seat does not recline it slides so you end up with your knees in the seat in front. Still very bearable for a 4 hour flight. The food is good and varied as an economy product. It beats business class fare of many western airlines! I have a gluten free meal which was very nice. The crew make you feel welcome. A little less public announcements which are inaudible anyway would be welcome indeed.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,7,C Kim,1st April 2012,Flew on the newly refurbished 777-300 from Los Angeles to Tokyo-Narita. Check-in was slow. Flight attendants were extremely helpful with my requests and remained consistent in their service. Two meals served and they were both good. The same cannot be said of the seats though as it was not possible to recline them but only have them slide forward which made sleeping impossible. I agree with other reviews with regards to inflight entertainment as it can feel redundant after a couple of hours. Great service and a good enough inflight product.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,8,Peter Goldsbury,29th March 2012,Hiroshima to Tokyo Haneda and back on the new Boeing 787. Premium Class was full and Economy Class was quite full. Both flights were quite smooth and inflight service which in Economy Class consisted of drinks served in paper cups was clinically efficient. Seats were somewhat hard and would have become uncomfortable on a longer flight. The inflight tracking and entertainment system was sophisticated but ANA have done away with the cameras showing take-off and landing.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,10,T Padilla,28th March 2012,Business class from San Francisco to Narita in early February. Ground staff were friendly and flight attendants were first rate and very attentive. I enjoyed the pod seats that went into flat beds and provided a level of privacy. The western food was very good. Flight attendants offered me a second meal. As a result I asked to let me rest until a particular hour and to be awoken to have the second meal. Inflight entertainment more than adequate.,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,10,C Dickens,26th March 2012,I missed my scheduled flight from Okinawa to Tokyo. Staff in Okinawa did everything to get me on another flight so I had a chance to meet my connecting flight. There was a woman waiting for me when I got off the plane and ran with me to the bus to take me to the international side of airport. Very quickly they had a ticket for the Tokyo flight and the rest of my connecting flights back to Orlando. I made it to the gate in time for my connecting flight. I could not have done this if it was not for all the help I got from ANA staff.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,9,Stephen Guerguy,25th March 2012,SFO-NRT-BKK return. Staff were very attentive constantly coming by with drinks hot towels at the beginning/end of the flight etc. Food was fantastic - Japanese option and American option. They served breakfast and dinner on legs from SFO-NRT return. Only complaint is that the seat didn't recline instead the seat portion slid forward.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,4,P Tracy,22nd March 2012,NRT-ORD March 2012 Boeing 773. ANA desperately needs to update their AVOD entertainment system. There is no excuse for airlines not to have the touch-screen system with larger screens. Still using the 1990s version where one channel = one movie. Plane was clean but didn't seem new.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1,no
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,9,R Shankar,22nd March 2012,TPE-NRT in Business. Flights on time the aircraft immaculate and the crew extremely efficient and friendly. Adding to this was the delicious inflight meal and green tea. An airline that knows how to take care of passengers.,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,8,L Ball,21st March 2012,Boeing 767 from Honolulu to Haneda. Flight attendants greeted almost every passenger and service was excellent. Choice of Japanese or Western meal. Flight attendants frequently offering hot hand towels juice and crackers. Inflight entertainment seemed very old-fashioned. Overall great food and service with excellent staff. My only problem was the inflight entertainment.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,,Jan Nattier,17th March 2012,Bangkok to Tokyo (Narita) on a flight that departed just before midnight stunned to find that none of the seats in Economy reclined! This was a 767-300 aircraft. Fight attendants seemed apologetic. No matter how affordable these seats are I do not recommend anyone take this flight unless he/she intends to stay awake and work all night sleeping the next day (without a connecting flight)!,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1,no
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,10,Mark Carter,28th February 2012,NRT-ORD F Class. Fantastic flight FA's very professional. Food drink and quality of seat all as they should be.,,,First Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,5,Jean-Baptiste Legrand,25th February 2012,SFO-NRT on B777-300. Upon boarding the cabin looked new and clean but the niceness ended there. ANA's new fixed-back economy seat was the most uncomfortable seat I have had the misfortune to sit in. The legroom was not great but once the seat slouched forward the legroom became non-existent. FAs were polite and had a permanent rather fake-looking smile plastered their faces the entire flight. The first meal service was tasty and filling. The second meal was Western and not very good. The seat-back PTVs were good-sized however the selection of entertainment mostly Japanese/East Asian.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1,no
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,4,A Tsai,4th February 2012,Nice service attitude affordable clean bathrooms and sometimes decent food. However the flight attendants have poor English language skills. I had to translate what they said to many other Americans during the flight. On another flight (Japan to Taiwan) flight attendants don't even speak Mandarin/Chinese which makes me wonder why because many Chinese people travel that flight route. The food varies each time. I had great in flight meals in early 2011 (April-June) but towards the end of 2011 the food got worse in quality. Hope they can improve in 2012. Their economy seats are uncomfortable. The seats do not recline at all do not recommend for long flights.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,no
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,10,R Gamba,27th January 2012,MNL-NRT-SFO in Business Class. Both flight segments were perfect. Service was second to none. Flight attendants were friendly and helpful. Food offering in the lounge and onboard were amazing. Planes were clean. Love the new staggered configuration on the NRT-SFO segment especially the small cabin between the first class and the main business class cabin. The sleepwear provided made for a comfortable sleep.,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,9,K Suzuki,26th January 2012,Washington DC-Tokyo frequent flyer. I usually fly business class but I booked Premium Economy. Service and meals are always excellent (meals not so good in economy class). I wish Washington DC got the same equipment as New York. The new business class staggered looks so much better.,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,8,T Orr,24th January 2012,MUC-NRT in Economy as part of a Star Alliance RTW. Managed to get an exit row window plenty of legroom and able to get a decent night's sleep. Good selection of English and Japanese programmes on IFE. Food unimpressive but edible and selection of drinks was more than adequate. Service impeccable - FAs were lovely helpful and quick to respond to requests. Nearly an hour late leaving MUC due to traffic and de-icing but we were kept well-informed and still landed at NRT on time. Will use ANA again.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,9,P Micallef,21st January 2012,SFO to Narita onward to Manila in the new business class cabin. I was impressed at the high levels of service. The food was good and plentiful. Entertainment options on AVOD could be better though I did find things to watch. Amenities were made available in the bathrooms no individual amenity kit given out in business but you get a pair of slippers. It was the first time with ANA and will not be the last they have an excellent product fine service and efficient.,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,9,Paul Devinsky,18th January 2012,Wonderful customer service flying from Washington Dulles to Narita yesterday. I arrived late to Dulles airport - about 35 or 40 minutes prior to the scheduled departure and after the computer closed the flight. One of the ground crew called to the gate - had the flight reopened checked me in and escorted me through security to the gate and right to my seat! Every few minutes he alerted the gate crew of our progress and exact location by walkie talkie.,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,7,B Cheng,17th January 2012,Bangkok-Narita-San Francisco. Inflight service excellent on both sectors with a good selection of food. Narita- San Francisco had the new staggered layout which is very comfortable. However the transfer at Narita was terrible. Only two out of the three security stations were staffed. Stood in line waiting to go through the transfer security check for over 45 minutes. By the time I was through security the San Francisco flight was already boarding and I was unable to use the lounge. With ANA adding more international flights out of Narita I can imagine that this is only going to get worse.,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,9,B Orana,11th January 2012,Singapore to New York City. The seats are designed to recline without moving the piece in front of the person behind you also making mealtimes easier. I usually travel Singapore Airlines but I am forced to conclude this was better. The only downsides were the entertainment being all in Japanese except for a few romantic comedies and the limited speciality meal selection. Unless you like real Japanese food avoid this. Staff were fantastic. The price was excellent given that it was their standard and being part of Star Alliance I was able to collect all the miles on my Krisflyer card.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,10,A Huynh,12th December 2011,NRT-SGN. Flight departed a little late but we arrived on time in Vietnam. Flight staff were very friendly and food was excellent. The aircraft was clean and seats we comfortable. I would definitely flight ANA again.,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,5,V Singh,2nd December 2011,"NRT to IAD. Excellent service great on-demand entertainment. Exceptionally small economy seats. According to Seatguru the seats are 2"" thinner than most airlines and you can definitely feel it. For such long flights I suggest choosing SQ or UA instead of ANA.",,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1,no
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,9,Ron Kuhlmann,28th November 2011,SFO-NRT-MNL in Y. Nice B773 attentive crew and service. The meals were not especially pretty to look at but were tasty and far more rewarding than their appearance. Seat comfort was ok but less so than United's Economy Plus. Overall a pleasant experience and would recommend ANA to others.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,9,Nicolas Pelisch,16th November 2011,LAX-HND return. Flight attendants were kind and helpful. Plane was clean and in excellent condition (777-200ER). Requested a low salt meal which was delicious including snacks. Seats in economy premium were pretty wide comfortable with the addition of noise cancelling headphone to use. Very satisfied with both flights.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,9,L Huang,10th October 2011,IAD-NRT-HKG. Service was impeccable. FA in charge of our section introduced herself by name prior to take-off. Also offered me sweater to wear during the flight. Love the blankets they offer. Food offerings very good especially if you are a seafood lover. The seats are not as comfortable as I remember them - not lie-flat at all and a bit bumpy / hard. Movie options also not that good.,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,10,R Shankar,13th September 2011,HND-OKA-HND. Both flights were great spotless aircraft's clean toilets and regular drink services. The flights were full but the crew went out of there way to relocate me to a spare row for some extra comfort. I often fly ANA for business trips within Japan. I am always impressed at the high levels of service.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,10,Bill Hansen,13th September 2011,Tokyo-Honolulu Economy return with Air Japan crew. Excellent service and great experience from online booking to landing in Tokyo on the return. Excellent work and attitude by flight attendants advance notice by email about 1 hr flight delay on the return. Food was impressive for Economy Class - both in terms of menu choices and quality of preparation.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,8,R Wiegmann,15th August 2011,FRA-NRT on the new 777 Business Class. HND-LAX sitting in the former Business Class. On both routes the catering was excellent compared to other airlines flying that route. It both looked and tasted great. Crew were efficient yet not overly friendly. New Business Class is nice with a lot of personal room. The seat is a little narrow and I always touched the tray while turning around in my lie flat. 2nd leg was old style Business Class with non lie flat but comfortable enough to sleep for 7 hrs on the HND-LAX leg.,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,9,A Scafani,31st July 2011,New York-Tokyo B777. Plenty of leg room good food clean facilities courteous FA's good movies and games. I switched from JAL because of the little ANA extras like an I-pod jack at every seat (even economy). Sufficient legroom but only one flight per day.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,9,S Yamamoto,20th July 2011,"ORD-NRT C Class. FA's would go out of their way to cater to requests and the needs of passengers. It's not too often that you would hear a ""sorry no"" from them. And if the answer happened to be a ""sorry but no."" it would be followed by ""however perhaps we can do this..."" and would be followed by an alternative solution. The seat while not fully flat was comfortable enough for the Transpacific flight and decent entertainment options on the AVOD. Lavatories were frequently cleaned by the FA's and fairly decent sets of amenities were made available to C Class passengers. Second (or third) meal service anytime by request is great since you can eat at your own timing. Lobster Curry was tasty. Excellent ground staff service both at ORD and NRT.",,,Business Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,10,Frank Mauz,25th June 2011,CTS-HND on B747. Have never been on a plane with so many people. Friendly stewardess told me we were 565 passengers. In spite of that economy seat was roomy enough boarding was efficient there was an inflight drink flight on time and luggage arrived quickly.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,7,H Tam,25th June 2011,KIX to ICN on A320 Economy Class. Knowing that it is only a very short flight I didn't expect much for the inflight service. Out of my expectation I enjoyed an excellent inflight service given it is a four-star airline. Playing cards postcards and writing kits were available on request. Gifts were proactively given to young travellers by cabin crew. The crew were very friendly and helpful. The ANA special drink which claimed to be made from Kyushu orange was pretty good. However a fast decent meal instead of just a snack will be better. ANA's service might not be comparable to those of SQ but definitely comparable and even better than some 5-star airlines. They are close to 5-star status.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,8,D Mauro,23rd June 2011,NRT-SIN-NRT-ORD. Flights between NRT-SIN were just ok. The 767 was the most cramped aircraft I've ever been on and the food was mediocre. The legroom was so poor that my knees hit the seat in front of me when I reclined (and I'm not all that tall). The flight from NRT-ORD was excellent though. There was plenty of legroom on the 777 food was delicious and plentiful and nothing was too much trouble for the FAs. All flights did have excellent video-on-demand entertainment. Overall ANA is a little bit inconsistent but much better than any U.S. carrier. I would fly them again.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,7,P Neustadt,8th June 2011,"IAD-NRT-IAD in First both aircraft were equipped with the old ""new"" product. Leaves a lot to be desired. There's basically no at-seat storage. I like that it's so easy to move the tray out of the way while you're eating though. Bed was a very thin mattress pad to put over the seat with a duvet on top. I had the Kaiseki meal and it was very good. Flight attendants very good and spoke English but their accent was so thick that it was very hard to understand them.",,,First Class,,,,,,,,1,no
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,9,V Blaxell,7th June 2011,PEK-KIX great legroom but seats and IFE on this 737-700 were not anything to write home about though good enough for this 3 hour leg. The cabin was in impeccable condition and service was quiet attentive and polite. Superb Japanese lunch with a fine choice of wines sakes and shochus.,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,5,Masaki Oda,2nd May 2011,"NRT-SIN on Economy. Rebooked by SQ as my original SQ flight had been delayed and thus would likely miss my connection in Singapore. B767-300ER not new it was well maintained. The inflight service was decent and for those who flies on ANA only may satisfied with it. As I usually fly on SQ on NRT-SIN during the same time of the day there was a significant difference in inflight service. While SQ serves a lunch and a snack on 7 hour service ANA serves a lunch only. In addition SQ gives ice-cream for free ANA charges 350 yen as ""ANA Selection"". As ANA tickets to SIN sold in Japan are relatively more expensive than those of SQ I would choose SQ in the future.",,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,9,Dang Pham,1st May 2011,Tokyo to Chicago B777-300 Business Cradle Seat 7G. The seat is comfortable in relaxing position and sleeping position but it isn't 180 degree flat. No amenities kit only a sweater. The blanket is well designed and pillow is one of the best. Food and drinks excellent and choice of Japanese and Western menus. Of course Japanese menu much better. IFE choice are not very extensive but still okay. Restrooms are clean but amenities limited. Flight attendants are courteous efficient and asking if you need something.,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,4,yes

ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,6,C Chua,29th March 2011,NRT-MNL and back. Airline interiors seats carpet blankets were clean. Seats were a bit stiff though. Toilets were well-stocked and well-maintained. Cabin crew though appeared distant were accommodating and attentive. Some announcements made in perfect Tagalog which was pleasant to hear. Airline offers the latest magazine issues of famous titles in English and Japanese. Big disappointment was the food. The presentation looked very nice with the glass plates and delectable. But the main course was too sweet and too tangy. Good thing the appetizers were better.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,8,E van der Does,13th February 2011,New Boeing 777-300ER clean with a lot of legroom (seatback doesn't move back but the seat slides forward). Attendants very polite and courteous with good English skills. Dinner a choice between a Japanese or Western meal - Japanese meal seemed small but was filling. Frequent drink runs. Big personal entertainment touch screens with an OK selection of movies but didn't watch much because I managed to sleep for a couple of hours. No choice for breakfast - a combination between Western and Japanese food again it seemed small but was filling.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes

ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,8,Y Arokoyo,30th January 2011,JFK-NRT Boeing 777-300ER. I love ANA seat configuration in Economy - 3x4x2 which I think is clever accommodating a sort of lovers’ lane with 2 on the side and the others which remain standard. Seats are pretty comfy with decent legroom (34ins seat pitch) and footrests. Inflight entertainment is good with large LCD touch-panel PTV and a variety of on-demand entertainment options - though not the best I've seen - and Universal PC power port and USB connections. The food was delicious and portions satisfying. There are a couple choices - western or Japanese. One criticism there's no mid-journey snack and ANA has a for purchase menu where you can purchase light meals. I find this a tad odd for a 14hr nonstop flight. Standard pre-arrival light meal service offered.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,6,A Hans,28th January 2011,LHR-NRT-LHR. Staff were helpful on outward journey always around to to help. At the inbound it wasn't the case. They looked tired lacking of sleep and seem to disappear for prolonged periods! Food excellent for special meal. The rest no different than other airlines and short of JAL. Online booking facility a bit outdated. Seat selection facility in flash always crashing. The worst with ANA there is no area to leave feedback online no proper call centre with extended hours. Basically if you miss 17:30 you are stuffed. I find it very absurd especially that they operate in other countries with different time zones to be able to offer 24h telephone support! If you encounter problems paying online then there is no other way to pay via phone. If you are impatient please look for other airlines.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1,no
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,9,Tom Obokata,9th January 2011,LHR-NRT-LHR. Business class fitted with the new seating which reclines 180 degrees able to sleep comfortably without sliding down. IFE decent with a mixture of western and Japanese movies and programmes. The standard of meals including snacks and drinks was higher than some airlines although service was slower than it used to be. The downside of my outbound journey was that my luggage was stuck in LHR for 2 days and I had no access to my belongings for a few days. However I was paid £150 as a compensation which allowed me to buy a few necessities.,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,3,Luis Merizalde,7th January 2011,"LAX-NRT Business. Totally disappointed. When boarding in LAX I requested a glass of water that was delivered to me 1 hour into flight. when complained was told that USA security regulations forbid serving liquids on ground. This was confirmed by the business class purser! Food very good flight attendants smiling but did not have any English skills. Ordered Champagne and white wine comes. Order white wine red comes. Seats very old and worn out and uncomfortable. When talking to the chief purser she answers ""this is ANA!"". No amenity kit for a 12 hour flight ! A typical lack of consistence of the star alliance!",,,Business Class,,,,,,,,1,no
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,9,K Chun,22nd October 2010,Tokyo Haneda to Hong Kong inflight service excellent polite crew great food for economy. I fell asleep before landing crew collected my headset and retracted my footrest without waking me! There are free rental mobile phone for (pay-as-you-go) in Japan and they let me know my cell number before hand. Reason for not having perfect score was I arrived at the airport early and they refused to check-in my bags while ANA counter was open (for another flight).,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,8,A Theseira,30th September 2010,SIN-NRT-LAX vv everything went well. I was personally escorted from gate to gate without having to run in Narita. The ground staff were efficient and very polite. The service onboard was excellent - meal portions huge and seat space comfortable. The Japanses Bento box meals were delicious. While their PTV was limited its better to have something to watch than nothing at all. Toilets on board were kept very clean.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,4,H MacDonald,21st August 2010,Return trip from Tokyo to London and first experience of ANA's new in-flight service offering. In-flight service was extremely poor with unappetizing food and audio-video entertainment selection very limited when compared to that of competing carriers. In flight cuisine was limited with offerings such as hot-dogs and plates of ham. Despite the poor service and product now offered ANA charge an unjustified premium over other airlines. In future I will certainly be looking at other carriers.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1,no
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,8,Justin Young,9th August 2010,LHR-NRT-LHR. We were travelling with a baby and ground and cabin staff were accomodating and caring. Great thing about ANA is that your buggy is put in a large plastic bag and taken to the hold at the door. It is brought up at the door at the other end so no lugging a heavy baby plus handluggage through the airport. Sitting at bulkhead with bassinet plenty of leg room. Entertainment on demand and a wide selection of international movies. Cabin crew warm and friendly. Baby meal and child's meal served first. Child's meal nutritous and excellent. Our food was delicious from NRT okay from LHR but odd breakfast of piece of ham and cheese (I pinched some of my daughter's more substantial child's meal). Service method is strange to say the least and rather slow - 3 hours to complete and no one wants to sit with a dirty tray in front of them for an hour waiting for tea. Also switch lights on about 4 hours before landing which is excessive for those that want to rest more. Eyemasks and earplugs are provided on demand as are toothbrushes and paste but this is not really advertised. Interior of the aircraft spotless and toilets remained so throughout entire flight.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,8,Walter Bertschinger,7th August 2010,Honolulu - Tokyo - Singapore: On the first leg to Tokyo the service food inflight entertainment etc was excellent - a little less impressive on the way to Singapore. The legroom is sufficient only for average sized Japanese; head rests are way too low for tall people remain partly behind the back and make things rather uncomfortable. Average sized Westerners should not use Economy class on ANA.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,7,R Fernandez,31st July 2010,SFO-NRT-SFO heard good reviews of ANA but was disappointed. The first meal (lunch) we got from SFO to NRT was typical Japanese meal which was good. They did not offer any snacks in between meals. Just water and tea. Second meal was chimichangas (the kind you get from Costco). I could not believe they would serve Mexican fast food in a Japanese airline! On the trip back NRT to SFO the first meal was good typical Japanese meal. The second meal (breakfast) was a hamburger which was awful. Again no snacks offered in between meals just tea and water. Service good and staff were friendly enough. I would not use this airline again.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1,no
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,9,Brian Smith,11th July 2010,NRT-HKG-NRT in economy. Check-in efficient on both ends service onboard faultless food not bad and seat pitch decent especially on the 767 on return from HKG. I had vegetarian meals both ways and from Tokyo was rather gourmet and interesting but the one catered by Cathay was uninspired. The only bad point of the ANA flights is the entertainment system. The movies are few and old and I was glad I wasn't on a long-haul. Tried booking Delta on this same routing and days and was quoted double the price of what I paid on ANA. ANA website was easy to use.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,9,K Ong,2nd July 2010,SFO-NRT B777-300ER flight from SFO was on-time and was upgraded to Business Class due to overbooking in the economy cabin. A good airline with clean cabins and pleasant FAs food was as good as a typical Japanese restaurant. Able to sleep due to the inclined flat-bed.,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,9,N Kano,20th June 2010,HNL-NRT round trip economy. Outbound flight to NRT was delayed due to mechanical problems. My travel plans were flexible and I didn't want to wait at the HNL airport for the problem to be fixed and received excellent service from ANA ground staff who assisted me with getting on the next day's flight to NRT. The inflight service from the FAs was great on both the outbound and return. Very good quality meals and plenty of drinks served with FAs coming by with drinks throughout the flight.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,6,Tony Edwards,18th June 2010,NRT-LHR return. Seat 23D which looks appealing due to being a mini cabin had substantially less leg room. Couldn't straighten my legs and was in pain when getting off the aircraft. Food was average for lunch and poor for the second meal with a disgusting hotdog on outbound and some dodgy sliced meat on return. Return was again delayed this time due to servicing issues at LHR. Left me with short time for connection at NRT. Guess what again delayed both on take off and then delayed for another 40 minutes. Cabin crew polite and friendly as normal for Japanese airline. Not great value for money considering there seems to be a premium for flying with a Japanese airline out of NRT when compared to other Asian airports.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,,A Moon,10th June 2010,ANA failed to alert passengers about its cancelled flight ORD-Narita on June 2nd even though they knew 14 hours in advance that the plane never left Narita. The Passenger Reps couldn't be bothered to check other flight availability. Only after being prodded did they miraculously found a seat on United Airlines departing within 2 hours of its cancelled flight. I understand that technical issues are unavoidable but the total lack of accountability about the customer experience was shocking! ANA was previously known for its customer service (that we expect from Japanese airlines) but don't be fooled. I found ANA employees to be unprofessional at best rude at worst.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1,no
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,10,Frank Mauz,9th June 2010,NRT-HNL in Economy B777. Fast check-in efficient friendly cabin attendants delicious meals wide variety of entertainment frequent water and green tea offerings spotless lavatories.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,5,M Ballestro,31st May 2010,We paid about $2400 each for a nonstop Premium Economy ticket from IAD to NRT because the thought of cramped quarters in Economy for 14 hours to NRT and 12 hours back to IAD put us off. While I cannot complain about the quality and comfort of the seats - we had footrests seat width was spacious decent amount of pitch nice armrests so both you and the person next to you both had plenty of elbow room - the service was not that great. On the way to Narita we were served shortly after being airborne but it was 9.5 hours before we were offered any sort of food again. Sure the flight attendants would come by offering green tea or coffee but not even a lousy bag of pretzels? The same thing happened on the way back - fortunately we brought snacks with us so we were more prepared but it was still uncomfortable. If I'm paying twice the price of the economy ticket (which Premium was in this case) you would think we would have received at least a few more snacks than Economy. It was an uncomfortable experience. I doubt if we would fly ANA again because of it.,,,Premium Economy,,,,,,,,1,no
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,5,Anthony Leith,24th May 2010,NRT-SFO-NRT Business class on B777-300. Lounge in Narita excellent. Onboard service is a little lacking. No pre-take off drinks served on ANA unlike other business class offerings elsewhere. When leveled out still no drinks were offered just a complimentary 'Kool-Aid' type of plum drink given out. Had to wait until the dinner ordering to get a beer. Food was great however the breakfast offering into SFO was poor for business class - a couple of muffins and poor tasting coffee. Food on the return and all-daylight flight was much better. Seat great but being tall not as comfortable as Asiana's flat beds. Also the bulkhead in business class found me touching with my feet whilst trying to sleep - annoying. Didn't bother sleeping on the return flight. Given the Business Class fare was a good deal the service wasn't bad but sure wasn't anything to get excited about. ANA need to lift their game in my opinion. In my answer 3 below its a recommendation in regards to competing airlines on the route not against other airlines. ANA are the best of a fairly average lot to the USA from Japan.,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,9,H Lee,26th March 2010,IAD-NRT-IAD. The food was excellent (kaiseki course) and FAs were quick on snack requests at any time during the flight. The sake was good! The seat was comfortable and I had no problems. The business lounge in IAD could have more refreshments but still better than US airline lounges. In fact ANA has one of the best customer service which North American airlines can never hope to match.,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,,James King,12th March 2010,Haneda-Hong Kong-Haneda. Fast talking agents resulted in penalties which were more than the price of the economy class ticket even though I spent 4 times that to upgrade the tickets to business class using cash not miles. ANA C-class seats and AVOD are getting dated - pitch is much poorer than UA Cathay or Asiana. Cabin service was technically perfect but lacking sincerity. AVOD was spotty partner's AVOD did not work on the return flight. Indifferent attitude from the FAs. For the price paid almost any other airline is better in my own opinion even if you have to transfer in Incheon. On the positive side ground crew check- in gate staff were excellent. Unfortunately the reservations team and the FAs need to return to what made ANA a star in the alliance.,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,1,no
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,8,Horst Moeller,26th January 2010,Flight in Business Class from BKK-NRT-ORD. Sleeper seats uncomfortable difficult to sleep because of sliding down seat constantly. Food selection satisfactory but nothing to be excited about. No breakfast before landing on both flights. Aircraft B777-200 was very clean and service was friendly and efficient.,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,1,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,8,Saurabh Kumar,19th January 2010,Haneda-Tottori-Haneda. Superb although large airport. Spotless aircraft and immaculate service by way of friendly English speaking FA.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,10,R Paterson,14th January 2010,NRT-JFK on a spotless modern B777. All around 10/10. Crew were friendly more than willing to accommodate. Food was above average constant attention from FAs with drink service. AVOD helped pass the time quite well with a lot of selections. Certainly loads better than the United flight I took going to Japan. Would definitely use ANA again for any travel to/from Japan.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,10,T Bissell,10th January 2010,I'm quite pleased that ANA is part of the Star Alliance. I've never had anything but superb service from each and every ANA employee. They've even gone so far as to grab my bag and run with me in the airport in order to ensure that my overly-tight connection (due to weather) didn't leave stranded (NRT to NGS in May 2009). The ANA reps will work with you if your Japanese isn't up to par and I've never had a single problem with flying them over the past 10 years.,,,Premium Economy,,,,,,,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,9,Alan Wan,10th January 2010,LHR to NRT : I was impressed the service was similar standards to SIA. Attentive friendly and with the important small touches like hot towels. Dinner one of the best economy meals I have had in a long time - I was not in a mood to drink alcohol so canot comment on the choice or quality. I slept for most of the flight and the IFE (although a decent system) choice of films was rather limited.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,8,John Powalisz,7th January 2010,"ORD-NRT Business. The cabin is neat and clean and the service far surpasses anything that the US flagged carriers offer for International travel. The business seats have their plusses and minuses. It is very hard for a 6' person and above to get comfortable sleeping on the ""slope"". The padding is very thin so sitting or sleeping is a bit rough. AVOD system is excellent and includes noise cancelling head phones. Once you get used to the ""A la Carte"" style service ANA offers meal and beverage service is fantastic. Food was good and plentiful. The biggest advantage of the service is the attitude. The flight attendants really made you feel welcome unlike anything the US majors have to offer. One heads up would be about the use of the Red Carpet lounge; They do not offer ANA Business customers free internet. This is an outrage based on the fare I paid but so be it. The attitude of the UAL attendant in the lounge was typical; poor and she blamed the situation on ANA and how cheap they are.",,,Business Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,10,Quek Keng Guan,17th November 2009,SIN-NRT-SIN in Y class. Bought their promotion fare for S$482 including taxes /adult while S$52 including taxes for infant ticket. Travelled on their new 767-300 on their special livery (Panda) seated in row 15C D and E behind J class on both sectors. This section is quieter as there are a few rows of seats compared to the main section of the Y class. Seats are comfortable with ample recline. PTV has more than 160 programmes/games etc. However there were only 5-6 children programmes and average duration is only 30 mins. Food selection excellent. Each tray has a water bottle on it Haagen daaz ice cream given on both sectors 2 hrs before landing. FA on both sectors especially the return sector were extremely attentive to families with children. Hot towels were given before meals only on the Sin-Nrt sector. Check in at Nrt excellent ANA staff personally guided us for check in as I'm travelling with 2 kids. ANA is an excellent product for travellers with families and will not hesitate to travel with them again.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,6,Michael Scott,29th October 2009,"LHR-NRT-LHR round trip in economy. Every aspect of service excellent from check-in to disembarking. The cabin crew worked hard to meet passenger wishes and gave the impression that nothing was too much trouble. But the seating is dreadful. They were the most uncomfortable seats with the smallest pitch I can remember on a long-haul flight. My knees were firmly up against the seat in front and had I not been able to move to an empty exit row seat on each flight then the flights would have been unbearable. For this reason alone I would not fly with ANA again nor recommend them to anyone over 5'6"" tall.",,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,no
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,9,T Patrick,21st October 2009,Hong Kong - Tokyo Haneda Economy. The service is excellent and fast. Dont expect to sleep on late flight to Haneda - lights on all trip. Good movie selection but not clear what channels are what. Seats rather thin leg room standard. Nothing to do at Haneda so dont rush there; also early arrivals to Haneda dont link with hotel bus services. Airport seemed to close as our flight left at 8pm!,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,8,Alexander Gan,18th October 2009,Singapore-Tokyo-Sapporo return. First flown on a B767 with special livery then on an A320 and back on a B737 and B767. On the first and last flight we sat behind business class. The seating was okay  inflight entertainment was good and food was delicious! The magazines are in Japanese and English.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,9,R Wong,2nd September 2009,Hong Kong to Tokyo Narita fairly new B777. I sat on row 23 in economy class. Row 21-23 in ANA 777 are separated from the main economy section so the cabin was quiet. Meal good above average. Wide range of movie selection. Cabin crew attentive and polite. Generally very good and comfortable flight.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,5,Y Kwon,1st September 2009,SFO-NRT B777-200 return in economy class. Perfect service excellent food. very clean. Everything was perfect except seat pitch length very uncomfortable. Best service I've ever had but worst seat comfort I've ever had in this round trip.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,9,J Billet,29th August 2009,FRA-NRT. Seat next to me was empty which added to the sense of comfort. FA's smiling and attentive. Toilets kept clean throughout the flight. Fish meal was delicious the red wines (I tried both) were so-so (lacking flavour and body) and bread was below ANA's usual standards (no whole wheat etc). Strange to be served such poor bread on a flight originating from Germany. Seat was good enough but not up to the full flat seats one finds on other airlines. I understand that tall people would have trouble getting a good sleep on such a seat. Maybe ANA can improve the boarding process in FRA? (One single boarding gate).,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,9,Brian Smith,20th August 2009,NRT-LAX-NRT in Business. Flight attendants friendly and extremely attentive seats not ideal but better than economy. Very difficult to sleep in any position except on your back (not lie flat seats). AVOD is limited. Food is always outstanding out of Narita. The menu you'll get for the Japanese meals is kaiseiki and would cost at least 6-7000 yen if eaten out on the town. However when returning to Japan from abroad the Japanese meals are less than stellar and are inadequate to the level of quality from NRT. They have been offering discounted business class fares that make this a very good value for money. Flew domestic US first class and it just cannot be compared to what you get on ANA business. The lounge in LAX is refurbished and as good as the lounge at NRT. Truly a joy to fly them. The long haul experience with them helps make the travel as painless as possible.,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,9,L Huang,13th August 2009,"IAD-NRT-HKG. FAs had smiles on their faces whatever you wanted they would get it with no attitude. Seats comfy - pillow and blanket in Biz class were very comfy. Slippers were nice too. Movie selection not that great - they need to include English subtitles in more Japanese movies / shows so more can enjoy. Food was quite good - seafood / sushi was fresh. The seats could be longer - I'm only 5'4"" and my legs hung out at the bottom past the foot rest. Not sure how ""average"" height people or taller handle it.",,,Business Class,,,,,,,,1,yes
ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,9,J Billet,7th August 2009,NRT-CDG Business cabin. Up to ANA standards when it comes to FA politeness and devotion to passenger service. Plane (B747) was very clean including the toilets throughout the flight. Seat was angled-flat but adequate to sleep. Inflight entertainment (VOD) was exhaustive in its offering (even though the channel guide catalog is somewhat hard to understand). Food was nice but odd in terms of offering. Appetizer and main course were delicious even though portions were slightly small. What surprised me the most was that ANA changed its policy (I was told by a FA) and the 2nd meal normally served two hours before landing had been discontinued and replaced by the (quite basic) light meal offering offered throughout the flight (sandwich pizza etc).,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
