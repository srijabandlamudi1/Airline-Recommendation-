"""still a good and safe airline""",7,E Gartner,21st November 2021,"✅ Trip Verified |  
FRA to JFK, still a good and safe airline but massive cut downs and not perfect any more.  On the first leg one one hand a very nice and helpful crew which was on the other hand not very visible for customers in a very empty plane, only when you asked for something the helped you, then however very friendly. No welcome drink, No amenity kit provided, on both legs. No menus. The flight attendant explained they had only lamb stew or pork belly to offer for dinner. I can eat lamb and I did, but I know many people do not like lamb neither would eat pork; the meal was oK, but definitely not Business Class quality. No vegetarian option. Same thing on the flight back JFK to FRA, only 2 options. On the flight back the crew was more visible. The seats in Business Class are not so comfy as expected but still very good giving you a lot of privacy compared with Lufthansa Business Class.

"""reduce both the level and quality of service""",1,Clare Barnaby-Smith,17th October 2021,"✅ Trip Verified |  I fear for the future of airline travel when airlines appear to use the excuse of covid19 to reduce both the level and quality of service, especially for an airline previously renowned for its 1st class operation like Singapore Airlines. I was bitterly disappointed in my recent flying experience with them; from poor quality food to reduced service levels. The crew was still wonderful, but that can't make up for the overall feeling I was left with. Forget your business class comfort pack (in my view, covid19 is not a reasonable excuse for why this has been dropped), you now need to take your own eye patches/earplugs to be able to sleep if you are prone to light/sound. Instead, you'll receive a covid19 kit so you can clean your own cabin area. Meals were of such poor quality that I wished I had brought my own sandwiches. No menus are available so you have to try and listen to rather badly-pronounced meal choices to make your selection. I chose chicken and rice which turned out to be bland and gristly, with practically uncooked chicken skin (see photos). Apparently, the different meal choice of the passenger to my left did not go down well as they also left theirs untouched. My breakfast choice; scrambled eggs and sausage were served practically cold. Excessive amounts of plastic being used in meal preparation is also very disappointing in a world trying on the whole to reduce plastic. This is hands-down the worst experience in business class that I have ever experienced and was compounded by the overly-officious ground staff yelling at us (in hazmat-like suits) to walk in single file as we were marched to a 'holding area' rather than a business class lounge. In this holding area, not even water was on offer. Other lines of passengers transiting on different flights were ordered to stand against the wall whilst our group passed by. My very strong advice, whilst covid19 continues to plague travel, is don't transit through Singapore or use Singapore Airlines.

"""the change would cost 490 USD""",2,S Hanowsky,14th October 2021,"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked a round-trip ticket on Singapore Airlines. The company touted customers' ability to change their flights for free, even being able to change a flight for free and having one free change after September 30, which would allow them to delay their flight well into 2022. I was able to easily change the flight until mid-September. After that point, I wasn't allowed to change it online and needed to call in which required over 1 hour of waiting. In September I could have changed my return flight to far into the future. In fact, the return leg of my flight was 2 months and 1 day after the initial flight. When I called in to push my flight date back, the customer service agent said I must upgrade my flight to rebook and that there was a minimum required stay of 2 months, meaning I couldn't have a the return leg of the flight more than two months after the initial one. First of all, my return flight was already more than 2 months later and before they restricted online flight changes, I could have changed my flight to much later dates.  The agent also told me the flight change would cost over 900 USD, more than the original round-trip ticket. I requested to speak to a manager. She denied my request and said she would talk to her team. After 30 minutes of being on hold, she said I could book my flight a maximum of one month past the current return date. This was not part of the agreement when I originally booked the flight. Now, however, I didn't need to upgrade the flight for some reason, but the change would cost 490 USD. Booking a one-way ticket at that time cost 497 USD. The agent explained that the difference was in the price of the flight. Nothing she said made sense.

No menus handed out, no Book the Cook online order of meals offered. The meals on offer were basically Economy meals served on China instead of plastic. The flight attendant was not able to tell me what types of wine were available. She even tried to convince me that a Chablis is a red wine. Everything was served on one tray. All those service shortcomings were explained as ""hygienic precautions"". The seat is very wide, but it’s hard to find a comfy seating position, and padding was insufficient. What really made me upset was the all nigh chit-chatting of the staff in the pantry. I know it was a long empty night flight, but please do not rob me of my sleep. This was not the first time I’ve experienced this on SQ. Transfer in Changi was chaotic, with passengers of each connecting flight being herded in long lines (nobody cared about social distancing here) before being escorted to their next flight. I’ve been on a long haul Qatar Airways flight a couple of weeks ago, and there was no compromise in services, and the staff was disciplined as always during the night flight.

Both flights were very empty, which added to the comfort level - I had an entire row to myself, and most rows around me were empty too. Nonetheless, it would have still been comfortable even if full - seats were spacious, with excellent legroom, and plenty of storage space in the seatback. The IFE was good - a varied selection of movies and TV shows, and the screen was large and high quality. Meals were all good - in particular the fried carrot cake was one of the best economy class meals I've eaten! My only gripe would be that there was no alcohol service beyond what came with the meals: usually they would do a drinks run before meals, and then offer top-ups during the meal service. This time the only drinks were offered with the meal. I suspect this may be due to Covid-19, in order to minimise interaction: it wasn't a problem, as crew were always responsive to my requests. What really made the flight were the crew: they were so friendly, attentive, warm and welcoming. This must be a difficult time for them to work, yet they were all wonderful.

A few weeks in advance they changed several of my upcoming itineraries out of the blue with no offer of refund or compensation. One of the changed itineraries is a big change and really messed up my travel plans. First of all, I paid for a specific itinerary and they just decide to change it to an inferior itinerary. Secondly, I have a non-refundable domestic flight (not SIA) that I can no longer use with the new itinerary so I have to buy a new USD 100 ticket. So, I am USD 100 out of pocket. Customer service is non-existing with SIA. 3 weeks ago my domestic flight (not SIA) got re-scheduled and I arrived very early at MNL so I went to the SIA counter and asked if they could put me on the 2 hour earlier flight to Changi. My flight from Changi to Europe would be the same. So, I would have a 5 hour lay-over in Changi instead of 3 hours. SIA replied that they could do that but asked me to pay a change fee. I declined and took my original flight. I might think it is poor customer service but I acknowledge that they were in their full right to want to charge a change fee although it is in both our interest to increase my buffer time to reduce the risk of missing my connection.

I did notice some cost saving measures that I had not previously seen on SQ. No amenity kits, which I did not miss but no longer serving sachets of salt and pepper with the meals is a mistake. Airline meals generally lack flavour so I did miss the black pepper. There was also a smaller selection of snacks in the galley.

At SFO check-in counter, I stood at the head of the Premium Economy line for 15min as passengers who had come after me were attended to before me.

Later the customers in front of me request for drinks & I heard the flight attendant said “this is a plane not a bar”, this is very rude to a customer even you mean well to control consumption of alcohol.

Paying extra $120 each for these seats was a waste of money. The food (including ""Book the Cook"") was not extraordinary. The entertainment selection (movies, music, TV series) was inadequate. I understand that the flight crew needed rest during this long journey. However, not cleaning the toilet bin was unacceptable. I've flown other competitors on Premium Economy (ANA, EVA) and I can attest that the toilets for Premium Economy were kept immaculate during the long legs to either Japan or Taipei.

I used the facility of “Book the Cook” for two of the four meals provided (return flight) but sadly the meals were unappetising, bland and why is the airline no longer providing salt and pepper? There was only one round of drinks offered so although premium economy is quite a bit more expensive than economy the benefits are small except for the leg space. Also had to use economy toilets which would have been fine except that they were not particularly well maintained but I do admit that both flights were full up so staff would have been kept busy.

Staff were very friendly with the service being first rate and a good selection of meals options. Very pleasant 4.5 hour flight. Flight arrived on-time but due to a medical emergency everyone had to remain seated until the person could be deplaned.

The seats were comfortable in business, although they could be less comfortable for a tall person. With the 787s, the space between the seat and the TV monitor is quite narrow and when the table is out, one must sit quite upright. It is not as comfortable as the Airbus or Qatar’s q-suites but definitely way better than 99% of other airlines.

Check-in was smooth save for the issue with them not allowing us to take the travel stroller, which folds into something the size of a briefcase on board as it wasn't in a carry bag? Random thing is 2 previous legs and several other flights with SQ this wasn't an issue but we were told it was a new rule. Odd thing cabin crew never heard of it and 3 days later from SIN-MUC there were no issues with it being taken as hand luggage. Flight boarded late due to a late arrival but some of the time was made up with a near on time arrival. The 787 has a tighter configuration than the A350 regional configuration. This means less seat width and what I perceived as a little less leg room. Plane was spotless. Given the choice I would take the A350 over the 787 as it has it beat in all areas. Crew were more or less going through the motions and a bit robotic. Entertainment options still top, not even with 4 legs flow in the same month did you run out of things to watch.

Until now I have been very happy with SQ and have always preferred it above Cathay Pacific (hence the extra 4 hours in taking these flights instead of the direct flights) The flight was great and nothing to complain .. as a cardholder I had access to the lounge and SQ has been always great in accepting my kids (younger then 12yrs) with me in their lounges. Upon arrival in Hong Kong I discovered that one of my suitcases was damaged (zipper was damaged and could not be used anymore)/I went straight to their handling agent and was offered 3 options: 1) they could provide me with a report for my travel insurance, 2) They could try to fix it or 3) I was offered 500 HKD (50 Euro) as compensation. I argued with them that they destroyed the luggage so why should my insurance pay for their damaged caused, also the 500HKD would never cover a new suitcase (bought a year ago) so I asked to see somebody from Singapore airlines .. a girl appeared and immediately the same offer was made but the amount got up to 800HKD .. I argued that the money wouldn't even cover a new one. So she agreed to have my luggage picked up from my place in Hkg and tried to have it repaired. Nothing happened for 3 days and I was forced to contact the airline direct. Anyway suitcase was picked up on Thursday and was told on Saturday afternoon that they couldn't fix it and would offer me 1080HKD (no idea how they came to that amount) and it was a take it or leave it deal.

I had had recent surgery and literally ran to the gate with my hand luggage. Ground staff are less than helpful as well - boarding using boarding groups is ridiculous- so much confusion and people trying to pass people putting luggage away. Why not call boarding by last few rows at a time rather than a huge boarding group.

"""lack of crew dedicated to premium economy is an issue""",8,Ken Howie,12th December 2019,"Not Verified |  Johannesburg to Singapore in premium economy on the late flight. The incoming flight was delayed as the preceding flight was late departing the gate, and only arrived at the time boarding was supposed to start. However following a very quick turnaround and very efficiently organised boarding, the flight departed on time. There was the usual warm welcome from the crew, who were very active helping passengers stow belongings and settle in. Singapore Airlines do not offer pre-departure drinks, unlike most airlines in premium economy. The seat is comfortable, with good legroom and recline. The calf rest serves little purpose, and is difficult to retract when deployed, which is usually by accident. It was noted that very few passengers used the calf rest. The cabin overall is very pleasant. Service commenced promptly after take off. There was no separate drinks run, which is understandable with a late departure. The meal can best be described as typical airline food, the best part being the ice cream. Service and food is strictly economy class, no crockery nor tablecloth, and from Johannesburg no opportunity to book the cook. Drinks are served in plastic tumblers, with a somewhat meagre offering. A good champagne is offered in premium economy, but in a plastic faux stemmed glass that is even smaller than the standard tumbler. No refills are offered until the trays are cleared somewhat later. Both my wife and I were able to sleep for several hours, and it seemed quite strange to be woken up from a deep sleep to be offered lunch. This was about two hours before landing, which was ahead of schedule. De-planing was quick, and immigration and luggage collection super efficient, as is the norm at Changi. Overall this was a good flight, with excellent service measured against the standard of economy.

I am not saying my previous SQ flight was bad or awful, it was great but I did feel like they could have improved more. But, my recent flight with SQ was near flawless! It seemed like they had listened to customer’s feedback and made the overall experience better. The most obvious improvement was the IFE system. They employed the newest technology regarding the IFE system, the screen was wide and really responsive to touch. The colors were bright, there were some of the newest released movies available and the available media content (music, video, movies) were more than enough to accompany your whole journey. I didn’t even open my ipad throughout my trip. The seats were redesigned, I felt more comfortable and the leg space was spacious. The food and beverage was even more tastier and ever. At the moment, for me, it is the best airline! It’s not perfect though, I want SQ to outdo themselves and become better overtime. If I could give one suggestion, I would like them to provide wireless connection for the headphones because their in house earphones don’t cut it and most of todays head/earphones are wireless.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Jakarta to Munich via Singapore,November 2019,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5,yes

Leg from Sydney to Singapore the plane left on time, but what a disappointment the boarding process is, compared to Changi. The Boarding by Group No is a neat idea and works well at Changi, but Sydney is just the usual fare of Economy passengers standing in a massive queue trying to get on as quickly as possible and staff announcing the boarding by group, but not enforcing it. And the overhead screens showed Group 4 non-stop whilst they boarded other groups, whatever. Service on board was warm and welcoming, food was good but, surprisingly, even though it was announced, no immigration cards were handed out. When I asked, I was told they didn’t have any. I think they just ran out of time. Love flying on the A380, spacious, calm and quiet, it’s a great experience. Got into Changi a few minutes early. Next day afternoon take off for FRA on 777. Food was sparse and mediocre but not bad. Just not quite the same standard and amounts as last year. The entertainment system has a big screen but the amount on offer is nowhere near Emirates standard and it is harder to find things/operate and the touchscreen is sometimes not as responsive as one would have liked. Crew again, very good and friendly. Lots of snacks available incl very fresh apples during meal times, the wines from Chile were excellent and the crew was always walking around with drink trays.

Furthermore, on the return trip, my wife received 3 oily and smelly Samosas. Who serves 3 samosas in one sitting? What is the chef thinking? 2) the staff while polite was not involved as they usually are. In my experience, Singapore Airlines makes a very conscious attempt to connect with travellers. They aim to make you as comfortable as possible, however, this time there was a non-commital attitude which was very unlike them. I had to ask for water more times then I can remember.

If I knew I had to bring confirmation of the meal request, I would have done that.  They heated up my daughter's meal without asking so it had to be thrown away because it needs to be consumed within one hour and she was sleeping because the flight was a night flight. The seats are uncomfortable for a 16 hour flight. I feel that economy plus seats for a long-haul flight should recline more. Also, the seats were really difficult for me to recline.

Even in economy, we have a USB charging port, which is a plus. Food was average. We had a choice between a western and an Asian dish. The servings were generous, and we ate from a tray with metal utensils - which is a big plus considering the number of airlines that feed us out of cupboard.

"""do not seem to be committed to premium economy""",8,Ken Howie,12th October 2019,"✅ Trip Verified | 
Brisbane to Singapore on the late night flight. Boarding was on time and proceeded smoothly, with the usual warm welcome from the cabin crew. The seating and space is good, as expected in premium economy, with ample locker space. The seats include a leg support which is ineffective, and the footrest is not very good. There are no pre-flight drinks, unlike other airlines premium economy, and the water bottles had not been put out into the holders. This seems to be a hit and miss affair, sometimes the bottles in place on boarding, and other times only handed out later. Having water available immediately at least compensates to some degree for the lack of pre-take off drinks. Drinks were served with the meal shortly after take off, and again the Singapore attitude to premium economy is apparent. Food is the same as economy served on plastic trays, with no linen or crockery. Drinks are served in plastic tumblers. SQ advertise champagne available throughout the flight, and serve a good quality champagne, but in a tiny plastic tumbler. Service starts in premium economy, but the same crew carry on through economy, and trays remain until service is complete, and no drink refills are offered in the meantime. Water bottles were eventually handed out after meal service. Singapore economy class service is probably the best in the world, and on this flight the crew were superb. Unfortunately they do not seem to be committed to premium economy, and the enhancements which are provided by their competitors are absent. The primary justification for the “premium” price is space and comfort, which is provided, but having paid a not insignificant premium on the fare the expectation of an improved service level does not seem unreasonable. Overall the flight was good, with a superb crew, and it is unfortunate that SQ do not match other airlines with their premium economy service.",A359,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Brisbane to Singapore,October 2019,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4,yes

This flight was on time and passengers were boarded according to section. I was lucky that there was a spare seat between myself and the guy with the aisle seat. Once we took off, the passenger in front reclined (day flight) and it sure makes economy feel so squeezy. Unlike their promise on the website that you won’t be packed like sardines, you are. I can’t eat fish but I guess SQ decided to save money by incorporating all allergies. My breakfast was gluten free (revolting hard dry roll), no dairy and no sugar. I was appalled by it compared to the normal breakfast. I am glad I brought snacks like chocolate and cookies. The selection of entertainment was fine and the toilets are kept clean.

"""my worst Economy flight ever""",5,D Keale,8th October 2019,"✅ Trip Verified |  Singapore to Adelaide. I dont know what happened to Singapore Airlines but just had my worst Economy flight ever. I am on the tall side with over 1.90cm but have had no issues on this flight over the decades on A310/A340/777/A330 in Eco and the occasional Biz class. My 1st time on their new A350-900 with their new economy seating and will be my last. The legroom is non existent.  My knees were in constant contact with the seat infront. If the person infront of you decides to recline then you get to enjoy the screen about 20cm from your face. The seats are an absolute nightmare. Not only is the pitch terrible but also the width which is a complete joke. If you are travelling with a family member then fine otherwise you get to enjoy constant shoulder rubbing with your neighbour. The seat padding is the hardest i have come across. Having flown Thai's A350-900 the weekend before to Bangkok in standard eco seat as well and having no issues, I was looking forward to the SQ experience. What an incredible let down that was. The Thai product is so much better which is something i would have thought I would never say when comparing to SQ. Even Emirates a few months before in Economy was an absolute joy in comparison. The inbound flight was a 23:10 departure and our dinner consisted of a beverage and a packet of peanuts before lights were turned off. 4 hours later breakfast was served which consisted of yoghurt, a bit of fruit, bread roll and flavourless noodles or omelette. Not being able to sleep, you had to play catch the crew walking past if you wanted water. Not being heavyset, the tray actually pushed into my stomach when folded out which was also a new experience. On the return leg I managed to get the extra legroom seat in row 55 which was fine legroom wise but it was even more narrow then the standard seat as the tray folds out of the armrest taking up width. Compared to the standard economy seat this one is bearable for the 7 hours but again, not for anything longer. Whilst boarding and scanning the ticket the ground staff in ADL remarked"" oh, I am glad you got that seat as you are tall"". Whilst on board and having settled into the seat, the steward's pre-empted my seat neighbour's and my comment with ""yeah i know, they are very narrow"" so I can imagine the number of complaints about their seats. My neighbour and I, whilst trying to avoid shoulder contact had a lengthy discussion about how terrible these SQ seats have become. I will be exploring other carriers and connections in future as the premium paid for Singapore Airlines is simply not there anymore. Reading the number of gripes on the web about their Biz seats as well, I will be sure to choose other carriers in the future which saddens me as have been flying Singapore Airlines my entire life and had them in the highest regard until now but wont be enduring this torture ever again.

"""No personalised service""",5,Karen Pamela Dompor,23rd September 2019,"Not Verified |  The check-in process is always a breeze. This is probably the best thing about SingAir. Boarding is also a quick process. Most of the planes are a bit aged. Thus the screen or the audio jack may not work. The newer planes have better legroom. Although I always sneeze whenever I ride their planes, therefore the seats may not be disinfected regularly. They try to have a variety of dishes, but if you ride SingAir frequently, you will notice that the names of the dishes may change but the taste is just the same. I always like their salads. The crew do their job like clockwork, and that's about it just like an automatic clock. No personalised service, no understanding the needs of the passengers. I've been to a lot of flights with SingAir and you may have 1 or 2 passengers who can be a bit demanding and needy, but the rest are understanding. Frequent flyers know that they have a hundred and million things to do, but being an attendant is like a profession just like being a doctor who commits himself/herself to every patient under their care. That is the demand of the job. Lastly, it is very rare that SingAir flights are delayed, but in the rare occasions that they are, SingAir does not offer provisions for passengers who are inconvenienced by it. We don't need fancy hotels but maybe a space where we can relax other than the airport chairs or offer a massage or offer a meal or drink. Other airlines do that, why can't SingAir? Overall, SingAir is still a good airline if you are not very particular about things like the attendants being sensitive and aware that passengers are people that they should be taking care of or that the food tastes the same even though the names are different or hey don't offer anything to passengers who are inconvenienced with the delays.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Thailand ,September 2019,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,3,yes

Well I am not going to forget the battles I have had and the ignorance and contempt their administration has demonstrated on every occasion. They have lost me. The in-flight Service cannot override my sentiments. Do not bother if you are anything but a passenger who is happy to hand over your money and accept great service when your basic requests are treated so poorly. The Admin team is inept and say ""Yes"" to every request yet failed to deliver. The cabin crew could not believe the admin ignored me until I showed them the emails.

No aisle seats was available in Business class despite a prior agreement that one would be aboard. I may as well have not bothered dealing with the airline.

An hour after take off the first meal was served, and I chose the Korean beef short rib. This was really good. I used the online Book the Cook to choose the meal, which was a great service. The menu also included an amenity kit with some really soft eye mask, a toothbrush, a comb, and some socks on request. In the back at the galley there was a self serve snack bar. Also there are 2 free checked bags with SQ premium economy. They served some snacks in the middle of the flight for those who were still awake, and I got an apple. They also handed out water bottles in the beginning of the flight, which was very generous. Then in the morning I got breakfast, some noodles and pork, and that was really good.

"""unable to select the seat""",1,R Hicks,31st August 2019,Not Verified |  We have flown multiple times via Singapore airlines and on each occasion we have had an issue of some kind usually related to seats and Singapore ground staff. Despite complaints directly to the airline I always feel I am wasting my time so I might as well go public with a review. The cabin is nearly always nice and the service is generally good although I have previously been left unable to eat as the only food left has been noodles with prawns and I have an allergy to prawns. On this occasion however we booked our tickets in business class and now that we attempt to select seats we are told we are unable to select the seat. The options are single seats spread around the cabin with no option to sit close to each other over a 12+ hour flight - that said we are still unable to book. We booked the tickets 10 months ago and I refuse to accept we were the last people to book this flight. We have contacted customer services to receive the answer seats are subject to availability. While I can accept that there are limitations on seating we are in advance of online check-in and were just checking available seats of which there are half a dozen dotted around the cabin. To be effectively told tough luck for a $5000 seat is just not acceptable. Unless you are flying alone I would not recommend Singapore airlines.

However, I have a complaint about passengers bringing on too much luggage as they call these seats last when you get on the plane. All the overhead lockers are full of other passengers bags - we had to put our luggage at least 6 compartments down from where we were sitting. A worry when I had all our passports etc in one of the bags as on take-off we could not have a bag near us and no seats to put it under. My major complaint is that as we were the first row after the Premium compartment and when meals etc were served they were served from the other end of the plane - we were last to be served. No offer of pre-dinner drinks (I had to get up and ask the crew after our meals were served). We had no choice in dinner we had what was left! Chicken! At breakfast the same happened all there was left was noodles and beef. I said to the crew I would like the scrambled egg please and he said it had all gone. I said I did not want noodles for breakfast so off he went and minutes later he brought scrambled egg dish. They forgot my husband and after 10 minutes they came with a breakfast meal. Why on earth do they give you a flash menu if they can't serve you what you want? All in all a disappointing flight I always put Singapore Airlines in high regards but not this time.

It was my first time on Singapore Airlines and I had pretty high hopes for the airline, and they were mostly fulfilled. The crew were very nice and clear about situations going on inflight. Considering I was flying economy, I would give them a good pass. Before boarding, the staff at the gate were pretty excited to welcome passengers. The seats were comfortable though my headrest was rather broken as its height was not adjustable. I enjoyed the seat pockets (you can organise your stuff pretty well) and everything felt good in quality. I also enjoyed the inflight entertainment. The screen was massive and clear and everything was responsive. The selection of movies was also really good with many rather recent movies. They provided an earphone adapter so you could use your own earphones easily when using the inflight entertainment. They distributed a menu before take-off. The food was quite good though my seat neighbours did not like it as much as I did. They provided drinks throughout the 12-hour flight. What I was surprised about, though, is that you can use your roaming data on the flight! In this case, you wouldn't need to purchase to the expensive onboard WiFi but instead, just subscribe for internet through your own data service provider.

Food was reasonably good (omelette or nasi lemak), and we landed on time also. Crew were a little rushed and courteous rather than friendly, but good enough.

At the time of serving food, they served the entire plane before us, rows ahead of us and rows behind us, but did not offer us any food. after 2 hours of takeoff, with the entire plane almost dozed off after their meals, they came to us only to inform, they have no food available. Only 1 tray, that too with Fish. We were with a kid, hungry. Had we have known this, we would have had our own meal at the airport. On confronting them, they could only apologize. But somehow managed to get a veg tray from somewhere and we fed the little one. The entire journey we got nothing to eat! We travelled without meals.   6 hours journey. They had no remorse. Called them to serve water, they did not bother to serve it.  It was a nightmare of a flight. 4 of us were hungry throughout and were waiting for this nightmare to end as soon as possible.

"""there is nothing premium about the service""",7,Ken Howie,19th August 2019,"✅ Trip Verified | Johannesburg to Singapore in premium economy on the recently introduced second flight. Priority boarding after business class allows time to settle in, with ample space in the overhead lockers. Just three rows in the cabin, with good legroom and comfortable seats, which have a decent recline. There is a footrest on the seat in front, and a calf rest attached to the seat, which seems to serve no purpose other than create problems for the crew in trying to them stowed for landing. Good sized TV screen which is easy to operate. Overall the hard product is good. However there is nothing premium about the service, which is strictly economy. There are no pre take-off drinks, and there was no bar service after take-off prior to the meal. This may have been due to the late hours departure and a wish to serve the meal as quickly as possible, but one would have thought that with a maximum of 24 in premium economy this would not have been a big issue. Amenity kits are no longer handed out, but the menu indicated they were available on request. Meals were tasty, but the same as economy, served on plastic trays. No sign of table cloths and proper crockery as shown on the website. Drinks are served in plastic as opposed to glasses, and in small quantities. Wine was a basic white or red in a small plastic tumbler half filled. Fruit juice slightly larger serving, but still meagre. No offers of refills until the trays were eventually removed. There are no dedicated crew in premium economy. Service starts with premium, but then proceeds through economy, with clearing starting at the back of economy, so that premium economy is the last to be cleared. With the time difference the second meal was lunch. This time I ordered champagne, served in a plastic stemmed “glass” amounting to half a normal glass, again no refills offered until trays cleared, at which time the champagne had disappeared from the trolly. The main reason for choosing premium economy is space and comfort, on which there are no complaints. However notwithstanding the fact that Singapore economy is amongst the best, it is not a premium economy service.

Haven't not been on economy class of Singapore for quite some time, I decided to try it for it's a short haul flight plus it's price factor was very good this time. The usual high standard of SIA is there with the immaculately groomed kebaya-clad crew, and the good condition of the plane and its amenities etc. Hot towel service is still provided in economy class which is a nice touch. Menu is not given since it's a short sector. Hot drinks, cold beverages and meals are all served in one go, which cuts time and makes good sense. However, one can clearly see some cost cutting with the portion of the meal smaller, and the taste was rather bland and mediocre. Boeing 787 on the way to BKK was a fine plane, except the seat pitch and the aisle are all very narrow. Sat at the aisle, I was constantly bumped by the crew and passengers, there's almost nowhere foe me to hide as I wild be spilling onto my neighbour's space. It's quite frustrating really. Also the tray table is so close to my stomach, it's uncomfortable to say the least. Touch screen AVOD was very good, and pre-ordered duty free was dully delivered without delay.

"""absolutely appalled by the service""",2,John Mathiopoulos,25th July 2019,"Not Verified |  Such terrible service from the outset! After making the booking which included a code share arrangement for 2 adults with an infant, everything started well with a bassinet being requested. From that point I had to call at least four times with apparent issues with the names on itinerary even though they were correct from the outset. This issue arises again upon attempting online check in which wasn’t at all possible because one adults name was somehow written in twice, once as a Mr and one as a Mrs. called and requested a business class upgrade. Was told due to code share it wasn’t possible (hello I’m trying to give you my money)! Thereafter we arrived at the airport to a very rude staff member once again telling me the names were incorrect in the system, even though the night before I had the itinerary emailed to me from Singapore airlines customer call centre showing correct details, after the initial attempt to check in failed, which confirmed names were correct, I showed this document as proof, lady appeared uninterested. codeshare 2nd leg of journey had tickets produced at Melbourne airport by Singapore staff and after being flustered by this to and fro at check in I didn’t bother to check the seat allocation for the 2nd leg which didn’t have bassinet allocation. To our horror we discovered the Singapore Airlines check in lady had allocated us seats in different rows on opposite sides of the plane with a one year old! How can they be so unprofessional? The worst part, when transiting through SIN I approached the transfer counter of the codeshare airline, which is Singapore’s budget carrier Scoot and this helpful assistant was able to pair us together, making the MEL - SIN Singapore employees actions even worse. To top it off the flight wasn’t full, but also we cannot purchase additional baggage online due to once again the codeshare arrangement and furthermore we arrive at our final destination and discovered both our suitcases were broken with the wheels coming off before we exited the airport. Having flown many major international airlines overseas, I will never fly with Singapore again. It’s an indictment on Singapore Airlines that the service and experience on the 2nd leg operated by Scoot overall in SIN airport and on board was far superior to the Singapore airlines journey to SIN. If going Australia to Europe, I highly recommend you consider a Middle East airline that shows accountability and pride in their responsibility to fare paying passengers.

"""the worst most arrogant crew""",1,Guido Bornemann,9th July 2019,"✅ Trip Verified |  We flew Johannesburg to Singapore on SQ479 on July 7th in Business Class and experienced the worst most arrogant crew ever. I travelled with my wife and 2 Daughters (2 and 4 years old) and we were assigned seats 19F and 20D and F. As the seats are very closed, we would have preferred to sit all in one row, so we asked at Check In to be seated in one row, either 19 or 20. They told us it was fully Business Class, but they will leave a note and we can check at the Gate. We did, but the passengers on the window seats did not want to move, which was OK to us as they have been faster than us, so it is OK. Upon closing of the doors, we saw that Seat 20K was free, so I asked the flight attendant if my wife can move then from 19F, so we can sit in one row. She said this is a cockpit seat and she needs to check with the pilot. Upon departure she came back and told us that the pilot does not want to change the seat to 19F or 21K. Really? A pilot who used this seat for 30 minutes does not want to move one row back to let a family with 2 Kids sit in one row?

"""The seat was in a word, horrible""",7,K Pataporn,4th July 2019,"✅ Trip Verified |  Bangkok to Singapore . I was looking forward to flying Singapore Airlines and their new B787-10. I had set my expectations at the same level as Qatar Airways, seeing the fact that they are both 5-star airlines. With this in mind, I would firstly like to say that I was not impressed with Singapore Airlines, as they were quite inconsistent across the categories. The website is user-friendly, but I did encounter some glitches. Online check in is slightly confusing but I was able to manage. We arrived at Bangkok Airport 3.15 hours before our flight, and the check in counters opened 2.45 hours before the flight. It was extremely confusing which line is for which passenger, as they separate Business and Gold into different lines. In the end we were very quickly checked in at the gold counter. Luckily at that time of day security and immigration moved quickly. The Silverkris lounge in Bangkok is in a word, exquisite. The decor is very fancy and there is a manned bar with a barista making craft drinks and all sorts of coffee. Seats were plenty, clean and even the toilets are cleaned after every use! The breakfast buffet was slightly disappointing, but I have come to expect that with all airlines. Boarding was extremely confusing, they asked gold members to queue up with business class but the sign asks them to queue up at the economy door. Not only that, they board business class passengers first then gold members, which makes a mess! Other Star Alliance carriers just board gold and business at the same time. Hassle free! I received a warm welcome at the door, and found my seat. The flight attendant was even kind enough to help my mum lift her suitcase into the overhead compartment! I would never expect a flight attendant to do it out of the blue! The seat was, in a word, horrible. It was so narrow! Qatar Airways also has 3-3-3 seating on their 787s, but it wasn't this narrow. I'm slightly large, but even my rather small mum sat shoulder-to-shoulder with the other passenger in the window seat! Legroom was fine. What I don't get is that these aircraft with small seats are being deployed on flights as far as Brisbane, an 8 hour hop. However, the bad seat was overshadowed by the service. On my outbound flight from Bangkok, I chose a seafood meal and got the same thing I get all the time flying Star Alliance out of Bangkok, mixed grilled seafood served with tomatoes, peas and duchess potatoes. The catering was provided by Thai Airways, and even had the Thai Airways logo on it. Needless to say, it was very nice. On my return flight, when coming around for drinks, the lovely flight attendant noticed me checking the white wine bottle to see what it was, and I love the way she asked if I wanted the Sauvignon Blanc rather than""white wine.  The crew on Singapore Airlines are fantastic, and very hardworking. Entertainment was adequate, I wouldn't be bored even on the longest flight. On the return flight, we checked in 7 hours before departure time as we wanted to explore Jewel. Absolutely recommended. The gold lounge in Terminal 2 was an absolute disappointment! Even the Thai Airways lounge in T1 is better! Other than that, this flight was almost identical, except for some very strong turbulence. Overall, Singapore Airlines is a good choice. If they can improve their seat and value their star gold more, I would be a returning customer.",Boeing 787-10,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Singapore ,July 2019,2.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4,yes

I wasn't asked for a drink with our meals and the meals unfortunately didn't save the day either. Most of the time we had to queue at the lavatory (the layout of the plane for PE is horrible), because the 2 lavatories were used by Economy as well. The lavatory situation in Economy was much better, nobody surely had to queue there (11 lavatories according to the seat map!). It didn't help that a family with two toddlers and a crying baby was sitting in the same row. On the positive side were the headphones (even if they had to replace my headphones straightaway) and the entertainment system.

The stewardess briskly shoved us our meal trays and asked if I want any beverages with my meal. I replied with my choice of beverage (coffee). She simply walked away after acknowledging my request without saying anything at all. I thought maybe she didn't have coffee on her tray so she went to get some. But she never returned. I was appalled by this. Next was snack time. A different stewardess came with the snack tray ask if we would like any snacks. As my sister was hungry and we saw on the menu that sandwiches and wraps was available in the snack menu, I requested for a sandwich/wrap. The stewardess reply was a brusque ""I don't have any, I'll check"" and she too walked away without coming back. What ever happened to our friendly SQ crew?

"""Such a disappointment""",5,David Killick,3rd June 2019,"✅ Trip Verified |  Such a disappointment Christchurch to Singapore seats 33H and 33K, and SIN-CHC 32D and 32E in premium economy. We had really been looking forward to the new A359 taking over from the old 777 on the Christchurch to Singapore route with the choice of premium economy. Unfortunately, the bean counters seem to have designed the cabin! The configuration is 2x4x2 — just one seat less than economy — compared with 2x3x2 for Lufthansa in premium economy in the same type of aircraft, which we enjoyed for the next leg of our trip to Europe. The lavatories are the size of a small cupboard and there is no space to get up and stretch your legs in the cabin, unlike earlier aircraft. Going over was OK in the two seats by the window, but as others have pointed out, the central armrest and padded seatbelt (it contains an airbag) intrude on space. Inflight food and service was fine, if not memorable. Coming back overnight stuck in the middle seats was a lot worse. Space feels very tight. Not all menu choices were available, and we got beef mince, which was not very good at all. We asked for eggs for breakfast but got yam cake. A gentleman two seats along turned on his overhead lamp at about 3:00 am (he should have used the reading lamp). No eyeshades or earplugs provided. We asked for some but still got no sleep. Screens didn't work for two of the passengers in front of us. This flight ended up being diverted because of fog, adding six hours to the nine hour flight (of course, not SIA’s fault) but the whole experience was very tiring. One other thing: Electronic check-in at Changi was confusing and everyone had to ask what step to do next. It should be much clearer. We have flown with SIA for 35 years and feel they are trading on their past good reputation and really need to lift their game. Premium economy on SIA really isn’t worth the extra cost.

Very cheap and nasty especially considering there was no drink on boarding or pre-dinner. 15 mins or so later the drinks arrived by which time my meal was cold but on my request they reheated it (another wait). The red wine was awful. Throughout the flight the curtains to Economy remained open so that didn't make you feel the extra expensive brought any benefit.

"""I would not recommend""",1,Andrew Tucker,1st May 2019,"✅ Trip Verified |  I cannot believe that this flight was the exact opposite of my last flight on SIA, when I went to the Philippines to see my daughter. Absolutely dreadful. This was a typical 'red eye' flight, and I'm at least 90% sure that SIA had reduced the leg pitch on this aircraft. Granted, I am 194cms tall, and that does not help the situation at all, but still, there were a number of things that were wrong on this flight. There was a gent in front of me who decided that he wanted to recline his seat back into me to the full extent, during taxi - it was ignored by the cabin crew. And it stayed like this for the remainder of the flight to Perth. I was served a meal by cabin crew with my tray table firmly poking into my chest. Not a single word was said to this gentleman in front of me by staff. Thank God we landed in Perth on time, I felt like I had to unravel my body to get off the plane. The passenger in question was only asked to move his seat upright about ten minutes prior to landing at Perth airport. In fairness, prior to writing this, I had written an email of my concerns to the airline. I was met with a 'we don't care' kind of convoluted reply, probably from somebody who knows nothing about aircraft.

"""really felt disappointment""",5,Zvi Rosen,22nd April 2019,"✅ Trip Verified |  My son and I flew Business class Singapore to Shanghai in April. The Business lounge in Changi is OK, but nothing to write home about. We ordered ' book the cook' option, one chicken Brest and one Steak dish. Upon boarding we were greeted by a very cheerful crew, the flight manager already knew my name without looking at any list. The seat was incredibly wide,but quite hard in my opinion. My tail bone tells me immediately, as I was injured in a ski accident, and I can't sit in a regular economy seat more than 2 hours. I was a bit disappointed, as Aeroflot  Business seat from Moscow to Shanghai was much softer and pampering. After take off I went to the bathroom, and upon my return I found the satay dish awaiting me. I only enjoyed the chicken stick. Then no service for almost 45 min, without one cabin staff in sight .Slowly the magic and excitement were wearing off. Eventually one  showed up and asked me if I didn't like it. I said I only liked the chicken and she offered me some more, nice gesture, but I declined. There were maybe 15 passengers in Business class,that I believe can fit 50-60 passengers. Not a tough flight for the crew. Then came a green salad, very average,and then my book the cook meal showed up, which was good. As I like to drink with my main meal, and my glass was almost empty, as it Lasted me through the salad and the Satay, it was time to refresh my glass,but not such offer. I buzzed the cabin crew,and asked for another glass of drink. I kept enjoying my meal awaiting my drink that never showed up. I buzzed the crew again,and this time the flight manager showed up, I asked to have my drink if possible with my meal not with the dessert. The Coke showed up in 5 seconds. Then came the dessert, a dish with Ice cream, no choices, and a Fruit basket, the most basic desert cart I ever saw. At that point I was already regretting the huge amount of money invested in trying to experience the top notch Business class.  Then I wanted to rest,but the crew must turn your seat upside down, very weird idea,and even with the thin mattress ,it was far from a pampering bed.IF you feel like sitting down again,you have to call the F/A to flip it over to a seat..Personaly I prefer control of my lying situation, rather than calling the FA. No amenity kit distributed, but I heard that they pass by with a choice of amenities that you may find necessary for your trip -  no such basket was offered. My 14 yo son told me after the meal that he still felt hungry. I called his flight attendant  who seemed amused by my statement and said she will 'take care of him' - she brought him a small pack of nuts. So much for generosity. At Aeroflot, upon hearing that my son was still hungry (growing boy,) brought him a pasta casserole from Business class. Free WiFi to Business class was a great idea.

"""disappointed and annoyed""",1,Hollie Price,5th April 2019,"✅ Trip Verified | London to Perth via Singapore. Having flown with Singapore before I was sure that they would be helpful and accomodating as we flew with our 5 month old to visit family at Christmas. We checked in the pram and car seat after paying to have them wrapped at the airport and had arranged to have a bassinet seat for the flight. This was all arranged with no problems. However, around an hour into the flight I was very aware that my baby needed to be changed. I went to queue for the toilets and there was 6 people ahead of me in the queue. My baby began to scream, I’m sure to the discomfort of the other passengers. I was very aware of this and decided to try and find another bathroom with a smaller queue. The only one with no queue and a change table was in business class. As I approached, one of the cabin staff asked where I was going. I said “sorry, my baby is screaming I just need to change her” she said “you can’t use these toilets you have to go back” I explained the queue situation but she wouldn’t budge so I had to go and queue with my child screaming and all the other passengers glaring at me. When we arrived at Perth airport we were annoyed to find that out pram was broken. Despite having it wrapped, it had been broken through the wrapping and the footrest was hanging off despite the fact we had only had it for 5 months. I checked the airline policies which stated we were covered up to a certain amount so I emailed them within 48 hours with the relevant forms, photos of damage, boarding passes and purchase receipts. They responded after a few days with a very unprofessional email basically requesting the same information I had already sent. I sent it again. Twice. They sent another badly worded email asking me to drop it off somewhere for assessment. By this point we had been back with our taped up pram for about two weeks. I responded explaining that it’s the only pram we have and we couldn’t drop it off. We had done everything they had asked. I never heard anything back.

"""not very well designed""",5,Glenda Sewell,19th March 2019,"Not Verified |  Singapore to London Heathrow. For my holiday to New Zealand in February / March this year I decided to upgrade my flights for all four legs of the journey to business class. Three parts of my journey were enjoyable, the service and food was good, even though I didn't receive the book the cook meals Id ordered. Sadly on the last leg from Singapore to London flight SQ322 I found myself on the A380-800. I found the business class section to be cramped, with a lack of storage space, not very well designed and for a new plane starting to show signs of wear and tear. The first problem was the width of the seat, it was a lot narrower than other seats in business class. I heard a lady behind me complaining to a stewardess about the hard seat. She replied that BMW had designed it. My thought was what is comfortable in a sports car is not so good on a 13-15 hour flight where you are sitting / lying down for nearly all the time. However with cushions it can be made more comfortable. Nothing can be done to make the seat wider and the high and very wide plastic infill between my seat and the window made me feel more cramped. I could see no useful purpose for it. The lack of storage space was a problem. I didn't want to put my carry on bag in the overhead lockers as it could be difficult / noisy to access it on a night flight. Unlike some other planes there was no small recess area where I could put my bag on the floor, but within my seating area, so the aisle was still clear. A stewardess put it on the floor but when the bed was out I couldn't access it without grovelling about on the floor. I made my bed up and tried to sleep. I placed my handbag on top of the large but fairly useless plastic infill, during the flight I think as a result of turbulence the bag fell on my head. I wasn't impressed at the time but later on I did see the funny side of it. As the seat / bed was narrow when I turned over I kept hitting my head. It was also quite difficult to get up from. I've had no such difficulties on other business class flights . The design, space and attractiveness is so much better on other Singapore Airlines business class cabins. I know the other passengers in my group flying in business on this flight were unhappy too. While I was queuing to leave the plane at the end of the flight a man of average height and regular weight said That thing is a waste of space refering to the plastic infill between the seat and the window. I had to agree. A senior stewardess told me the airline is planning to convert more of their planes to this design. Thanks for the warning. When I fly to Australia next year I will have to look for a new provider.

"""you lost a loyal flyer""",3,P Rachitra,27th February 2019,"✅ Trip Verified |  San Francisco to Bangalore via Singapore. I have flown Singapore Airlines from the past 20 years regularly until now, I considered myself to be a loyal customers. They used to care about customers before; apparently, being named the best airline in the world has gone to their head and they think they no longer have to satisfy their customers. I flew Premium economy recently to Bangalore and paid for the extra legroom seat--the flight was ordinary. I was expecting an offer to upgrade to business class before my flight and I have more than 50,000 pts. No such offer came--I tried to offer a bid, the system didn't allow me to. When I saw the flight, there were plenty of seats empty in Business class. Not sure why they don't want to offer the premium economy passengers to upgrade to business. Warning to everyone travelling from SFO--some connections to India have a very short layover--less than an hour. SA doesn't have any consideration that if the landing is a few minutes late and the connecting flight is within 30 minutes, they shouldn't make the passenger run from one terminal to another even using Skytrain. I barely made it before the gate closed (with my bad knees). Remember, you have to go through security in Singapore when you have a connecting flight. I had to rush from Terminal B to C with no time even to rush to the restroom let alone freshen up.  While returning from Bangalore, I had ~4 kgs extra. Instead of asking me to pay using my Krisflyer (over 50,000) points, Singapore airlines charged me for a whole extra piece. So watch out, even if you are just 2-4 kgs over the limit in Premium economy, they will charge the cost of a suitcase. I even asked to pay for the upgrade in Bangalore, the said I can't do it in the last minute using points and I should check during my layover in Singapore (~ 2 hours). When I tried to upgrade for the longer flight SIN - SFO, they said that I don't have enough points. I offered to pay with points and cash--they said I can't do that. They just didn't want me in Business class even with points or cash! I wanted to avoid paying extra weight fees as I would have below the limit int Business class. If this is not an example of not caring for customers or accommodating its Krisflyer members, I don't know what is. Why can't they charge per Kg extra weight instead of an additional piece of luggage like other airlines?   Flight and food was ordinary (food quality has declined from SF to Singapore), and the bathroom cleanliness both ways was not up to par like it used to be. Changi airport is exceptional of course. I am not sure I will  be flying this airline again while there are so many carriers who offer upgrades for a reasonable price and cheaper tickets. Not sure what to do with the balance points (more than 50,000 points) though.

A few days before we departed, we received an email from them encouraging us to bid on an upgrade to economy plus. Even indicated what was a “low” bid with less chance of getting the upgrade, so we paid a higher bid that gave us a “fair” chance. Shortly before our flight we received an email that we were approved and could book our seats. We immediately went to the seat selections and found only 4 seats available, none together or even close. We called Singapore Airlines but they said there was nothing available and our prior seats in economy were now taken. We again asked at the counter when we checked in but same answer - no seats available. We are in our 70’s and had to sit rows apart on different sides of the aircraft for this very long flight. One of the seats was in the last row of economy plus and was so cramped it was very difficult to get in and out to use the restroom. We suffered. When we returned home, we found out Singapore Airlines would not even give miles for the flight since it was initially booked in economy. We requested our money back as we felt taken and deceived with the charge, lack of disclosure, and the unacceptable and poor quality service provided.

""" one of the best out there""",10,Jeremy Teng,25th February 2019,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flew Singapore Airlines on my trip back from Japan on their A350-900, and the experience was really positive. In Tokyo Haneda, check in was very efficient, despite it being a full flight (perhaps as many wanted to return home for Christmas), and boarding was very fast too, although the managing could have been better as I witnessed some passengers holding only an economy class ticket using the business class queue. Despite the inclement weather, the flight took off very quickly, and after we left Tokyo the flight was smooth throughout. Aircraft wise, the A350 had always been a comfortable aircraft, and this was no exception - the product offered was very comfortable, and the legroom was good even in economy class. The cabin crew was also very warm and friendly and attentive to every passenger. After meal service was concluded the lights were dimmed to allow the passengers to sleep, as it was a night flight. The IFE was touchscreen, just like my previous flight with SQ on their 787 and very responsive, no problems encountered. The only downside was that SQ did not implement a tail camera that can be broadcast on the IFE - a pity, considering that the A350 has the technology and other A350 users such as Cathay Pacific and Thai Airways are using them. Not an important feature, but it would have been really cool to see it. I picked the Japanese selection for my meal, and it was very good. We arrived in Singapore early and the crew was also very friendly throughout. During the flight, they even left me a personalized message on my passenger flight logbook, and it was a really touching gesture that showed how much they cared for their passengers.

Food was reasonably good (had Indonesian option), and IFE was as standard on the A330, if slightly dated.

Having experienced United's version of the B787, this was an opportunity to revisit the experience on SQ instead on a short 2.5 hour flight. The initial entrance into the economy cabin is certainly more welcoming than United's experience. Once seated, you notice the high-density, thin seat cushions, which give you more perceived legroom than the standard 32 in pitch would suggest. Because SQ stayed with the 3-3-3 configuration, the seat width is narrower than the comparable A330 or B777 experience, and I certainly felt this was the case, despite the very narrow armrests. Certainly the aisles are narrow, and in the aisle seat, I was constantly jostled by passengers and assorted bags during the boarding process. I also found it hard to get comfortable on the thinner seats, though this was less of an issue for a short-haul flight. The IFE was a class above United's, with a large vibrant touchscreen and the newest KrisWorld experience (minus the seat controller), so all interactions are via the screen.

Online check-in process easy, I managed to call the hotline to change my seat to get an exit row with my parents which was done easily. SQ did even bother to send us an SMS to warn us about the French strikes blocking the roads and to go early to the airport subsequently. Very good point. I find the quality of service onboard below of that of few years ago, food standard and bland, staff with good hard-skills though (responsive, efficient and professional) but could be better - they talk very fast, robotic gestures and could be more smiling. On our inbound leg, they ran out of one food option which left us very disappointed. Seats on the Boeing 777-300ER larger and more comfortable compared with that of other premium airlines. For the outbound Jakarta-Singapore leg, they asked us if we wanted to take an earlier flight, so that we could have more buffer time transiting in Singapore for our next flight to Paris and not being too much in a hurry, which was a very good point.

"""Flight attendants were elegantly efficient""",6,R Sanyal,24th December 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Overnight flight delayed in takeoff due to airport congestion brought on by inclement weather. On boarding the large number of passengers on this oversized aircraft was impressively quick and smooth. Flight attendants were elegantly efficient - the female flight attendants were strikingly lissome. Sitting configuration was 3-4-3. Seats were comfortable but given that most seats were occupied, the cabin felt crowded. Lots of film choices on the seatback personal entertainment system, they were easy to access. Ample overhead luggage space. Leg space a bit tight. Seat reclination juts the backseat TV screen rather close to your face and the tray table to your tummy. In fact, the flight attendants, while serving meals, ensured that the passengers returned the seats to a more straight up position. A dinner and a breakfast were served. A multi page menu book was provided to all. There were two entree choices for both meals - no vegetarian choice. That was a shocking surprise. I chose the fish dish. It was amply portioned and tasty. The breakfast cold sandwiches were dry and virtually inedible. Predinner drinks were served in plastic tumblers from a tray that flight attendants carried - juice, beer, white wine were on offer. Dinner and breakfast cutlery were metal, not plastic. Duty free catalog was thick but nothing distinctive products on offer. Cockpit crew kept us informed of the flight and take off delays. Singapore Airlines should consider their impact on the environment - on this relatively short overnight flight they can simplify the breakfast and dinner, dispense with the paper menu and the basic amenities bag and ensure a vegetarian option as standard.

Took the front row bulkhead seat in PE on Boeing 777-300ER which gives quite a lot of legroom, the downside is the the inflight entertainment (IFE) system is tucked away on the floor, in a it's own separate housing. I eschewed the champagne and dinner for sleep, and here I still find the SQ PE seats very stiff and difficult to recline, it really takes quite a lot of effort to force the seat into a recline position. Nonetheless, there is a reasonable amount of elbow space, and the personal reading lights, noise-cancelling earphones and cubby holes give a sense of comfort. The IFE is the new touch-screen system with a separate seat controller handset. My IFE monitor refused to come out of it's housing, but the aircrew performed some magic with a knife and fork, and saved the day! Food (the breakfast that I tried) was reasonably good, and crew were proactive with drinks and snacks through the flight. The only downside of PE in the B777 series is that access to the shared toilets is at the rear with normal economy, and you have to manage the queues for access the best you can.

No food served until 5 hrs into the flight despite the fact everyone was awake due to screaming child. Drinks trolley never bought through. No snack service in galley like other flights do. Very disappointed. Food was average and service slow. I found it insulting that the IFE played a video showing all the features of the business class seat not once but twice, a lovely reminder to those in cattle class what they are missing.

Prior to my flight, I pre-ordered cordon blue for my dinner. It was just bad. Although the business section was not full, the flight attendants kept forgetting to deliver my drinks. During dinner, they offered red or white wine, and when I asked for a diet coke, they got lost completely. When I ordered a coffee, they gave me the coffee long after I finished my dessert but never delivered the stirrer.  The business seat is extremely uncomfortable. The cushion is hard covered with a thin layer of leather cover. Even adding the bedsheet won't help. The armrests are a piece of small folding plastic, I couldn't rest my arms comfortably on them. When I reclined the seat, I was unable to stretch my legs due to design of the leg room. One has to curve his/her legs to fit the shape of the leg room and it is extremely uncomfortable to sleep like that. The quality of the image and sound of entertainment is below average.

Among all the times I have flown with Singapore Airlines, this trip did not feel like Singapore Airlines at all. Firstly, there was a slight delay and the ground staff did not provide any information whatsoever. A bad start to the journey. After boarding the plane, I could feel that the cabin crew lacked warmth and hospitality. Shortly after takeoff, the cabin crew came round to serve the children first. They came to serve my 8 year old Sister the meal however they did not give her two choices to choose from. They just served my Sister chicken with rice. It turns out that the chicken with rice was too spicy. There were actually two choices (beef stew and chicken with rice) which left me wondering why they did not stop to ask my Sister what choice she wanted. They didn’t even tell her that the chicken with rice was spicy!  When the cabin crew came round to serve adults, they were very rushed and did not make themselves clear at all. They asked ‘stew or chicken rice?’. They didn’t bother to tell us what meat the stew was. And they also did not offer any drinks. You have to ask them yourselves. The service I experienced was far from the ‘superior quality’ Singapore Airlines used to offer. I understand the need to rush service a little as the flight was only a little over two hours. However that does not mean that they can treat passengers like that. Disappointed with Singapore Airlines this time round.

The food was delicious, especially given that it is airline food. The cabin was uncrowded and well laid out in business class. The lavatories were spacious, clean and well supplied. I was surprised by no amenity kits and no pajamas in business class on long flights, and the crew did not automatically offer to assist with turning the seat into a bed. The angle at which you could lay flat was on a slant  because of where your feet have to go.  The cabin music, when playing, is cloying, saccharin and unpleasant.

"""my best economy flight""",9,F Marber,11th October 2018,"✅ Trip Verified |  Hong Kong to London via Singapore. Singapore Airlines is my best economy flight experiences so far. When I arrived at Hong Kong airport, I mentioned to the ground crew doing my check-in that I was concerned about any delay as I only had 3 hours of layover at London Heathrow when I had to clear customs and wait for my checked bag before I travel from terminal 2 to terminal 5 to catch the BA flight to Leeds. She called someone and then went to ask her superior when she couldn’t get answer on the phone to see if it’s possible to check my bag to Leeds. I knew they couldn’t do that when the two airlines belong to different airline partnerships (One World for BA and Star Alliance for SQ).  When I came back to Hong Kong a week later, I asked the ground crew at check-in if they might have any row of 3-seaters available,  ground crew looked to see if two rows that were blocked could be released. She then assigned the aisle seat, blocked the middle seat, and said she would do her best not to assign anyone to the window seat if possible.  I was able to lie down from London to Singapore. When they served the main meal, I told a flight attendant that I wanted Peppermint tea  and I brought my own as other airlines I have flown never had peppermint tea. He said they did. Not only did he bring me a cup, he also gave me a few bags of them for my layover at the Singapore airport. SQ has the most comfortable pillow for economy class in my experience. The blanket was twice the size and thicker than that of United. The economy passengers also got an amenitY kit (socks, toothbrush, toothpaste) . They have a foot-paddle to open the trash bin in the restrooms. When I got to Singapore, I asked at the gate if there might be a 3-seater available for the flight to Hong Kong. They assigned me to a 2-seater by the window. ",Boeing 777-300,Business,Economy Class,Hong Kong to London via Singapore,September 2018,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5,yes

This incident might seem trivial, but such small things do make an impression and affect my decision to fly with the national carrier again.

There are no pre- take off drinks, and although champagne is offered when drinks are served after take off, it is in a tiny plastic faux wine glass. Wine is of mediocre quality served in a plastic tumbler. Top ups are a long time in coming as there are no dedicated premium economy crew, and the same staff serve the economy cabin. Meals were the same as economy with extras such as tablecloths absent. The main reason for traveling premium economy is space and comfort, and we had a very comfortable flight and slept well.

I booked the cook for all my flight meals when it was available. On none of the flights were any of the flight attendants aware that I had pre-ordered my meals. They always asked me what I wanted to order and I had to remind them that I had booked the cook.  On my last leg back home (Seoul to LAX), same problem occurred, but this time they forgot to serve me breakfast (despite being awoken almost 4 hours before landing). They served me the preliminary stuff but then I sat for another hour with no meal served. I went up to one of the flight attendants, and she notified me that she accidentally gave my pre-ordered meal to someone else. However, 10 minutes later, she came out with my correct meal, which tells me she simply just forgot to serve me.

My wife’s SIN-ROME booking using KrisFlyer points remains waitlisted on Business Saver Class despite 3 months of booking.

Despite being a loyal customer for over 30 years, a fair significant of which is as a PPS member until recently, the airline is unable to assist.

Perhaps I was spoiled by flying business class but I found the seating very tight and cramped. The inflight entertainment was also very old and limited. I am aware that SIA is introducing the new B787 for the SIN to PER route, this change is well overdue. Another item is the the inflight duty free shipping, we have tried on 4 different flights to buy a certain perfume which is listed in their catalog but it was not available as well as other male colognes listed.

Singapore Airlines is very dependable and the standards always high as is expected of a 5-star airline. The check-in counters are almost always free or have no more than one other guest in front of you. This is something I never take for granted and often a welcomed relief especially if I have travelled quite far to get to the airport. Knowing that check-ins can be done in under 5 mins from reaching the airport is an experience I've always looked forward to when flying with SQ, no matter which country I am in. The check-in staff are always pleasant and polite which sets the tone for the rest of the journey. The welcoming experience is often replicated at boarding when a senior cabin crew checks my boarding pass and welcomes me on board. SQ sets itself apart from the rest of the airlines by showcasing their best and possibly their most senior crew at the boarding area. The inflight entertainment offers an excellent selection of movies and shorter programmes. More importantly, Singapore Airlines allows passengers to use the inflight entertainment as soon as they are seated.

Lie down bed takes a bit of getting used to for set-up and pack away, but once you've got the hang of it, it's great. Helps you to sleep much more than when sitting. Meals were very nice and enjoyed book the cook options. The flight attendants felt the need to wake me for meals, even when I had put the Do Not Disturb button on. Perhaps they could say at the start of the flight when meals are expected, or allow you to choose a time within a certain range? The IFE was excellent with a good choice of recent and older movies. I found the headsets pushed into my ears, which got a bit sore after a couple of hours. I wear glasses, so that might be the reason. Amenities were available in the bathroom, although I didn't realise this until the second leg. Perhaps they should announce it or tell you upon boarding, rather than leaving you to wait for a kit?

Flight was on the A330 series, with 2-4-2 configuration. If travelling as a couple or pair, taking the window/aisle seats definitely gives you a sense of your own space, so this was a big plus. Legroom was reasonable. Service was up to the usual standards, although the most senior crew were sometimes a bit unsmiling. Food was average to good, depending on your choice, and the AVOD although not spanking new, was sufficient to entertain most for this 4 hour flight. The airplane is probably beginning to show it's age - it was a bit creaky and rattly on takeoff and landing, but everything is well maintained and perfectly comfortable.

Good champagne and extensive selection of beverages available upon request. Note of merit for the chamomile served along with pastries & chocolates selection. First flight on-time.

This time we took our adult daughter too - 'the shopper'. Unfortunately, all we saw of Changi was what we saw while running through the terminal, owing to our first connecting flight being delayed, then our second going tek and requiring us to change aircraft many hours later than our departure time. We were handed forms at the departure gate and an invitation to contact Singapore Airlines for future incentives. Infact, what we got in reply, months later, was in short: 'Safety first; we don't compensate for delays or connections - if missed' (all our flights were SQ). Tough luck. Therefore our experience of SQ is one we wouldn't recommend and as they state, they wash their hands of you if you miss a connection even in the event that connecting flights are both SQ. As a former employee of a British airline operating the very same aircraft I feel I have enough experience to say this is at best a poor outcome from SQ.

I have noticed a visible degradation in the quality of service over the years.  Ever since the introduction of the Premium Economy class, the quality of the service in the economy class has declined. The flight attendants go about their tasks mechanically, with little or no interaction with passengers. The food is mostly inedible. During my most recent flight, I opted for the Dim Sum breakfast between Hong Kong and San Francisco. The soggy, mushy items had no resemblance to Dim Sum items I have had anywhere. While US airlines such as Delta and United have vastly improved service for economy travelers, Singapore appears to be goading their economy passengers to upgrade to the significantly more expensive Premium Economy class.

It did not matter that I was adding Singapore Airline flights to my itinerary. It did not matter that I was only 2 hours past their 24 hour ‘deadline’ Since my Singapore Airlines flights were non-refundable I had no choice but to pay the $500 penalty.

In my opinion, the hard product that Singapore offers, as well as the crew is what makes them stand out from the rest. The seat and entertainment system are great - and the seat converts to a reasonably comfortable bed. For a bit of extra room, I'd recommend the first row (Row 11) of business as there is a bit more leg space. Food was good and as I had ordered book the cook, my choice was already taken care of and served promptly after takeoff. Wine selection was good and my glass was never empty. The A350 features inflight wifi and Singapore now offers 30Mb for free to business class passengers which worked well for me and provided just enough to check emails a few times during the flight. The standout was the exceptional level of service provided by the crew. Business class was fairly empty (only 10 seats occupied on this flight), but as it was an overnight flight, it would have been very easy for the crew to disappear.

"""surprised to discover how far SQ is behind""",7,Dexter Lee,11th February 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Singapore-Jakarta-Singapore in January. It's been 10 years since I flew Singapore Airlines and boy they've gone downhill since. Cabin service on both legs was really indifferent, especially on my evening flight back from Jakarta. Flown on many other airlines before but none except SQ offered me just ""coffee and tea"" during the meal service. Had to wait for another cabin attendant to pass by before I could get anything other than a hot drink. To a more discerning traveller it suggests cost cutting which is not cool. Inflight entertainment was mixed. Flight to Jakarta had one of the newest systems on the A350 but back home I was surprised to discover how far SQ is behind. No touch screen for the A330s in economy! Ground service was also a mixed bag - good in Singapore but underwhelming in Jakarta where my flight was delayed for almost an hour. No announcement and no apology until we we were all aboard. Can't fault their catering, which to my surprise was very good. Also, SQ android app is probably one of the best I've used and had no problem checking in for my flight on a phone.

Nice menu and small amenity kit. The crew seemed very nice and polite but a little robotic. No personalities. The food was ok, seats great because it’s still 9 across in Economy. Many other airlines are 10 across. Impossible to sleep due to the fact that the seat belt sign was turned on and off every 20 minutes and the captain and crew made really loud PAs. Now I understand that it’s a safety issue. Almost all other airlines have a faster seat belt message come up on your screen. By the 4th OA at 4 am I was ready to lose my cool.

Although the overall level of service is good there has been a decline in passenger facilities and comfort. Their Business class lounge in Chennai is a joke with about 20 seats in a small enclosure resembling a neglected warehouse. The seats on the Singapore - Los Angeles segment are flat beds but they are difficult to operate. Most people needed assistance from the flight attendants to switch between the flat bed and regular seating positions. Meals are ok but nothing great. The in flight entertainment is below average. There is the annoying halt for just over an hour in Tokyo where all passengers have to disembark and go through security before re-boarding the aircraft.

Singapore to Tokyo Narita.  Premium Economy Class Seats: Wider and well-cushioned. However, we were disappointed with quality. The buttons for recline and the foot rest was not working well. We actually had to force the foot rest out. This certainly isn't expected for Singapore Airlines (ANA on the contrary had everything in tip top condition). Entertainment: One of the airlines with the most decent entertainment. However, my headset was faulty. It was replaced but again, not expected. It should have been checked. Food: I used ""Book the Cook'. I expected the food to be better but found it so-so. Cabin crew took a really long time to clear the food. When I tried to return it, I was flatly rejected, the crew told me to wait. The entire process from start to end took 2 hours! It was crazy! SQ 633 was way much more efficient. Crew was pretty cheerful and the crew made the effort to confirm our meals with us before they took off. They surprised us with an anniversary cake as well. We like the customer engagement they provided. SQ 12 on the other hand appeared grouchy and unhappy to me - no confirmation on the food was made and they took so long to finish the meal service. Premium Economy has a cabin on its own. However, on both flights, the curtains were not drawn. We had passengers from Economy trying to sneak into the Premium Economy seats or use the toilets in Business Class. There were also kids (in Economy class) walking to and fro the Premium Economy cabins. This should have been controlled as my husband was trying to do some work on the plane and I was trying to rest but could not. While I try to be understanding on young children in the plane, it is definitely awful to have a child crying/screaming for 6 hours on a 7 hours flight. What made it worse was that seats with bassinets in the Economy class were directly behind the Premium Economy class. Overall, we were not very impressed with the quality of Premium Economy Class. Singapore Airlines have always been expected to be premium (along the lines with ANA/Qatar/Emirates). For the amount of money spent, I would very much go for ANA.",A350-900,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Singapore to Tokyo Narita,January 2018,4.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,3,no
"""The meals were very Asian""",3,Richard Connett,24th January 2018,"✅ Trip Verified |  Frankfurt to Singapore, Business Class. I got an email early morning on 9 January to notify me that the flight  was to be delayed by 2 hours. As I was connecting with Air New Zealand at Singapore onwards to Auckland with a short connection time, I thought the chance of catching the connecting flight to Auckland was going to be impossible. That proved correct. Prior to arriving at the airport, I rung both SQ and Air New Zealand. Both airlines claimed it was each other’s responsibility. In short, SQ was to blame for the disruption, so it was their responsibility to put things right. When we were due to board at Frankfurt, the A380 was not at the terminal, it was at a distant part of the airport so we were bussed to the plane which seemed to be miles away. When we finally arrived at the plane, we had to climb a set of steep stairs to enter the plane. Considering the delayed flight and the inconvenience we had been through, the greeting from the staff was very ho-hum. The crew seemed to be grumpy during this flight. The poor guy in front of me had a seat adjacent to the galley door way. He asked to be reseated somewhere else in the business section. The stewardess’s response was, sorry, we are fully booked. This wasn’t the case as there was a vacant seat behind me. The meals were very Asian, with a lot of seafood options, in some cases I chose to forego the course as there was just nothing I liked. I would recommend SQ’s “book the cook” option. There are far more options available using this than SQ offers on the flight. Come time to sleep, my bed was broken. It lay flat ok, its just that when I put my weight on the bed the feet end of the bed couldn’t sustain the weight and my feet would go right through to the floor. I slept, but it wasn’t great. I wasn’t the only one to complain of this problem. When the flight arrived in Singapore there were a team of SQ agents waiting for arriving passengers whose connecting flights were affected by the delay. In all fairness, SQ did handle this very well, they provided a 4 star airport hotel for 12 hours along with 3 meals. The journey on to New Zealand continued with SQ and I can basically say, I saw a repeat of the service issues I had on the Frankfurt/Singapore flight.

Complimentary 2 bag check in which was nice. Amenity kit provided complimentary containing tooth brush, paste, and socks. No slippers or eye mask as other airlines. Bathroom needed to be better maintained as waste bin was full by hour 4 out of 12 hour flight, soaps in disarray and bathroom prep tray (mouth wash etc). Special meal service was kind although a bit disappointing as you do not decide what meal you would like to eat but it is already prepared generic “western style” of whatever meal selection chosen. I would’ve loved to pick my meal with the changes applied, especially knowing tickets were booked ahead enough. Food was decent, but often the crew would overlook my seat and miss out several beverage//snack passes due to special needs. This was not at all an issue flying USA to Japan. But an issue on this flight. Main complaint is how crew could’ve done better to handle special requests with passengers. I booked and had a seat arranged, by surprise there were no shows in my row. Instead of privately making me aware of any request, an attendant publicly asked for my seating reassignment so that I may switch places with another passenger so that they my lie across the row with their bad knee. I’m partially deaf in one ear and spinal braced. Instead of privately requesting in writing, the crew member and requesting passenger makes a scene for me to move because I am unable to hear. So speaking louder while in flight should be better. There should be a better way for flight crew to handle those with special needs such as mute, deafness, and hidden disabilities instead of causing a scene or skipping passengers who cannot speak.

I decided to sleep through the long flight. Feeling cold, I tucked myself in with blankets. The middle seat person apparently had to exit his seat numerous times. Instead of exiting from his right, where a gentleman was seated,who was not sleeping, was not working, was not tucked in, nor was he sleeping, he decided to pass through my seat. Each time, I had to re-tucked myself in. At one point, he dropped my dessert and spilled my left over white wine over me.

Our seat had a blanket, pillow, IFE, coat hook and USB, we took off on time and once we were in the air, we were handed out the amenities kit which included socks, eye-mask and toothbrush. Food service started and the options were Turkey or Chicken sandwich, the man next to me did not want to eat but the crew insisted, I chose the Turkey sandwich and, it was amazing, my drink choice was coke, then I fell asleep. I woke up just in time for breakfast and the options were rice vermicelli or omelette. I chose the rice vermicelli which was OK, I had orange juice for my drink. We had a smooth landing in Singapore Changi T2 and had 30 minutes before boarding the flight to Jakarta. We just made our flight and I was given a window seat, I asked for a glass of water because I had run across the terminal and staff happily said yes and gave it to me with an ice cube, great start.

This means that the food trolley has to make a 45 degree turn into your cabin thereby making you move or be hit by the trolley every time. In fact they slammed the trolley into the arm of my chair every pass. You can only sleep if you encroach into the middle seat and cross your legs which we all know is a health hazard. The crew just grinned each time I was jarred awake. Only once did they say sorry. I complained and the airline said sorry it hasn't been an issue before.

My wife and I had a booking for March 2018 to fly Canberra Australia to Wellington New Zealand, one way. This relates to customer service pre-flight, not comfort or service on a flight. Booking was no problem and great price. Our dates were not flexible due to other commitments. We received notification that our flight was cancelled (by the airline) and we had the option to accept an alternative (suggested flights nominated) or decline. Choosing decline gave a direction to call their help line. Called the number and despite stating our case several times that as there was no suitable alternative we would request refund we kept being offered alternative dates. Finally our request was understood (we were dealing with a human) and we were told that the operator did not have authority to action that request and our request would be forwarded to another area who would get back to us ""soon"". When asked for a timeframe we couldn't be given one. Now, I would expect that as this was the airline making the change, and, knowing that choosing decline would generate calls to the help line, a professional outfit would have provided that option for operators to action. But, no. It took a follow up email and then a second phone call to finally be advised that our request to cancel was actioned. When asked when we could expect a refund in our account we are told up to four weeks!! And, no advice of the amount to be actually refund, we have to wait for it to turn up before we can be sure full refund.

I bought and paid for four preferred seats. I have replacement knees and whilst they slightly limit my mobility, they do not adversely impact on my upper body strength or general fitness. The preferred seats would have given me more leg freedom. I purchased the preferred seats on-line and disclosed that I had a mobility problem. The tickets were sold with full disclosure by me. On the flights, we were refused the seats. It was then explained to me that it was the decision of the Cabin Crew ""on the day"" whether a person could occupy the preferred seats or not. We were moved further back down (both) aircraft and other people were seated in the preferred seats at no cost to themselves. It seems that the cabin crew make a decision whether the people in preferred seats are fit enough to assist other passengers in the event of an emergency. A total farce really, because they do allow women with babies to utilise these spaces. (So much for being fit enough to assist) On the last flight, the senior Cabin Crew person indicated she was submitting a report to assist me in having the money returned. I wrote to Singapore Airlines in late August. My email was acknowledged, then no further contact was received. I rang the Sydney office today and was told the money would not be refunded because the Airlines has a ""Not Negotiable/No Refund policy on preferred seat sales.

I guess they are getting attacked by low cost airlines and Middle eastern airlines that have stolen many of their customers? Staff were efficient during the set times for service, but outside that this is a rather disappointing level of attention for business class. I had flown LAX to Tokyo one week earlier with ANA business class and have to say they are streets ahead of SIA from a service viewpoint. Seat on this A380 was comfortable, a little hard to sleep on, but quite private. Meals seemed quite small and dull compared to former standards. Used the inflight entertainment at beginning of flight and quite a nice choice. I probably wouldn't put them as first choice next time - they are a whole lot better than BA, but that is like comparing a low cost airline against SIA.",A380,Business,Business Class,Singapore to London,September 2017,4.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,3,yes

I had a Boeing 777 on the way in and A380 on the way back, and, since that was my first travel with the A380, I'll focus on this one. First of all, this plane is awesome! It's so massive and  super silent. I paid for the extra space seat, which turns out to not be a super good idea. You paiy for more leg room but got an entertainment system in the armseat that is less pleasant than the normal, so, I'd say that's not worth it. But, anyway, service was good, but not extraordinary. Food was not so good to be honest, I was a bit disappointed and the service was nice but, I didn't find anything that stands out compare to any other big airline in my opinion. Seat was ok, I could sleep without too much discomfort, entertainment system was fine, no complaints about it. In the end, I had two nice flights, I really enjoy them but, I didn't find that the Premium Economy in a 5 stars airline was much different that a 4 star one.

Boarding in Singapore is smooth, flights on time, even ahead of schedule, good choice of entertainment.

"""two great flights""",10,C Korkoran,31st August 2017,"✅ Verified Review |  Melbourne to Barcelona via Singapore, two great flights. Both cabins were the new Business fit out and the seats (11K and 11A respectively) were of the new set up. The only issue is that I think there is a lack of storage space, and no drink tray (which is available on the A380) The A350 arrangement is newer of course and the individual cabin seems a bit smaller than those on the A380 and B777 (although the seat is the same width as on the B777). In reality the size seems to be on a good scale and uses the space well - it is very comfortable and all works well, and very roomy. Interestingly we were handed a small amenities kit on the Singapore to Barcelona flight - a first in my experience with SIA. The service on both flights was top notch and the attendants very friendly and attentive. The A350 flight seemed to be full, but the service was of a very high standard. We had a short stopover in Milan where we had to remain on the plane and there was a crew change. One of the flight attendants came up to say goodbye as she was leaving the plane. Very personal service. The A350 is a terrific plane - very quiet (much more so than the B777) and very smooth. I did feel better after this flight than other long haul flights so maybe the extra humidity and air pressure and better air conditioning worked. Meals and drinks were of a high standard and the toilet to passenger ratio seemed good. The only slightly negative thing was the Silver Kris lounge in Singapore - very crowded, and the showers are showing their age.

I had booked the two flights on separate tickets as I had to add the trip to Kuala Lumpur on rather short notice. When booking the trip I took into account that the connection time in HKG was only 1 hour and 50 minutes between my SK flight and the Singapore flight. Being a frequent traveller with SAS I already asked to have my luggage checked through to Kuala Lumpur at Oslo airport, which was a very good choice as thus the SIngapore ground staff was prepared when the SK flight arrived in Hong Kong with a 80 minute delay. Despite I made it to the departure gate on my connection at last minute - exhausted after a long run through Hong Kong airport, the Singapore ground staff had already made a arrangement for me and my colleague to be booked on the next machine as the earlier flight had been anyway full. Both me and my colleague (who would not have made the connection as fast as me due to troubles at transfer security), we were both reassured, given new boarding passes and guided to the Singapore lounge for the next flight. All ground crew was very attentive and supportive and I appreciated this very foresighted arrangement, especially in the course that me and my colleague were actually booked on separate tickets.

The seat was large but very uncomfortable in seated and bed positions. The meal was not great and quality sub standard. The next flight out of Singapore to Melbourne while the aircraft was new was the biggest disappointment. The crew rushed both services and literally threw the table clothes and utensils down.

Boarding in Hong Kong is done very orderly, Premium economy customers get to use the channel for gold card members. Separate counter for check in, priority luggage handling, and a generous allowance of 35kg! On board I was warmly greeted and shown to my new seat. Very impressed by the design, seat pitch, and storage space etc. Out of HK we had a delay of 1 hour due to heavy traffic, but crew handled it perfectly, with drinks and snacks given out, and air con on. Sharing the same toilet of economy is no problem at all. We were even offered champagne and nuts, not bad at all! Meals were from economy, but we could also book the cook for a few extra special dishes. Metal cutlery, wine and drinks offered. Nice premium ice cream offered at the end of the meal. AVOD has a large screen, touch screen for 777 and normal use of console for A380. Wifi is available, although not cheap, but those who needs it will find it very useful.

The legroom was large, the seats were decently comfortable and in-flight entertainment system was excellent. Before taking off, the crew handed out hot towels and the menu, which was very nice. Shortly after take-off, the service began with a smaller snack before the stop in Moscow. Here, all passengers had to get off the airplane, even if you continued to Singapore. Moscow was an annoying but thankfully short stop. Be prepared to show your passport/bording pass 4-5 times though, as there were several controls, and one proper security checkpoint. Nothing insufferable, but annoying nonetheless. After taking off again from Moscow, the rest of the trip was a breeze. The service from the crew was excellent, with food, beverages and complimentary items. It was a 10 hour flight but it went by quickly thanks to the wonderful seat back entertainment system. There were more movies than you could ever hope to watch during a flight, as well as games, tv-series, books and music, all of it free! The only thing you had to pay for was the wifi. As such, I didn't check the cost, since I had enough free entertainment. As we began our descent the crew cleaned up nicely, and handed out the necessary immigration forms, if needed. The plane itself was only a few months old at the time and felt very modern. Everything looked stylish and clean. All in all, I am very impressed by Singapore Airlines economy class on this flight.

"""an inconsistent experience onboard""",7,Adler Tan,20th July 2017,"✅ Verified Review |  Flew from Jakarta to Singapore return. Our outbound leg was operated by a brand new A350. Despite the usually unremarkable ground service in CGK, we walked into the plane with high expectations, being known as a prestigious carrier here in Indonesia. Our previous flights with them has also been excellent. However, walking out of a Singapore Airlines plane for the first time in three years left us wanting for more. Sure, the A350 was an excellent aircraft in itself, with a spacious cabin, larger windows, high-tech LCDs for overhead signs and increased humidity, but unfortunately the flight experience overall has fallen miserably compared to our past flights with them as well as with competing airlines. Seat comfort was good but not great due to the hard leather headrests. Seat width was great, while pitch was nothing remarkable. Service was noticeably rushed, though crew were still professional, efficient and quite friendly. IFE was the most sophisticated and content-loaded I have ever experienced - complete with an extremely high resolution remote controller. However, it was not useful other than accessing shortcuts and viewing brief flight information. And then the food came: every single portion of the meal was lackluster - very severely below industry standards. Also, the ding sounds were played excessively throughout the flight, at an ear-splitting volume - they rung at least once every thirty seconds. How incredible. What's more, turbulence kept coming and going throughout the entire flight as well, and when it was time to land, we hit the ground very hard. Kudos to the pilot. The return flight was operated by a 16-year old 777-300, a stark contrast to the brand new A350 of the previous flight. However, this was much better: food quality was raised to industry standards - good, but not great, service was friendlier, but still far from the best out there, seat comfort was elevated thanks in part to the very soft and plush leather headrests; the constant ding sounds were replaced by an overall calmer ride interspersed with brief periods of turbulence. But what impressed me was the amount of space that each passenger in Economy Class receives: the amount of legroom was mind blowing. I could stretch out and still not feel claustrophobic. However, this flight also comes with its own share of flaws: crew service was not as efficient - they spent the first 20 minutes of cruise heating up food, and this caused my row to get the food only 30 minutes before arrival, and we finished our desserts as the plane was already midway through descent. Also, the IFE system is ancient and is in desperate need for a upgrade. The screens were also falling apart as well.

I was with a friend when I boarded this flight and going back to Singapore after a semester of studies in Perth. We just had a rude encounter with a staff at the boarding gate and was hoping to get a warm welcome from fellow Singaporeans on the SIA flight. However we were received with hostile treatment from the cabin staff serving us on the flight. Had to pass through 5 flight attendants before we finally got an apple juice. First 2 attendants conveniently missed us when serving drinks to other passengers. The next 2 forgot our orders. Throughout these 5 encounters, we were received with rude attitudes which irritated, annoyed and angered us. It was a truly frustrating flight. A flight attendant also missed me when serving meals, had to be served by another from the other aisle. Apart from that, in-flight entertainment was faulty, didnt bother to announce before rebooting and after restarting. My remote had 1 button missing. Meals were not hot and rice was hard.

I seriously wonder if the old cabin crew who had built up such a wonderful reputation for SQ had moved on to serve in Scoot.

"""not really impressive""",6, T Hanmer,30th June 2017,"✅ Verified Review |  London to Melbourne via Singapore. The premium economy is not really impressive. The seats are a bit bigger, but sometimes I feel like I'd rather have a window seat in economy and wedge myself into a comfort. It is handy if you want to do some work on your laptop during the flight, but not if you want to sleep. Singapore Airlines is a reasonable premium economy class option, but not as good as Qantas. The food is standard economy which I think should be expected. The extra money is paying for the seat. But I battled in it and didn't find the extra space that worthwhile.  The Wifi on SIA is an absolute joke. It was $10 for something like 50MB. I had to reload twice during the flight. Overall, I didn't think it was worth the price.

"""this flight was a terrible disappointment""",2,Richard Todd,21st June 2017,"✅ Verified Review |  My wife and I flew to London last week, with a Singapore stopover, choosing premium economy because we had a great experience flying on Qantas premium economy. We expected Singapore Airlines, another favourite carrier, to offer a similar product, and we had both had good Singapore Airlines flights before. But this flight was a terrible disappointment, and poor value for money. We are not looking forward to the return flight next month. With Singapore Airlines premium economy, you get a wider seat and better leg room. At the airport you check in separately, and there's a more generous luggage allowance. But that's all you get. We got the same food as economy (poor food compared to previous Singapore Airlines economy flights). The flight attendants served us and a large chunk of economy. Perhaps they were run off their feet: the only smiles were the neon-light style: turn on a smile and instantly turn it off again. When the food trolley came along there was a bottle of red and and a bottle of white wine on the top, but it was not offered. We were asked simply whether we wanted tea or coffee. I requested a glass of red, and was given it. I've no idea what sort of wine it was. The curried beef meal was poor economy class food at best, and far from what Singapore Airlines has offered in the past. Nobody came around after the meal to offer more wine, tea of coffee. After each meal, it took half an hour for anyone to come and remove our trays, so we were stuck in our seats and unable to go the toilet. My wife eventually lost patience and took her tray and returned it to the kitchen herself. Flight attendants were there, but offered no thanks or apology for the delay in retrieving the trays. On the long night flight leg to London a day later it was much the same. We were not even offered eye masks, though I was given one when I requested it. I've never flown an international night flight before when an eye mask wasn't offered. The curtain between premium economy and economy was never closed on either flight, and children from economy wandered into our aisle at will. As we approached London, our last meal was a breakfast omelet of rubbery texture, which seemed to underscore the whole mediocre experience this premium economy flight had been. But it hadn't finished yet: On arrival at Heathrow, people in economy poured from their seats into our part of the aircraft before the seatbelt light had been turned off. No flight attendants told them to stay in their seats until those ahead of them had got off, not even a cabin announcement. Most cabin announcements during were barely audible, even in an aircraft as quiet as an A380, so that might not have made much of a difference. To sum up: we used to praise Singapore Airlines to the skies, but the scales have fallen from our eyes.This was an appalling way to start our holiday, and it will take a lot to get us to return to flying with this airline again.",A380,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Sydney to London via Singapore,June 2017,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1,no

My wife and I booked two seats from Madrid to Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam. We had a big drama at the airport in Munich because 20 min before departure their ground crew decided to asked us for a return flight from Vietnam. We had the approval letter from the Vietnamese Immigration letter which was shown to them. The only requirement is to have the approval letter and pay for the visa on arrival. This information was co-overrated by the Immigration department in Vietnam upon our arrival to HCMC. It is also important to note that this wasn't our first time in Vietnam and no airline staff has ever asked us for an outgoing flight. What really makes me angry though is that their ground crew left it to the very last minute to ask us for the return flight. It was an incredibly stressful booking a flight on the spot, only having 10 minutes or so to do it. We almost missed our flight because of their incompetence. To make matters worse the cabin crew was incredibly rude and unpleasant. One of the staff members didn't even bother to use the word please. How can these people work in the travel/tourism industry? On arrival to Vietnam, we found out that both of our suitcases were damaged.

"""improve the overall pleasantness""",4,M Gerten,27th May 2017,"✅ Verified Review |  Hong Kong to Surabaya via Singapore. I have been flying with Singapore Airlines in Economy a couple of times in the past and was under the impression that I really like flying with them. However, my recent two legs felt mediocre at best and made me question my general stance. The crews seemed disorganized, very mechanic, and provided slightly chaotic and/or unnecessary stressed meal services. The first beverage service consisted of pre-filled cups with wine and beer served from a tray that the FA carried through the aisle. Kinda strange. Why not hand out little wine bottles (as Lufthansa does) and cans of beers instead? If no one takes the cups, do they pour them out? The planes were fairly old, featuring ancient inflight systems. I also dislike with Singapore Airlines that during online set selection, one is only being shown very few available seats - and when you sit down, the seats that were shown occupied suddenly are empty, while the one next to you which was shown available is occupier. I understand that there always are last minute changes but I still notice a repeating pattern; with other airlines (within Star Alliance) I usually am able to make smarter seat choices than when flying with SIA. The food was good. Overall, if Singapore Airline wants to maintain its position as a serious premium airline, it has to improve the overall pleasantness of the flight experience. The fare was not cheap (yet the booking class made it hard to earn miles outside of Krisflyer), and mediocre doesn't justify a significant higher price than what the low cost competion offers.",Boeing 777-200 / A330-300,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Hong Kong to Surabaya via Singapore,May 2017,4.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,3,no

Usually they start their way form the front to the back but this time one section within the economy cabin started from the front and the other from the back. By the time they have reached my seat, they said there was no more choices so I had to take what was left. Furthermore, on the meal tray itself, my salad or appetiser food container had no cover. Since the crew on my section was so slow; therefore, they expected us to finish our meal so fast so they could clear up. I have traveled with them a lot and I have been in business class.

The flight from Hong to Singapore (SQ871) was delayed about 30 minutes and therefore arrived Singapore 10 minutes later than scheduled. Yet my next flight from Singapore to Brisbane (SQ255) was going to depart in about 40 minutes. It was so a rush to transfer flight in such short period of time.

However, no further detail was given and I was not sure where and who to talk to. The flight from Singapore to Brisbane is about 8 hours which would give their staff plenty of time to communicate between Singapore and Brisbane offices about my luggage.

My suggestion is that if the crew is aware that on board wifi is not available for the initial part of the HKG-SIN as apparently the networks are not that great.

It is fine for a day time flight but having flown this at night previously is not good for a refreshing sleep. Check in was a bit slow and rude, being directed by one staff member to a check in agent who put up her hand to my face to indicate for me to stop while she did something else. Lounge was basic but all I wanted was a coffee. Flight left on time, brunch and snacks were both tasty, of a high quality and large in size. Quality of coffee on board was excellent, too. Crew were great and the wine was good. Attempted a couple of hours sleep which was not great due to the seat.

"""nothing was offered voluntarily""",6,M Kitts,24th March 2017,"✅ Verified Review |  Flew roundtrip on Singapore Airlines new nonstop route between San Francisco and Singapore in Premium Economy on the outbound and regular Coach class upon returning. The premium seat was decent, but I wasn't as impressed with the rest of the setup or the soft product. With the hard partition toward business class in front, and the service area / galley located well to the rear past an economy section, the premium economy area on this aircraft is a virtual dead-end rarely patrolled by flight attendants. On the SFO-SIN sector, received two meals during the 16h20m flight, with no other proactive service - no separate drink runs prior to the meals either. You had to press the call button for anything, mid-flight snacks were available but again, nothing was offered voluntarily. Flight attendants seemed to do what was required but without a smile. No landing cards handed out. Except for the seat itself, the service on the return flight SIN-SFO in regular Economy was actually better, with a pre-lunch drinks run (from a tray, not a full cart) and follow-up hot beverage service after the meal. As with the outbound flight, however, the second meal service - a breakfast - took place about six hours before landing, what gives? The check-in experience at SFO was ok, but at SIN economy passengers are herded toward self check-in kiosks and self baggage tagging whether they like it or not. I have only flown SIA once before, but based on my limited experience with them so far, I wouldn't go out of my way to fly them - although I would chose them again if they offered a convenient schedule at a decent price point.",A350,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,San Francisco to Singapore,March 2017,4.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4,yes
"""cabin crew seemed almost robotic""",5,P Hughes,23rd March 2017,"✅ Verified Review |  First time with Singapore Airlines. Got to Sydney airport early. Checked in online and dropped bags. Friendly ground crew directed me to Business Class check in counter as the online check in counter was busy with another passenger. No issues and was issued boarding pass seamlessly. Boarding at Gate 61, a bit chaotic as there are very few seats in that part of the airport for all passengers on a full A380. Departure delayed one hour due to bad weather but was handled professionally by captain and was able to make my connection in SIN. Meal ok, but cabin crew seemed almost robotic, rehearsed and fake. Lacked human touch and could probably be replaced by a few well programmed robots. Seat 60K in economy. After sometime realized my back was aching. Discovered that seat had no lumbar support, some did, mine didn't and couldn't fully recline either. Not pleasant for a 7 hour flight to SIN. Didn't bother complaining as crew was nowhere to be found after meal service and were happy to switch off lights and disappear. Entertainment system, a bit dated, probably the original system used with the first A380 flights and some buttons required a harder press on the remote as had been worn out. Had about 200 movies but I mostly listen to music while flying. Choice of music was mediocre, so decided to use my iPod instead. No free WiFi quota. Same continued on SIN-CMB leg except seat had lumbar support this time, didn't turn on entertainment system this time.

The service is great, a regular drink tray with waters and juices being brought to you to keep you hydrated. The food was decent for economy class standards and they also offered a small snack (sandwich) and second meal. A small amenity pack was provided and consisted of a toothbrush and socks - nothing special but still a tick in the box which some airlines have cut back on. The headrest of the seat is comfy and is made of leather which gives it class. Ambient lighting during the night hours gave a relaxed and upmarket feel. The best part of the Economy seat was the entertainment system which consisted of a large screen - bigger than an iPad size and then has a small digital control below; it all works well and is also touchscreen and the quality and size is better than I've seen on BA business 747.

Unfortunately this flight has no WiFi despite it being a B777-300ER plus flying out at 0700 one would expect a little breakfast. Sadly there was no meals until 12 noon Singapore time which means about 3pm Sydney time. I overheard an American passenger asking for some food as he was hungry.

"""Service lacked enthusiasm""",6,Viral Ladhani,28th February 2017,"✅ Verified Review |  Singapore to Munich, and travelled this sector twice within 6 months so my review is based on mix of both. Boarding at Changi is consistent and zone wise boarding. Check-in staff, passport and boarding card checks are very friendly. On boarding the flight crew looked less enthusiastic then I know of. There was a sense of disorganisation. The senior crew jetted through cabin with a frown and certainly created a negative environment. Once in the air, meal and drink service was conducted. I use book the cook service and was served about 30 mins before fellow passengers which I find bit awkward. Again, the meals can be elabotate for this class but I found portions are small and not filling. Service lacked enthusiasm, warmth and smile on both the sectors and cabin crew were indifferent. Some were good and some were kind of forced to work. SIA provides good entertainment system so while watching movies, I decided to get a snack from middle galley and crew were friendly but didn't see them throughout the flight atleast on my side of aisle. On one of the flight, I asked for a coffee and it was brewed very strong even by European standards with the reason given that Europeans only drink strong coffee. The crew in back galley were sad and angry. On the positive side, SIA 777-300 has spacious toilets. Entertainment system is good and seat is spacious enough for the class. All in all, MUC flights are out of Singapore Airlines pattern. I read review of another passenger in this forum also travelling to MUC and found to be negative.

"""generous seat width""",10,J Choo,24th February 2017,"✅ Verified Review |  Singapore to New York via Frankfurt. I have flown the SIN-NYC route 4 times in the last 15 months. In my earlier trips, I flew with a large European carrier and two different Middle Eastern carriers. I last flown SQ on this route over 8 years ago so I can compare the recent experience with that from 8 years ago. The main thing to me that distinguished SQ service from competitors is cabin crew service. One thing which I felt was lacking though is the smiles that SQ's crew used to be famous for. Some of the more senior staff still has that touch and could make a positive impression but increasingly, I noticed in my last 8 or so flights on SQ in the past 12 months, that the crew are no longer as at ease or friendly as they used to be. A small minority seem a little indifferent which drags SQ reputation down. Their service adds a shine to the brand even though the hardware is not as impressive as the Middle Eastern carriers. A380 feels older compared with the B787s and A350s that many airlines are now using. Despite the older planes, I find the generous seat width a life saver. Other details include lights under the IFE screens which gave good coverage for each passenger's immediate area but do not disturb surrounding passengers. Another detail is the foot pedal activated trash bins in the toilets, helps not having to push the bin's lids using our hands. There was good crew presence throughout the entire flight. The food portion is generous and quality better than other carriers I have flown. I can't wait to experience the A350 on this route, and hopefully the cabin crew will be better trained and motivated.",A380,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to New York via Frankfurt,February 2017,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4,yes

After meals, they served ice cream but missed on me, where a crew assured that they are not offering it to me since I am vegetarian and ice cream contains gelatine. Since it was a day flight, crew was actively anticipating needs and were very busy serving to a group of very demanding passengers in economy. This flight had dedicated crew for Premium Economy and they came around at least 3 times to assure if everything is fine. Many rounds of snacks in a basket and drinks on tray and crew looked enthusiastic, service minded and very friendly. We were made to feel like welcomed guests. I walked to see economy class, the crew were happy to chat about A350 product.  The aircraft by itself is very quiet, quieter than B787 and toilets are spaciously planned and were kept clean.

I've flown Singapore Airlines in Economy Class long haul several times and been satisfied. On this occasion I decided to opt for Premium Economy. I was flying from Auckland to London via Singapore but the first leg was on Air New Zealand, and I recommend their Premium Economy service. Singapore Airlines seats have a bit more space and legroom than Economy, and the in-flight entertainment screens are bigger, but otherwise everything was identical to Economy class. I'm a vegetarian and I had the exact same two meals I had in Economy class three weeks earlier, and I didn't enjoy them the first time around. My companion ordered the ""book the cook"" and his meals seemed better quality, but none of the available options were vegetarian. For the breakfast service they completely forgot to offer us a drink. The service was bored and impersonal throughout, the flight attendants were rushing around and didn't smile. The toilets are shared with Economy class. For sleeping I didn't find the seats significantly more comfortable than regular Economy and the fixed central console means you can't stretch out over any adjacent empty seats. That said I'm only 5'3"", my 6'1"" companion did appreciate the extra legroom. The entertainment selection is extensive and the noise cancelling headphones good. However, we were in the front bulkhead seats and the screens were set on the wall ahead of and were too high for comfortable viewing, there are also irritating advertisements ahead of each programme.

A recently renovated 777-300 was exceptionally comfortable and provided the basis for an excellent trip if only the crew had cared. All crew members were well presented as always but those serving my part of the cabin showed a low level of enthusiasm about their jobs. It started with a 40 minute wait for a glass of wine and water, there was a similar 40 minute wait for a coffee in the morning. Offered a regular meal as opposed to the special meal I had pre-ordered at both dinner and breakfast, indicated that they weren't paying much attention. Not called by name once, just ""sir"" with a half hearted apology at dinner re the offer of the initial meal and then when asked if I would like desert a pointed response to me when asking what it was, being told ""I have no idea, you ordered a special meal"". Dinner was very watery as I don't think that the water from the vegetables had been drained and so the gravy was more like a soup. Breakfast omelette was cold. After I asked for the regular cereal to be taken away, I think that they began heating the special meal I had ordered only at this point. When it was served 10 minutes later half of it was cold to the point of being refrigerated. Not offered water between meals, had to go to the galley each time. While not the fault of the airline, it was topped off by a nearly two hour wait at customs. There was no immigration officer at the ""crew only"" queue and the crew went through our queue so they were off long before the passengers. We were behind a very slow moving contingent of Air China passengers. By the time I got to the baggage so much time had elapsed our flight was no longer listed and had to go to the Lufthansa bag desk to find out which carousel to go to.

Boarding began in time and orderly, zone wise boarding which helped in quick boarding and we left within 25 minutes considering it was a fairly full flight. We were greeted by delightful and genuine crew. The aircraft was clean and business class is the best I have seen. Premium economy seats are very comfortable with lots of options to store gadgets, charging point, usb port and big hd screen with many options. As soon as we were airborne, hot towel service followed by snack and drink followed by meals. I used the cook the book service, passengers using such option are served first, this doesn't allow you to dine with your fellow passengers unless you wait. Usual meal service was hurried and crew seemed to be in stress as economy in back was completely booked out. The meal by itself was okay. For premium economy I would have expected to be elaborate. Trays were collected after a while and rolled down service. After some hours I tried thier snack service, crew delightfully greeted and opened snack options and gave me more than requested. Fresh fruits, sandwiches, chocolate waffles and crisps. The crew was also courteous enough to inquire if they could do anything so that I can sleep for a while. I also noticed that crew went through cabin couple of times to anticipate our needs. Although captain announced turbulence and turned on seatbelt sign, crew walked through cabin with torch to check seat belts and ensured we fasten it.

"""service was slow and disappointing""",1,S Claezer,11th February 2017,"✅ Verified Review |  Perth to Munich via Singapore. This is a review of the flight SQ328 from Singapore to Munich on 10th February. The ordeal started in Singapore. While the flight was not marked as delayed, the departure time had been pushed back by 35 minutes on the airport screens. When I inquired, the answer was that ""we are using the first available aircraft"". Nice indeed. Singapore Airlines obviously works under the premise that changing departure times because of missing aircraft does not mean a delay. The flight boarded in accordance with the displayed delayed departure time. However, once on board, nothing happened at the departure time. No announcements were made. After inquiring again, the captain condescended to make an announcement that he was waiting for other passengers to join the flight. When inquiring a 3rd time what additional time we would be looking at, I got told that the captain is unable to tell. After an estimated 15 additional passengers had come in during additional 45 minutes of waiting, the aircraft finally taxied out to the runway. However, while several other aircraft passed us and took off, we were sitting in a parking spot next to the runway. This time an announcement was made that we ""have a few aircraft ahead of us"" - after about 20 minutes, the captain told us that his flight plan had expired and the route to Munich had been closed because of the long time we waited for other passengers. The result was that we had to taxi back to the gate from which we had left, in order to get a new flight plan and refuel the aircraft. This exercise cost another hour. In summary, it may be justified to wait for connecting passengers from delayed flights. However, the captain should have communicated honestly and, in particular, never taxied out to the runway. It is unprofessional and proves utmost incompetence to do this without a robust flight plan. He could have easily obtained an adjusted flight plan while we were sitting at the gate waiting for the connecting passengers from delayed flights. His lack of planning and anticipation skills are very concerning from a passengers's view. What does the guy do if anything unforeseen happens in the air? To add to the picture, the aircraft was worn, old and super noisy. The service in the back of the cabin was slow and disappointing when compared to previous Singapore Airlines standards. This was the second encounter of disappointing Singapore Airlines service in four flights on my recent trip. Things seem to go south at Singapore Airlines. In general, I question the justification of SQ having a five star airline rating.",Boeing 777,Business,Economy Class,PER to MUC via SIN,February 2017,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2,no

My husband flew straight home from Laos but the rest of us - myself and our 3 teenagers - decided to stay in Singapore for 4 nights. I would have thought the national airline would be encouraging passengers to stay and spend money in their country. We were charged an extra $437.50 per person to do this. On emailing and phoning the airline on several occasions the explanation given was the flights were a different code. With further enquiry I was told that departure tax was part of the cost. This, when asked, amounted to about $30 each!

"""worth the extra ... I don't think so""",5,W Larkham,29th January 2017,"✅ Verified Review |  Sydney to London Heathrow via Singapore. I normally fly China Southern business class from Sydney to London and I pay for the tickets myself as I fly to the UK to see my parents and family. This year my father turns 90 in February so I am flying to London twice this year and in order to save $2000 I decided that one flight had to be an economy one. Not being able to face true economy I booked a Premium economy seat with Singapore Airlines. I have flown Premium economy with other airlines over the years, Qantas, BA and Virgin Atlantic (when they still flew to Oz). Firstly having booked the ticket with an online travel agent I went on to the Singapore Airlines internet site and was able to select my seat and Book the Chef meals. 10 out of 10 for their on-line presence, easy to use compared with China Southern which is a nightmare. At the airport no queue for the dedicated Premium economy checkin. Staff member very polite. No lounge access but Sydney Airport has plenty of places to sit comfortably and is not too busy. Boarding was a breeze as Premium economy have priority with Business and First. On the plane the FAs were all smiles and assisted passengers with their luggage and that's something I haven't seen for a while. Boarding was swift on both sectors, the captains introduced themselves and we left on time. Soon after the seat belt sign went off the drinks were served. I prefer being given a minature gin and can of tonic rather than just being served it in a glass. Also no slice of lemon. The meal service came next all served on one tray. The quality of the food was good, but very small and no different from economy. Throughout the flight FAs came around with water and if a passenger wanted a drink or snack they were provided. The FAs were always polite and friendly and came when requested. I never drink much alcohol when flying so the water was adequate. we arrived early on both sectors, disembarkation was quick. My flight cost A$3100 return, an economy ticket on the same flights A$1300, a China Southern Business Class ticket A$4800 if booked at the same time. So there is the rub was it worth it. Well yes and no. The seat is more comfortable, even with the seat in front fuly reclined I still had space, the screen is large and clear and the available entertainment exhaustive. The problem arises when the Singapore Airlines product is compared to the likes of Qantas, it just doen't feel special. There are no seperate toilets, the food is the same as economy, during the flight the curtain between Premium economy and economy is not even closed. In other words all you are buying is a bigger seat with more space, an ecomomy plus rather than a Premium Economy and is that worth the extra A$1800. I don't think so. If I could have my time again I think I would either spend the extra A$1700 and fly business with China Southern or have stopped over on each direction with $1800 to spend on hotels and entertainment.",,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,SYD to LHR via SIN,January 2017,4.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,1,yes

"""the seats were spacious""",8,M Sanders,22nd January 2017,"✅ Verified Review |  I flew on Singapore Airlines (SQ) from Sydney to Chennai via Singapore last December. This was my first time on SQ and was quite excited about the journey as I had heard a lot about them. General: All my flights were on-time infact some arriving a bit earlier. The seat allocation in manage booking was restrictive when compared to competitors. I wanted to allocate a window seat and it was showing as all the seats were taken. Luckily when I checked-in, it showed one window seat on each sector and I was able to take it. Not sure why SQ should make it complicated. I do understand they have to block some seats to cater to their frequent flyers etc.. but that doesn't mean you block the whole flight. Value for money: The ticket prices are on the higher side compared to competitors. However, I am willing to pay for quality hence I would opt for SQ. Ground service: Ground staff in both Sydney and Singapore were friendly and the check-in process was smooth. Seat comfort: The seats were spacious. Though I am average sized I felt even a bigger person would be able to sit comfortably. Cabin staff service: Cabin crew are one of the friendliest in the world. Prompt service. My only disappointment was when a request was made for some additional alcoholic drink (within usual limits in a competitor), I got a feeling that the crew were not enthusiastic. I am not sure whether this is due to the airline policy or it was the cabin crew's perspective. Also when you request a spirit, its taken like a special order which will come after a while. Ideally they are supposed to have it along with the other drinks (like other competitors do) and should be served instantly. Food & beverages: The quality of food was excellent. The quantity could be a bit more but I will live with it. Inflight entertainment: One of their weakest points. In this current era of touch screens, we have to use remote control on both their A380 and A330-300 fleet. Also the choice of movies are very limited, a cheap take-away earphone and outdated software. I wouldn't mind if they provide a better headset and collect it at the end of the flight. I have read that their retrofitted B777-300ER and A350-900 come with touch screens. But that doesn't help anyone as A380 and A330-300 still forms a bulk of their fleet and are deployed on key routes. As an aviation enthusiast I used to enjoy the onboard camera with a competitor, unfortunately its not available on SQ. Cabin Wifi: The rates are really expensive when compared to some of the competitors. It didn't also work for a good part of the journey. I am aware there are restricted zones but I have flown on the similar route with another competitor and haven't had much issues with the Wifi. Overall, I would fly Singapore Airlines again and hopefully some of the above issues may be resolved with more A350's being delivered.",A380 & A330-300,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,SYD to MAA via SIN,January 2017,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4,yes

"""SQ have really dropped the ball""",3,G Dodd,5th January 2017,"✅ Verified Review |  Melbourne to London return via Singapore. Have always Singapre Airlines with high regard until my most recent trip to London. When we booked in January 2015, we could not book premium economy on the MEL to SIN leg, as at that time there was no premium economy on this leg. This has now changed but only on some flights. MEL to SIN in Economy, an older plane with inflight entertainment screen to boot. The screen was awful, so if you flying on another SIA flight, hold back and watch the movies you want to watch on a better screen. Service was very average, IFE was poor, food was very poor. Singapore to London in Premium Economy The only advantage in taking premium economy is the seat pitch and thats it. This is a very poor attempt at premium economy and it is a complete rip off. Inflight entertainment was poor, a much larger screen, so great for movies, the only plus. My small hand held control panel did not work. The entertainment system kept resetting itself at the end of every movie or programme. One ear in the headphones did not work. Service was poor - In premium economy you are placed in front of economy and behind business class. The service is provided by the economy cabin staff. Could not call for service as my hand held control panel did not work. The toilets are down in economy, none near premium economy. Food was very Poor -  Economy class food. The only reason why I've given a score of 2 is because they have the book the cook service, but that is still economy class standard food. Remember, you are paying double the price for this seat. Flight arrived 25 minutes late. Return legs London to Singapore in premium economy was exactly the same but this time the entertainment system kept resetting itself, the headphones worked and so did the hand held control panel. Singapore to Melbourne in Economy - the breakfast on economy is as poor as you get with airline food. A cold bread roll, hard cold butter, cold muffin, cold unripe fruit.  The TV screen on this plane was up to date but still had issues with it freezing. We had a seat between us, so basically it was the same as flying premium economy but without paying twice the price. I had made a complaint to SQ a month before flying and this complaint has not been responded to. On all counts SQ have really dropped the ball.

We got the middle seat to ourselves in economy which made the 16.5 hour journey quite pleasant. The nicest part of this flight is the actual aircraft. The A350 makes such non stop flights easy on the body. A plus for Singapore Airlines for including this in their fleet. Service standards are good, but quite often I feel that SQ have a pretty rushed and least patient service on the San Francisco route. The cabin was overall clean but there was some muck above my window which I had to clean. Biggest disappointment was when I asked for the Singapore immigration card and the crew member told me they hadn't brought any on the flight. 2 hours later another crew member started offering them.

The seat configuration is 2-4-2 and there are no toilets specifically for Premium Economy. Rather than a separate cabin curtained off, Premium Economy is just the front section of the economy section. The seats were functional and inflight entertainment good but seat pitch is less than Air NZ. The food was terrible. We used the ""book the cook"" option on the return flight and this was no better, though they did manage to accomodate an allergy in our group.

If you book on line make sure to read all 20 pages of the Terms and Conditions. I have been an Elite Gold KrisFlyer member for 15 years and have previously considered Singapore Airlines as one of my preferred airlines. Not any more. All I wanted to do was buy an Economy Class ticket and use points to upgrade to business class (my daughter was the passenger). So I went on line and selected the cabin class that allowed upgrades. The web site showed a tick that this was possible and the ticket that I subsequently purchased likewise confirmed that class E tickets are eligible for upgrades. What they don't tell you is that upgrades are only permissible to the next available cabin class and that as most international flights have a Premium Economy cabin you can not upgrade from regular economy to business class. This little known rule is buried deep in the terms and conditions (section F, para 24, sub section a)) which almost nobody ever reads, it is 20+ pages long.

Days after making the reservation well in advance (through Orbitz), I was notified of a minor change in schedule. No problem. A couple of days later I received another change, this one a 22 hour flight delay requiring almost a full extra day of travel spent in Singapore. Singapore Airlines policy gave me these choices: Accept the change (ridiculous), or provide them with 3 alternatives in order of preference. They then choose which one you will fly. The passenger cannot choose and have that choice confirmed. Or cancel the ticket (full refund) and start over. In this case, no other same-day flight Singapore to Chiang Mai was available, so the alternatives reduced to an extra connecting flight through Bangkok, losing 2 hours, or extra connecting flight through Bangkok, losing 4 hours, or connection through Hong Kong and losing approximately 15 hours in transit.

I was compensated only with another economy class seat and SGD 15 meal voucher that I can only redeem at limited number of food outlets at Changi airport, and most of them are too random (food not looking good at all). They have been also been doing this cost cutting in the economy class meals by not giving appetizers anymore. FAs never happy when I order some special drinks even though they are on the menu. If SIA wants to do some cost cutting or what not, they should have made it less obvious, especially to loyal customers, otherwise loyal customers will look for other cost-effective Star Alliance carriers.

The seat on the return leg on the upper deck of the A380 was so comfortable I had to be woken for breakfast. It was on the return leg that this airline really impressed me. At Singapore there was a technical problem with the A380 slotted to fly us back to Sydney. We were advised immediately and reallocated to another gate where within an hour, the entire passenger list was boarded onto another A380 and we departed 1 hour late. Who has a 'spare' A380 with flight crew ready to go with passengers boarded in 60 minutes? They also made up the time and landed us in Sydney ahead of schedule by about 5 minutes. This is a very impressive performance and one that some other airlines might seek to emulate. We flew Air New Zealand to San Francisco in May and a technical fault in Sydney saw us trapped in the airport for 8 hours, miss our connection in Auckland and lose a day out of our trip.

On boarding the aircraft with my cane I was told where my seat was, and nothing else. I had no access to safety instructions or menus. No access to entertainment system, no knowledge of where toilets were and no access to help button. I did not know how my chair worked. I was completely ignored on the outbound flight. A complaint was made and I was advised my return flight I would be made comfortable, that I would have my needs taken into account. This was not the case, again the seating was not appropriate even though promised. Singapore Airlines did not fulfill their commitment to make ""reasonable adjustments"" to ensure my safety or comfort onboard their aircrafts. I could not see or hear as both main flights were night flights. I could not use the toilets as I wasn't told where they are. The crew outbound had no concern for my safety or comfort.

Departure airport was quiet that day due to industry-wide strike. Anticipating delay and congestion, somehow I checked-in and cleared custom in a breeze, which was quite a surprise. Orderly boarding accompanied by cabin crews repeated welcomes, no one has rushed and despite the rear cabin being full, it remained quiet throughout the journey. I had prepaid extra for the Preferred Seat 48A on-board the new A350 with almost unlimited leg room - there's no seat in-front, thus moving in or out of the seat without disturbing fellow passengers alone was worth paying extra for. However, the seat does come with its own design flaws. Once the PTV is pulled up, it physically creates a wall in between 48A and 48B, not only reducing 48B's already limited personal space, it also made plugging in USB charger an additional hassle. Furthermore, reduced seat width and immovable armrest are just another two trade-offs if extra leg room is preferred. Nevertheless, the amount of seat recline did appear adequately generous. The flight took about 7 hours, there were two meals served - one dinner and another light meal. The size and taste of its meals have noticeably deteriorated over the years, e.g., the size of the tray has been reduced significantly, just to name one.

The flight to Kolkata was a red eye and pretty tiring one, but I asked the flight attendant if she could serve me hot chocolate after I wake up.

"""marginally superior to Economy""",1,Antony Champion,24th October 2016,"✅ Verified Review |  In September / October 2016 I flew with my wife around the world using in sequence Virgin Atlantic, Air NZ and Singapore Airlines. All in Premium Economy. The principal airline booked was Air NZ and their service in Premium Economy was excellent. Unfortunately our flights from Auckland to London via Singapore were very poor. The standard of Singapore Airlines Premium Economy was inferior to Air NZ and to a lesser extent Virgin Atlantic. Singapore Airlines Premium Economy is marginally superior to Economy class and vastly inferior to their Business Class. During the first hour of my flight from Singapore to London I made my concerns known to the senior cabin steward. He made a mental note but did nothing to show any reparation for the poor service except that he admonished his junior staff for serving wine in clear plastic beakers as opposed to the glass beakers provided alongside the plastic foil-topped water on the food tray. He explained that Singapore Airlines were relatively new to offering Premium Economy class. No welcoming drink, no menu in seating area, alcoholic beverages served in plastic cups, meals of appallingly poor standard, coffee disgustingly bitter, wines of a poor standard. Apparently champagne was available but it was not offered to passengers and I only became aware of it after a chance conversation with cabin staff while waiting to use the bathroom. Singapore Airlines offers very little in terms of Premium service in its Premium Economy cabin service.

"""disappointed how this was handled""",7,Petra Hublot,19th October 2016,"✅ Verified Review |  I had a delayed flight from Tampa (on JetBlue), scheduled initially at 4.30pm but delayed to 5.06pm in taking off at 5.35 pm to JFK with a connection flight to Frankfurt on Singapore Airlines at 8.55pm which I of course, missed by the time I got to the other Terminal and through security. I was stranded at JFK a bit after 9.00pm because at the counter at the gate was no one anymore and the tiny booth is only occupied a few hours at odd hours per day. So I called the 1-800 # on my booking confirmation and was told that they would put me on the very next flight at 8.55am, yes the person said am! But as all offices are closed now I will get a confirmation call once they open the next morning! Learned later that they are in San Francisco, 3 hours behind us. So I went back to the other Terminal to the help desk of JetBlue, which had the delayed plane - after more than an hour with several phone calls I finally got a room in an hotel for the night, I finally made it after midnight into my room. The next morning I rushed to the Airport only to learn that there is no am flight ! The flight is apparently daily at 8.55 pm. I couldn't believe what I was told on the phone. I already spent a short night without my luggage or personal belongings and fresh clothes and now I had to sit another 12 hours around. Once the booth from Singapore Airline was occupied at 2.55 pm I told them about my dilemma and he called his supervisor to find out if I could reschedule my flight back from FRA, Germany to JFK : instead of Oct. 03, 2016 to one or two days later because of my lost 24 hours here at the Airport. Nope, nothing to do, because I already have gotten an hotel room for the night ! Unbelievable, I would have slept in a corner at the Airport they would have rescheduled my flight back home?

Wow there really is - I discovered - not a great deal of consistency with SQ apart from the service routine. HCMC to Singapore I had the best meal on a flight ever. Tender pork in gravy with thin sliced fried potato and onion. Was so good. The entertainment was appalling in that the screen was too dark to even see, even with lighting altered and the screen tilted, blinds down. Anyway we got there safely and being just a 2 hr flight it was fine. Leaving Singapore on SQ 227 at 9.20pm. Full flight. Going through security at the gate itself. Boarded in sections but no one abided by that and they were not enforced which makes for a shambles. Paid for exit row seats. Nowhere to store anything. My husband tried to find an overhead locker but the lady in the aisle two seats down refused to share. Her carry on was horizontal in it and she had another small bag. Got upset when my husband tried to put her bag vertical. Was ignored by FAs. Found somewhere finally, but if you do go for the exit row you will be last off as you can't get back to where your bag is. Nowhere for my handbag. I got it stuffed under my own seat via the front. There was a baby in the infant seats but was really good, very attentive parents, I was impressed. Singapore has got the meal service wrong here too. At 9.20pm you are faced with a proper dinner which a snack would suffice as most have had dinner by then. Breakfast was a roll, muffin and a little bit of fruit.

Blankets, pillows, etc, are top quality, though no amenities pack as usual with Singapore Airlines, but there's stuff in the nice bathrooms. New 18"" screen was fantastic, though I find the range of watching and listening on Singapore Airlines somehow terribly middle of the road and safe. Food and wine with lots of choices and all very good, well plated and thought out. The FAs were responsive and worked hard, they saw issues without being told and dealt with them gracefully.

Chose two seats together, there are not a lot of these, but they were great. You expect very little in economy these days as most airlines have made economy a miserable experience for passengers. Singapore Airlines still treats economy passengers with respect and I was so impressed. We boarded in sections in Melbourne, it was monitored carefully with some held back as they tried to ""skip the queue"" as some always do. Left a little late but not by much. the hot towels before you leave and just before you arrive are a nice touch most airlines have stopped. The seat was wider than most economy. We got a refreshing drink and peanuts shortly after takeoff. Two hours in was a meal. I chose non seafood so my seat was stickered accordingly, I had a fantastic lunch. Quality tender chicken breast in a lovely light soy gravy with perfectly cooked vegetables, hot crispy bread roll, crackers, cheese, water, dessert and real cutlery, Drinks though didn't come out until everyone else got their lunch and I did sit with my tray there till everyone else was done too. No big deal. Entertainment was probably the only thing that they fall down on with not the greatest sound quality. Had a nap after lunch, then a mushroom and chicken pie before landing, All in all the Melb-Singapore flight was pretty well near perfect and we even landed half hour early. Singapore to Hanoi was on an older plane again. Seats had some marks in them, pocket torn and window very scratched. The service was good still, but not quite as good as on the ex Melb flight. The entertainment system again not the greatest but watchable. The food too, another lunch seemed to be lacking both in quality and quantity but was still pretty good.

"""place cushions for back support""",8,Bojan Tercon,25th September 2016,"✅ Verified Review |  Singapore to Dubai. On my last flight I sat bulkhead. Today I’m sitting on a regular next gen biz class seat on SQ. I’m tall and with this seat if you’re sitting straight up (or slightly angled) you cannot stretch your legs straight ahead for you hit the seat in front. So to stretch out you have to sit sideways to put your feet in the allocated space. Thus, you also need to place a lot of cushions for back support so that you don’t feel the corner of the seat into which you’re leaning. Once you get into position it’s OK. But initially it feels uncomfortable for you’re sitting sideways. It also feels more extreme/tight compared to the older version of this seat. Given how many great new business class seats there are out there where you stretch out straight ahead, I think Singapore Airlines is soon going to have to change this seat configuration to stay on top. It is fine for medium-haul flights, but I think for the super long-haul flights it would become uncomfortable. A small detail that I love on these newly refurbished planes is the toilet seat handle. Such a simple feature that I’ve seen for years on the B747-800i but not on any other planes. With this small handle it’s so easy to lift the toilet seat up and so much more hygenic than the old way.

Never had any trouble with taking my guitar on other flights but as I went to book into my flight at Brisbane I was told that it was not company policy to let people take instruments on board and that I'd have to stow it under the plane. After a long discussion with the manager about how I've never had any trouble before and that it'd easily fit in an overhead onboard the aircraft she said to come back to the desk at around 9:30 when the crew would arrive, so I could ask them if I could be made an exception. I came back at 9 to be told that the crew had already arrived and said no so I would have to stow the instrument, I was then made to sign a form to waive my right to sue if the instrument was damaged before boarding the aircraft. I was assured by the staff that the guitar would be treated with the utmost care and I tried to put it to the back of my mind and enjoy the flight. Upon arriving back home I'm sad to see the wood on the head of the guitar has split and two of the tuning pegs have been damaged meaning my guitar which has traveled the world with me is now no more than an expensive ornament. What made me really dissapointed was being told there wouldn't be enough room on the aircraft for my guitar and then seeing 3 overhead compartments directly next to me free of any carry on luggage and plenty of seats free for it to have been stored. I know it's not Singapore Airlines policy to let people take instruments as carry on but I'm less than impressed about being lied to about not having enough room onboard and the fact that every other airline I've flown has had no problems with it.

Both flights were supposed to have used Terminal 2 in Singapore making in theory the transfer straightforward. The Heathrow flight arrived at Terminal 3 however while the Bali flight left from Terminal 1 which made for a longer transfer. The inflight entertainment system is good but not quite as good as Emirates. I was really impressed with the food and drink offered. I had a curry on the flight to Singapore which was excellent as was the ice cream served as a sweet. There was also a good selection of beers, wines and spirits.

"""The service was excellent""",7,Rama Chandrin,12th August 2016,"✅ Verified Review |  New Delhi to Denpasar via Singapore on business class on Velocity Points Redemption. SQ did not offer A380 business class seats for our travel dates from Delhi. Flight timings were convenient as the flight happened throughout the day bringing passengers into Bali via Singapore by late evening. The service was excellent, barring a negative moment on the SIN-DPS sector. Ground staff in New Delhi were kind to allow me to hand in a package to my driver which I was careless about. They collected it at the gate and made proper inquiries with me before agreeing to handover the envelope to my driver who came to collect it later. SilverKris Lounge in DEL was average in terms or service or offer and reflected the usual attributes of airlines offering mediocre service at Indian airports. Due to Indian regulations no champagne is served on boarding Business Class in India. Flight attendants were friendly and the business class product had no concerns. In-flight entertainment options aren't as large as Emirates, but had an eclectic selection of movies to select from. From SIN-DPS, we encountered a scenario which left a sour taste of the experience. The offered menu had an option of beef. Living in India good beef is hard to come across, so the plan was to indulge in beef on the way to DPS, since beef options were not available on the DEL-SIN sector. On requesting for a beef dish, I was advised that they had run out of beef and was offered the option of chicken or seafood. No apologies or offers to check if an economy meal was available. My partner chose not to have a meal since he wasn't keen on the seafood or the chicken. At this point three members of the cabin crew apologised profusely to him and assured him that they would do anything possible to make things better. At this point my partner asked the crew why the same apologies or service recovery efforts were not made with me, and the crew member simply mentioned, 'I'm sorry but we weren't aware that you were travelling together!'

I had researched Premium Economy with SIA. The flight on A380 tended to be more comfortable with more room. Boarding in Sydney was chaotic and confusing. The A350 seat to Amsterdam was very uncomfortable (front row) and the foot rest was redundant - I am 188 cm tall and this seat is not designed for my build by any means. Service was generally good but not up to the marketing hype. Only offered champagne once on each leg despite the way it is marketed and if I wanted more if was begrudgingly offered. Food (Book the Cook) was okay. Considering cost and advertising this as a premium cabin, there was no sense of privacy or a little bit more exclusivity because rarely, if ever, were dividing curtains or wall dividers closed. This was more for the convenience of FA who were moving between Premium and Economy with food trolleys, etc. Many Economy pax took the opportunity to wander through cabin, especially when nursing crying babies. Also, noise, especially many screaming babies were immediately behind my rear row seat in A380 flights - very noisy (even with noise cancelling headphones). Certainly there was more room and a little more comfort but at what cost - I don't feel it was anywhere near value for money. My biggest concern and complaint, which I made to FA, and even to SIA customer service, on CDG to SIN flight (July 15), was when parents left their two boys in Premium Economy while they took themselves off to Business class. They did check a few times but basically the two boys were left to their own devices. I had to stop them from damaging the lights, the window shutters, clambering over their seats, especially the young boy of 4-5 years. The FA cannot be expected to keep an eye on two young boys and neither should passengers. In this day and age, this is a big concern. Anything could have happened to the boys. What if there was an emergency - who would look after them? They became very restless and eventually I complained to FA but nothing was done. The parents were inconsiderate, selfish and irresponsible. Singapore Airlines were disrespectful of other paying pax. As a passenger, why should anyone's flight be disrupted and stressful due to others' selfishness as in this case? This is not about whatever class your in; airlines must stop parents from abandoning their children like this for everyone's sake. Also, if anything happened to the children, who is liable - the other passengers? the airline? Would I fly SIA Premium Economy again - I seriously doubt it. It has potential but if they don't deliver on their marketing promises, I will fly other airlines who do. Also it is disappointing that they cannot even respond to a written complaint. If you over-promise and under deliver consistently, you have dissatisfied customers.

I flew with Singapore Airlines from Singapore to Melbourne (29/07/2016) in Premium Economy as part of a return trip to Colombo. This was my first time flying Premium Economy with Singapore Airlines, though I have flown it before with another large Asian carrier (which was a good experience). I usually fly economy with my partner for holidays and business class for work trips, so have some sense of the competition and product on offer. I'm also tall (194cm) and fairly broad which can make fitting into standard economy seats a squeeze. I had read a few reviews before the flight (all positive) about the new Premium Economy offering from Singapore Airlines and was interested to see for myself. The boarding at Changi was surprisingly disorganised and something of a circus. There was also some delays with take off which appeared to put the staff into such a fluster they forgot to give us menus or the standard amenity pack. The seats in Premium Economy look modern and fancy but are surprisingly uncomfortable for tall people. While they provide a bit more leg room and recline it is hard to make much use of this in a comfortable manner, and forget about getting much sleep. The foot rest offers nothing other than an annoyance and a reduction of leg room. The staff were (on the positive side) not rude but generally unhelpful, unfriendly, looked bored and appeared to go out of their way to not offer anything that might be perceived as an extra (eg. another glass of wine, a second cup of coffee, authentic hospitality etc). The main meal was very small and surprisingly un-tasty. The snack before landing was meant to be chicken fried rice but I struggled within the minuscule dish to find anything other than white rice and a couple of bits of carrot. The meals were so small and mean I was starving by the end of the 7.5 hour flight. The wine/champagne (if you're very lucky you can get one glass) they serve in a plastic tumbler (unlike the ad). The staff also have a habit of leaving you locked in with your empty meal tray for about an hour, which I can only imagine is a crowd control exercise. The entertainment system was good with a reasonable range of titles though annoying compulsory ads at the start of each viewing. It has an bad habit of switching itself on while you are trying to sleep as the controls are right where your knee pushes into the side of the seat. Overall, Singapore PE appeared to me to be a very average Economy with a slightly fancier looking seat, though not one that is well designed or practical for taller people. The service is anything but premium, in fact I've had better service in standard economy for a whole lot less dollars.

Out of MNL via a very, very old B772ER with the very, very old recliner seats with pull out screens in a 2-3-2 configuration. Singapore Airlines should retire or refit this plane soon. I don't think it's fair that they charge premium price for such an aged regional bird. Despite the trademark efficient, if not cold, SQ style service and tasty in-flight catering, very little can justify premium SQ pricing. The recliners are not a big issue on the short 3.5 hour flight and can actually be quite comfortable for a quick snooze after the meal service, but the screen is prone to glare, and my wife's screen was just malfunctioning the whole trip, making her experience not much different from a recent J class experience on a shorter MNL-HKG trip on PR with no IFE save for borrowed iPads. There wasn't the standard stowage space you'd expect from more modern J class products, but the toilets were clean and the amenities plentiful. So disappointed on this leg.

Crew on this flight of the Singapore Airlines standard. They did the usual greeting when boarding, pre-flight drink and hot towel. Hot Towel is something not many airlines offer. Bangkok is not one of the country where you can book the cook, but the foods were not too bad with a Thai dessert on the tray. The cabin is clean even though this is relatively old plane.

"""not be using them in the future""",3,Tazra Hawkins,18th July 2016,"Perth to Zurich return via Singapore. I booked my flight through a flight partner (Virgin Australia) and before this trip I didn't know how flight partners worked, all it did was give me a headache. I wanted to book in my seats, normally you can do that online, however I was unable to do so either through Virgin's website nor through Singapore Airline's. I called Virgin and they told me I need to speak with Singapore. I called Singapore and requested seats. That worked fine. However on the flight over I didn't realise that sitting right at the back was so noisy, I wore earplugs the whole flight and could still hear the noise, but that was fine, I learned my lesson, but when breakfast came, I was the very last person to be served they ran out of the edible meals and the other meal was some kind of fish (which smelled too strong for a confined space). I normally am one to enjoy all kinds of basic airplane food and am really not fussy, but this was too much. Fish for breakfast? I actually was really unhappy because I never got a choice. Knowing all of this, I decided to change my flight home seat booking, so I wasn't the last person on the plane right down the back near all the noise. I emailed Singapore airlines with the request as soon as I landed. It took a couple weeks until they responded with a stock email saying I need to contact Virgin. I emailed back saying Virgin cannot do this as they dont have access to the seating plan, it is Singapore's job and I know as I have done it before. The email response that returned was the same stock email as they had sent again. This time I was really angry and re-iterated that they should please read the content of my email. Third time and I received the same exact response again. This was now 1 month after my original request (lucky I was away for 6 weeks). I had to find a way to call them while overseas (which was a who other headache) because this was not being resolved online. So I called them and had a very long difficult conversation trying to get the guy to help me as he really wasn't actually listening to what I needed and I was getting frustrated. He finally put in the request for me to get the seats changed and when I told him about the food last time he said he could also request a no seafood meal. So I thought great, I'll do that. On my flight home, the seats were all good but this time I discovered that requesting a non seafood meal means that they dont give you any option at all whatsoever, you just get the eggs, even when the meals being served are chicken or beef with no seafood options! When I asked if I get to choose the normal menu as it already is non seafood, I got an abrupt response about taking the meal from someone else. Gosh I had no idea about all this rubbish. So I learned a lot of things this flight. That Singapore Airlines have terrible online support and rubbish food and no matter what I did it didn't get better. I hear all these great things about Singapore Airlines and its probably fine if things are going ok for you but when they go wrong, they dont help you, not without a lot of effort and frustration any way. I will not be using them if I can help it, in the future.

"""not as good as I expected""",6,Ron Cruickshank,17th July 2016,"✅ Verified Review |  London to Melbourne via Singapore. In general, the boarding process and on-board service was very good, with most flight attendants being amiable and chatty. The food was good too, apart from a very ordinary entree leaving London. However, both flights were marred by very noisy children. On the first sector (on the very quiet A380) I was in the front cabin which offers a more intimate setting. A small baby cried almost all of the trip despite attempts by his parents to pacify him. So a decent sleep was impossible. Even the supplied noise-cancelling headsets could not eliminate all of the noise, and anyway they produced a constant repetitive buzzing noise. I fully support family travel and do feel for parents who have to deal with distressed children but surely SIA could arrange for a quiet area for travellers. The sector to Melbourne was worse. I was seated in the front row of the small front cabin - with 2 rows of seats and no bassinet places. Behind me was a family of 5 with a girly toddler who screamed for most of the flight. A baby crying I can understand, but this family was generally very noisy and seemed unaware that they were sharing the cabin with other passengers. There seemed to be no attempt by cabin staff to try to improve the situation, even though their exchanged looks indicated that they were aware of the noise. Added to that, the cabins of the un-upgraded B777-300ER's are becoming quite shabby and worn, and the IFE systems are behind the times.

No turn down service (flight left Melbourne at 1835hrs) though a nice warm doona provided. The seat only has a thin foam pad as an underlay when turned down. Meals were served when they determined, not you. I say ""meals"" though for some reason there was nothing offered coming into Singapore although the menu showed a snack available. I used ""book the cook"" and the fish was sublime but the remainder of the meal was nothing too exciting. There is no toiletry bag though SQ pride themselves on having hand creams and lotions etc in the toilets. Which is fine but we all love a take away from a flight, surely we should be given a choice? Also, no pj's! These days it's just expected. The Silver Kris inflight was pretty poor, limited number of first run (decent) movies, I ended up watching some videos on my iPad.

Cabin was only half-full so some people moved to vacant rows, however due to seat design they couldn't really stretch out. Which comes to my only complaint which is the design of the seats. They would possibly rank as the most uncomfortable airline seats I have ever sat in. They are too short in the squab (where you sit) and the leg rest is almost useless. I would hazard a guess that some seats in economy are more comfortable.

"""treat passengers quite well""",8,Richard Marks,20th May 2016,"✅ Verified Review | Tokyo Narita to Los Angeles with Singapore Airlines (SQ12). A380 on the upper level Business Class section. Service on Singapore Airlines is top notch, staff are very friendly and professional and treat passengers quite well. Food and drinks selections are excellent with a wide range of choices available. Having flown on several A380's primarily those operated by Singapore Airlines, I have found that this one offers some of the older seating which I am not terribly fond of. My problem with the seats is that the foot rest shelf is offset and does not allow for one to site with their legs straight ahead, instead you have to angle your legs slightly which is uncomfortable. Also on these older planes, the electrical controls for the seats are showing their age and heavy use by being slow to respond or not respond at all. For converting your seat into a bed, there is unfortunately no information provided and either requires you to spend a great deal of time figuring it out or waiting for an attendant to help you (or watch them while they help someone else). Basically the latch to release the seat back is located on the upper outer edge towards the aisle, but is well concealed so not easy to find even by touch. You must also make sure that the seat is in the full upright position before trying to convert it to a bed. Another problem that I have encountered is that the temperature in the cabins is usually on the warm side which makes it difficult to sleep well. With regards to inflight WiFi, it would be nice if this was included for Business Class and Suites passengers considering the cost of tickets on Singapore Airlines.

There is no overhead locker space for 35A as the partition wall blocks the cabin bins, while 31A has a single storage pocket on the bulkhead, stuffed with magazines etc, rather than the double pockets on the seat backs. I utilised the Book-The-Cook service on all legs, which were nice meals but nothing to really to separate them from regular inflight meals in terms of presentation. The seats were nice and comfortable with excellent width, recline and nice leg rest. The big bonus was the generous 13.3"" screen size which was clear and wonderful for watching the IFE. However the high wall mounted screens in row 31 meant that any movie I watched or personal photographs I wanted to view, they would be on view to the whole cabin. Whilst seated in 35A, I could clearly watch what was on the screen of the person in 31K for example. The staff were super attentive as they always are on an SQ flight. The only hassle was the Auxiliary Power Unit failing on the SYD-SIN leg which meant that there was no AC boarding the flight and a prolonged wait to depart the the flight at Changi Airport.

This was partly my fault as I was over the baggage allowance, although this had never been a problem with other airlines. The explanation was that SQ is strict with their baggage allowances - fair enough. However the amount of time it took was unacceptable. This resulted in having to rush through passport control and the TRS and left me with about 15- 20 minutes to quickly eat something before having to board the 4pm flight. The business class cabin was full of children. I had booked the flight 1 week prior and opted for the afternoon flight as the reservations agent had told me it was almost empty. I understand loads can change, but if I had known I would have opted for the evening flight even though this would have allowed only about 1 hour 30 minutes in Changi before catching the connecting flight. The food was inedible - my specially selected chef inspired meal of Tasmanian salmon was dry, with rubbery beans and overcooked pasta. The breakfast served just before landing in Milan was awful - two rubbery and cold poached eggs. There is no business class amenity kit provided - how cheap can an airline get? It just smacks of miserliness. I sent a formal complaint to Singapore Airlines and their lukewarm reponse was to say sorry. It is simply not good enough. Frankly, this airline has dramatically slipped. It can no longer be considered a top tier airline. The only saving grace is the personnel, who are exceptional. The business class lounge staff and most of the flight attendants were absolutely wonderful. However, this is not enough to redeem this airline.

Plastic cups not really an issue but I prefer glass. More importantly: they still serve the cotton hot towels which is a real pleasure. Legroom was decent and the meals were delicious and nice presented. Service on the Amsterdam-Singapore leg and vice versa was of a very high level and consistent. I really appreciate the hard working cabin crew, nothing is too much trouble to ask for. When you push the service button an attendant comes to you generally within twenty seconds. What really surprises me is that they do not forget anything. When I asked for an extra bread or drink during the busy meal services they always came back to satisfy me. I have done this quite a few times and was never disappointed. Very different from my experience with other airlines. Unfortunately the cabin crew on the Singapore-Perth leg and vice versa were a little less attentive. Still good but not exceptional. Meal services took a bit longer and I think this is due to less crew than on SIA's long haul flights. I am happy with this airline and would like to fly in their new A350. Hopefully they will not decline economy services after the roll-out of premium economy.

First of all, we were very disappointed with the seat. It may well be the broadest business class seat amongst the airlines but it is very hard to sit on. I felt very uncomfortable after 5 minutes. Singapore Airlines have obviously spent a lot of money installing leather seats but they have seriously overlooked the comfort factor. If you're travelling with a loved one the new 'pods' do not permit easy communication. Secondly, you have to make the seat into a bed yourself. This approach is just not good enough. For example, on Air New Zealand the crew ask you when you'd like to lie down and make your bed up for you. The service was just average.

"""managed a comfortable rest""",10,Edwin Van Helsdingen,17th December 2015,"Flew Singapore Airlines from London to Singapore. They always provide a great service and today's flight was no different. From priority boarding as a business class traveller and getting a pre-flight drink as soon as you get seated is always a good start to your flight. The service provided during meal times was good and had no problems with not having my preferred option. Food and drink overall was great. As for the fold out bed I found it too narrow and not quite long enough. But I still managed a comfortable rest. The bathroom amenities were very good and had exactly what I needed. One thing that leaves me with a good impression is the fact the crew are very willing and clearly enjoy what they are doing. I would recommend.

"""disappointing set of experiences""",5,C Gibson,8th December 2015,"Perth to Tokyo Narita via Singapore. Having flown SQ fairly regularly over the past 20 years it is interesting to see a decline in economy class, most particularly its lack of crew consistency. SQ used to be my favourite for its crew consistency in service and courtesy. Sadly, I notice it declining every year the past five or so. Check-in at Perth by snobbish and cold DNata staff quite a difference from past experiences. Perth to SIN was not bad on the older 777-200, not completely full so had a spare seat between myself and the window passenger. Legroom was good on these older jets, with an older entertainment system, which I tend not to use that much. The food was fairly dire for economy and portion sizes terribly small compared to the past. Why is the choice always a bland beef or fish (even when labelled the 'Asian' dish)? Singapore is a nation with a rich culinary tradition, but the meals were invariably bland and uninteresting on all four flights. Choosing the Hindu non-veg meals on the return journey to was more a fraction more spice, but again miniscule portions. But worse was the robotic and occasionally sullen crew. Not once on the PER-SIN did I see the inflight supervisor smile the many times he was in economy class. Just haughty and stiff. Upon disembarking, he couldn't even raise a smile for the economy class passengers. Apart from two very junior staff (about 1-2 months on the job, I asked them), who were pleasant and helpful and actually bothered to make eye contact, the rest of the crew I saw in economy were none of that. Mainly robotic, courteous but practically no eye contact and a cold efficiency. TYO-SIN was a dreadful red-eye special at the rear of a packed Boeing 777-300ER. A noisier plane more claustrophobic feeling large jet I have not encountered down the back. It was unpleasant for a nearly 7 hours in darkness. The leg room is just passable. The entertainment system was the only saving grace for those who enjoy it late at night. Food again was ordinary and bland and small portions. Drink service was stingy. I became visibly ill during the flight and whilst crew members saw me using a sick back and using the toilets repeatedly, did not once ask if I needed anything. Mostly the crew sat down at the back around the galleys gossiping in the interval between meal services. They worked fairly hard during service, but there was no warmth for passengers. On both flights, the time taken to clear the meal trays is now long, nearly one and a half hours on both flights. Unconscionable on a past-midnight flight when the majority of passengers generally wish to sleep.  For the passenger who remembers their finer years, I will no longer give them preference when considering my options from PER to TYO.

By the time I received my meal, it was cold - they never came and offered extra drinks, tea/coffee. Took ages to clear trays - in fact passengers were returning trays to meal area. When kids cried, there were no crew trying to help in any way - they were hidden most of the time. They found it very hard to smile! Their training seems to have declined - it's not just important enough to look after the business section, people in economy used to be treated well too. The food is as bad as the US airlines and now the crew is behaving like the crew on US airlines. I find it sad that I will have to try and find another airline. My daughter in law flew from Singapore to Geneva and Zurich to Singapore and she struggled with her 11 month old till she complained to the supervisor and then they changed the attitude!

Given the segment was from Singapore to London - it was coming from their hub. I find it hard to imagine that they didn't know in advance they were doing this and at the very least to offer a refund. Instead we were pulled aside as we were getting on the plane (despite having boarding passes with Premium Economy allocated seats) and offered an upgrade voucher for another flight (from Economy to Premium Economy). We could not use the upgrade voucher as we are not in a position to travel long distance in the next year before it would expire. It would also have meant we would have had to fly from Melbourne to Singapore to use this voucher - and then pay to fly all the way back too! I emailed Singapore Airlines 3 times and did not have a satisfactory response - the offer was that we could use the voucher on any segment (I don't think there are many segments longer than Singapore-London, so that would be a win for them) and $500 in travel vouchers for use in the next year with Singapore Airlines - again not practical for us.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to London,September 2015,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,no

Arrival in Zurich was on time at just before 0800.

The meal was just sandwiches and drinks, so disappointing for a business class offering. Also, no-one had thought to let us know which terminal we would disembark at.

"""TV is so near to the seat""",6,Azri Azmi,6th October 2015,I flew Singapore Airlines Boeing 777 from Singapore to London. The new seat for business class on this Boeing 777 is quite uncomfortable in that the TV is so near to the seat and my head. I got headache watching it for too long. The TV position at the side of my face makes its quite hard for me to look at the TV.  Malaysia Airlines business class seat seat is 2x2x2 layout but it is easier to view the TV. Qatar Airways seat arrangement is similar to Singapore Airlines layout of 1-2-1 but but it is more comfortable to watch the TV as it well positioned in front of your leg and equip with advance IFE systems. There is no business class travel kit provided by Singapore Airlines and it is a 5 Star airline. There is no such problem on Singapore Airlines A380 but the TV screen is 2 inches smaller.,Boeing 777-300,Solo Leisure,Business Class,KUL to LHR via SIN,September 2015,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,2,no

Plus at breakfast they left me alone for ages, because they forgot my meusli. They were nice, but their service rhythm was way off. Worst of all was that seat. I was in 11K, which meant I was bulkhead, with a seat behind me. The guy in it kept moving about kicking his legs out all the time. Because of the seat design, his legs were right by my head, so  I had this thump of his twitching legs and feet, which made sleep impossible.",Boeing 777-300,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Singapore to Auckland,October 2015,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,4,yes

The cabin was in very good condition and I like these seats - they are actually soft and comfortable. Service was efficient, maybe not overly friendly but still pleasant. I like the leather covering around most of these seats which adds a touch of class. Very good lunch service and a decent refreshment on the way into Singapore. This is the first time I have seen the flip down flatbed and I prefer this configuration because at least the seat has a comforter and is reasonably soft - flew Cathay recently and found the seat too hard to sleep. The angled sleeping is really a non-issue for me. Singapore to London Heathrow on the new business class. This is slightly better but I did not see a major upgrade - looks a bit more modern with a bigger screen. Same flip down configuration that worked about the same. Two decent meals plus snacks on demand meant that I arrived well fed and refreshed. Slight glitch on Krisworld was the only issue.

"""worst customer service experience""",1,L Powell,25th September 2015,"My husband and I flew with Singapore Airlines from Sydney to London via Singapore, with our 9 month old twins and our older son. We purchased an extra ticket for one of our twins to give us extra space. They initially had us all over the flight. Eventually just before boarding they allowed my husband and I to sit together but we lost the extra seat we purchased and they had three babies in a row! This meant it was so cramped none of the babies could sleep and they all ended up screaming for the entire flight (setting each other off), we bought the extra ticket to avoid this scenario. I noted that there were spare bassinets and empty rows elsewhere on the plane so that wasn't the issue. Neither we nor the other parents or surrounding passengers were pleased. Singapore Airlines are trying to do the same thing to us on our upcoming trip on the way home. They are arguing that since one of our infants has a child seat the baby isn't an infant, and can't have a bassinet, therefore since the other twin has a bassinet we can't be seated together. They won't budge, so one parent with have to juggle one baby on their lap somewhere else on the plane, whilst the other parent has the other baby in front of a bassinet. That's apparently more logical to them then just seating us together. So it becomes impossible to sleep, eat or go to the bathroom. We will never fly with Singapore Airlines again.

However, I must admit the cost cutting is very evident, for the quality and quantity of food and beverages.  While food quantity is not too bad, it is way less than what it was in the past. In the amenity kit offered in economy, the least they can do is offer a good toothpaste. Lastly, the staff should offer drinks either before the meals or with meals. If one has ordered a special meal, it is served before everyone else. However the drinks are only served when they come with the trolley to serve the general meals, which can be upto 30 minutes later - by which time the meal is either cold or finished.

Singapore Airlines customer review,9,John Bobby,25th August 2015,Have flown Singapore Airlines multiple times and is probably one of the best airlines I have flown so far in terms of quality and service. I decided to travel on their new premium economy flight. The first leg Sydney to Singapore a A380 premium economy and the next leg on a Silk Air Boeing 737-800 which I won't be reviewing here. There is a separate line for boarding premium economy which is good. The seats were 2-4-2 vs 3-4-3 on economy. There are altogether around 6 or 7 rows with a maximum of 48 or 56 in the section. The seats are wider with more leg room and a retractable thigh rest. I did not use this feature much. It has got a bigger seat which is more comfortable. It is not a flat bed similar to business class. The food was good and I know you can order certain special chef prepared meals before boarding on the website. Champagne is available along with wine etc. The entertainment system is a larger screen which I think is either 11 or 13 inch and there are noise cancelling larger headphones available as standard.

Singapore Airlines customer review,5,R Young,23rd August 2015,"Lounge in Brisbane had been ""refreshed"" since my last visit and looked more pleasant. Had booked a centre seat on 777 as travelling alone and had checked in on line but reallocated to an aisle next to another passenger at the window. It is difficult for a fellow passenger to get to the aisle without disturbing you if you are asleep. Cabin was full so could not move. My personal preference if for a herringbone layout when traveling alone. Crew on the leg Brisbane to Singapore were somewhat helpful and friendly, less so on the leg to Delhi but both were OK. I asked for a water on board when in the air after having left Brisbane but was told by the crew member that they were going to a ""briefing"" and I would need to wait. It arrived 20 minutes later. Sleeping on both legs was a bit challenging given that the beds are not flat and you do get used to them being so on other carriers. On the 777 the passenger beside me woke me twice trying to get to the bathroom. Asking for help with the A380 bed was met an explanation of how to do and that it was easy rather that actual help and I had to go back to ask again. Entertainment OK but had to rewind to get to the start of the movie and it ""dropped out"" twice on the 777. Sadly, food was not great, my special meal is almost always the same on SG and was overcooked this time. Coffee was good. Wine selection looked good and had a Tattinger and a Chablis with both being very enjoyable. No bubbly offered pre take off on either flight. A380 cabin a bit scuffed around my seat but otherwise interiors were fine. On time arrival and departures. On balance this was my choice to India as Qantas/ Emirates were via Dubai or on a 737 on Jet Airways via Singapore or Air India via Sydney.

Furniture was in disrepair, there was a bar that didn't appear to have been used for some time, sitting next to a disconnected fridge, no alcohol, food that looked inedible and was hardly warm and stained bulky furniture in the main room (this was full). Boarding was fast and efficient, the first leg meal was a salad of tomato, lettuce, cucumber and carrot with no dressing, butter but no bread and chopped chicken in tomato sauce that was dry and uninspiring.

Singapore Airlines customer review,10,Ian Chow,13th July 2015,"Once again, SQ went above and beyond in delivering the highest standard of service a customer can expect. Upon boarding and realising the aircraft is only half-filled, the crew offered my family and I each a row so that we would have a more comfortable flight. Before take off, the crew even engaged in small talk with the passengers, informing us of what we can expect upon arriving in Maldives and some of the activities we could join. During the flight, the crew walks frequently to check on passengers but are never intrusive. Drinks were served throughout the flight (without passengers asking for them).

An incredible range of inflight movies including Asian and international films, with fairly large screens. Inflight meal was above average, though not impressive.

Singapore Airlines customer review,1,Michael Wake,27th June 2015,"The experience today at Shanghai Airport was a debacle. The flight was delayed 2hrs and 20 mins. This meant our connecting flight would be missed. What started out as a long 2 leg trip, slowly got longer. I then discovered that the boarding had moved gates. No announcement. I discovered it by chance walking past the departure board. Boarding was a joke. People were pushing in, the staff had no control or idea. The new gate was a transfer by bus. Followed by a 50m walk in the rain and up the stairs. The airconditioner on the plane did not work on boarding, we sat for over 30 mins sweating. When it finally took off, it was 4 hrs 20 mins late. This put us in Singapore at 1.45am with a 6 hours wait for the next flight. When we landed, they offered a hotel, 30 mins taxi ride there and 30 mins back.

Singapore Airlines customer review,5,R Navarrete,22nd June 2015,"Manila to Paris via Singapore return. The A330s on MNL-SIN-MNL are new, with comfortable seats and a little more legroom, compared to A380s on SIN-CDG-SIN. In the A380s, seats are cramped. Except for the idea of flying in an unusually large aircraft, I did not feel anything special during the trip. In the economy section of the A380 there are only 2 toilets given the number of passengers in each section of the aircraft. The toilet I used for the flight CDG-SIN had a clogged wash basin! Food service nothing remarkable, rolls  are very ordinary. The only thing that perked up these meals were the ice cream bars served as dessert. Check in service in Manila for the outbound flights to Paris was good - efficient and courteous. It was the opposite in Paris for the return. The check in staff was rude. The same thing with the security staff who man the line of passengers reporting for check in. They ""manage"" this long line by cutting it up into two and bringing later-arriving passengers to a separate line that, in effect, let's them jump unjustly over passengers who came earlier. This is an irksome experience from an airline that prides itself in being the best. A strong point though on my flights was the inflight entertainment, Krisworld, which offers countless choices.

Food out of SIN was very nice, food out of JNB was very average, but I assume that is dependant on what the local ground handlers can provide. Cabin clean enough and well maintained. SQ's lie flat seats - you either like them or you don't. I am in the latter category. Not supportive enough when seated, and too hard and with an odd angled lying position when flat. But this is old news and newer cabins are on their way. Main complaint was that this B777-200ER was a bit tired in terms of ICE (smallish screens with limited movie collection) and WIFI (there wasn't any!). The latter was a particular bugbear for me as the return flight was daytime, I planned to get some work done, but couldn't due to no WIFI connection.

Singapore Airlines customer review,8,Brian O'Connell,4th June 2015,SQ11 LAX-NRT-SIN 12 May and return on SQ12 19 May. Was my first time flying the A380 despite a few bumps of turbulence near NRT I found it to be an amazingly quiet aircraft. Flight attendants were courteous efficient and professional coming through the cabin frequently with hot towels as well as water/juices to keep passengers hydrated during the 10+ hour flights. They also knew when to leave passengers undisturbed something you don't really see with many carriers. The seating despite being economy class was pretty roomy both flights weren't entirely full so I got some room to stretch out and sleep for a few hours. The only real fly in the ointment was on SQ12 where the aft toilets weren't working. That wasn't too big an issue as the flight wasn't full but I can definitely see where it would be if the plane was chock-a-block packed. All things considered though I really enjoyed the experience on SQ which proves why international carriers especially Asian ones are miles ahead of any U.S. carriers (with the exception of VX and B6). I would definitely recommend SQ to friends and family; I'm really looking forward to trying out their premium economy service when it rolls out maybe one day the suites!,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes

Singapore Airlines customer review,6,David Killick,31st May 2015,SIN-CHC overnight flight in economy. Singapore Airlines has been my favorite airline for over 30 years so I am disappointed to write a less than stellar review on this occasion. Flight attendants remain as helpful charming and efficient as ever. Food and wine are excellent down to the after-dinner ice cream. But this old B777 was tired. So much noisier than the A380 we had just been on. After being in premium economy standard economy seats were so tight. Poor tall guy in the seat in front must have found it tough. Even with a free seat in between myself and my wife it was hard getting in and out and a bum in the face is just not a civilised way to travel in my opinion. We really hope Singapore Airlines introduces premium economy and newer aircraft join this route soon! (The airline is scheduled to launch P/E in September). Another letdown was the IFE. Poor choice especially audio. I like to settle down and doze while listening to some relaxing guys. I gave up on both audio and video as the headphones were useless and the white noise too much to hear anything. Improvement required!,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,,3,yes

First class crew addressed by name throughout and constant top ups of drinks. Book the cook option of monkfish as very nice! SIN-SYD was an a380 same excellent service as the first leg although the veal option was a little disappointing. Return SYD-SIN was on an ancient 777-200ER seat really showing it's age and an antiquated IFE. However the crew made up for this with their usual excellent service and the food was excellent. SIN-LHR on an a380 with all business class top deck. slightly indifferent service on this leg but still pretty good in terms of industry overall. Would definitely recommend although watch out for the old equipment used on some journeys.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5,yes

Singapore Airlines customer review,6,R Cheung,28th May 2015,Traveled 4 segments. HKG-SIN-SYD and return on a 772ER 773ER A388 and A333. Haven't flown long haul with them for quite a few years but I think it has deteriorated. Seat pitch is too tight for an airline like SQ and the cost cutting in services is apparent with the bottle of water provided gone and wine glasses replaced by plastic and red and white wines now poured from a large bottle instead of the airline sizes they used to provide. I also remembered when flying long haul some years back they actually provided hot chocolate drinks throughout the night which doesn't exist anymore. It just feels a lot more budget than it used to be. In terms of the cabin and plane 773ER had the best IFE and new seats which i think is slightly more comfortable than the ones on the A388 and A333 which had identical seats and IFE but still I regard those seats as being too hard. While the A333 is supposed to be the newest plane at just 2 years old the fact that it's leased and a bridging plane meant that it was fitted with old seats and IFE the same as the A388 which SIA has flown as much as a decade. Service is OK overall but the SYD-SIN leg had a rather less enthusiastic air steward serving my section but I do accept that there are the occasional bad days. Sharp contrast to EK which I have also used during this trip. Seats better legroom better IFE better food better beverages better.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,,3,yes

Singapore Airlines customer review,3,M Berkani,22nd May 2015,CPH-SIN-DPS-SIN-CPH outbound on 15th of May and return May 21 (four segments). Must say that I am very disappointed at their service performance. Having flown many times on SQ I did not expect almost rude service from some of the cabin crew attendants. This is not the 5 star SQ that I am use to. CPH-SIN was an old refitted 777-200ER with an entertainment system from stone age. The food was quite tasty tough. Next time I fly to South East Asia I will definitely choose other options like Qatar Airways or Thai. Much better value for money.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,,2,no
Singapore Airlines customer review,5,L Lee,20th May 2015,Travelled on SQ211 on 16 May 2015 Singapore to Sydney in Economy seat 32G. Flight was full mainly connecting passengers coming in from India. Our second (light) meal was served very late almost at the time when the pilot made the announcement for cabin crew to prepare flight for arrival and some passengers including myself were still waiting to be served! It was rather stressful to rush through my meal knowing the plane was arriving soon. Apparently the reason why the second meal was served so late was due to the high volume of special meal requests from the Indian passengers. I am a Kris Flyer Frequent traveller and travel often on the Singapore to Sydney leg and have experienced/observed this problem before where the meals are served later than usual because cabin crew are serving a high volume of special meal requests. Perhaps SIA need to review the management of special meals on future flights where there are many passengers travelling from India to Sydney via Singapore. It will be interesting to ask SIA how they will manage if 90% of the passengers have special meal requests on one flight! So this was quite a let down in service for me. I also have a suspicion that the in flight meals served have become smaller and lighter in portions. Another problem was my seat TV did not have Entertainment on demand! It was most disappointing especially when I was informed while most of the other passengers had Entertainment on demand programs mine was one of the few that did not have it! Surely this type of problem should be noted by cabin crew at the end of its last flight for service maintenance. I think SIA needs to pull up its socks to maintain its renowned high standards!,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,3,yes

Airplane was very comfortable with flat seats extremely comfortable to lay down (as it was half empty most of people had a row of seats for himself). Inflight entertainment had a large variety of movies of any genre. Food was good and generally abundant. The only two drawbacks were the delay it had departing from Heathrow (more than 1 hour) and the possibility to have dinner with reclined seats meaning that I had little space for my dinner as the child in front of me decided to do so. I would still classify a 5 star experience.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,3,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,10,Tercon Bojan,20th May 2015,It's decadent luxury to fly the SQ A380 Suites from Singapore to New York. Of course I'm tempted to compare them to the Emirates suites and I have to say that overall this is a much more luxurious spacious and comfortable product than Emirates. Minus the shower which I do miss on such a long journey. The suite is on the lower deck which is wider and the sides don't curve in as they do on the upper deck so the suite is very spacious. The leather seat is extremely comfortable and plush and when they convert the suite into a bed which is separate from the seat it's the best bed in the air that I've slept in. All this can be done because the SQ suite is modular where parts move up and down as they convert it from sitting room to bed room. The food and service was excellent as is customary on SQ. I sat in row 3 which is the only row with 3 windows. I like to look out and have as much light as I can so this is important to me. Although I still don't like the A380 windows for they are recessed and make you feel like you're in a submarine!,,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,9,C Hoffmann,18th May 2015,MUC-SIN 777-300ER 5/5/15. Older plane was a bit rough around the edges but it might be one of the ones due for a refit. Flight left on time and arrived on time. Flew economy and had a whole row to myself that said there was still more than enough space if the row was full. Service was attentive with staff coming through often with drinks.

I haven't flown SA for 12 months now and I feel the service on board is slipping. Only three flight attendants to serve a full flight in the back section. No drinks except tea or coffee offered at meal times. I asked for a soft drink and got given a half a plastic cup. Serving a big chunk of chicken on a plane when crowded is virtually impossible to cut. I had to leave it. Breakfast hasn't changed in 10 years. Still the same old cold bread roll and cake. Planes seem old and dirty. My bag didn't make my Bangkok flight and was sent on the next one. Why this happened I do not know.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,,2,yes

Singapore Airlines customer review,8,C Curran,10th May 2015,"Travelled LHR-PER via SIN January 2015. Flight from London was on a brand new A380 really comfortable great IFE good food good food friendly and attentive crew. Couldn't fault anything. Flight from Singapore was delayed due to late arrival of the incoming aircraft then they were cleaning and then it was announced there was a problem with the aircraft and they had to get a replacement. After a 2 hour delay we finally get to the gate my partner who is 6' 7"" and has had DVT asked about extra legroom seats (of which none had been available at the time of booking). After checking the system they said they had no leg room seats left and he should have purchased at the time of booking but as I said this wasn't available. After boarding the flight and finding our seats we see that 4 of the extra legroom seats have children in them with feet that don't even touch the floor. Safe to say my partner was fuming as he wedged himself into his seat. The flight from SIN-PER was on an old plane and the IFE wasn't great. The screens were bad quality but that was probably due to age of the plane. The crew were really attentive and brought hot towels and drinks throughout the flight. Overall Singapore are great with friendly and attentive staff. However they shouldn't sell extra legroom seats to children.",,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,4,yes

Upon my return travelling home to Melbourne SQ237 was disappointing. The Business seats were tiny old and seat was at a very uncomfortable angle. A couple of hours into the flight my back was aching. I've flown a few times business class with this airline but this would have been the worst I have experienced. I think it's time the old planes are upgraded and the seats are refurbished.

Singapore Airlines customer review,8,Ray Edmondson,2nd May 2015,SQ 231 Singapore to Sydney 28 April 2015. The latest iteration of this airline's in-flight entertainment system features a new touch screen and other refinements but appears to have dropped an important feature of its predecessor. Everything is now shown in wide screen ratio (16:9) and there is no adjustment - at least none that I could find - for standard screen ratio (4:3) so that older movies and TV shows are horizontally distorted and unwatchable. This was easily available on the previous system. As a frequent flyer on this airline this limits my options.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,9,A Barnes,1st May 2015,LHR-SIN-PEN return. Flight from Heathrow to Singapore was the usual experience. Staff very helpful and friendly food good for airline food. Inflight entertainment is very good lots of choice. Good snacks available between meals. The A380 we flew on was looking a little tired a few marks and scratches on the seats. Flight from Singapore to Penang was with silk air. First time with them and very happy with the service.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,5,yes

Ground service was inflexible and unable to organise a meaningful seat plan for a group of ten. Aircrafts are pretty old and catering is ordinary. Space between some seats were very unacceptably narrow for an 8 hour flight. Timing and flight experience are good though.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,,3,no
Singapore Airlines customer review,8,Siauw Steve,30th April 2015,SQ11 NRT to SIN. Airbus A380-800. Although it's getting older and older (PTV not touch screen while some other airlines already have one) service is great as usual. Attentive cabin attendants. They even know how to deal with small kids so they don't meddle with other passengers. Food was great except dessert. They used to give out H-Dazs Ice creams for this route but not lately maybe cost cut measure I suspect. All in all a pleasant flight.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,8,Siauw Steve,30th April 2015,SQ-318 SIN-LHR. Brand new B777-300ER new cabin in all classes including economy. Touch screen IFE Krisworld was amazing. Due dietary reasons I opted for fruit platters for both meals and they were great. Nice snacks between meals. Friendly cabin crew clean cabin.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,8,M Bakermans,28th April 2015,"FCO-SIN-CHC on March 29 and CHC-SIN-FCO on April 13. It's a long trip from FCO to CHC but flying SQ makes it more bearable. I used to fly Emirates but the service is terrible compared to SQ and EK use the 3-4-3 configuration on the 777 while SQ still uses 3-3-3. It makes a lot of difference. I am 1.83m tall and there is plenty of legroom on SQ flights. Service and meals were good on all my sectors. Cabin crew were uniformly pleasant and welcoming. Drinks and snacks in between meals were served frequently even during the so-called ""middle of the night flights."" I fly Economy class so I don't expect too much - with SQ however I get a good experience and excellent value for my money.",,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,8,S Alpern,27th April 2015,LAX-NRT on 4/4/15 and NRT-LAX on 4/22/15 A380. Based on a limited sample of two flights we can say the hard product is outstanding the service is good to excellent depending on the crew and the food is nowhere near the best of international first class. The seats are very comfortable and the beds are terrific. Both my wife and I had a very good nights sleep. The suite is quiet with only the gentle hum of the 380's engines. The outbound cabin crew were efficient warm and eager to be helpful. The inbound cabin crew was good but certainly not exceptional. They did their job well but that was it. Food was the big disappointment. Limited selections (unless pre-ordered) and ranged from ok (lobster thermidore and beef short ribs to poor (vastly overcooked steak). Caviar service good but not the best in the air. Wines were excellent. All in all very good but still disappointing.,,,First Class,,,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,,3,yes

Singapore Airlines customer review,6,Alan Petten,27th April 2015,DEN-SIN April 2014. A330 was nice and clean. Comfortable seat and good food. Only complaint is staff tossed out the meals as soon as the plane had levelled off and seemed in a rush but didn't follow it up with much service. I expected at least a drink service (business class after all) and there was nothing you would have had to hit the call button to get service. Will know next time to request items from Singapore staff and not wait for service.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,,3,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,10,Emily Allan,22nd April 2015,I flew from Manchester England to Sydney Australia via Singapore. And having flown from Sydney to Manchester and Manchester to Sydney many times only ever using Emirates and Qantas I found a cheap deal with Singapore airlines and thought I'd give them ago. Now being from England Emirates are one of the most advertised and so I thought was the best airline. How I have been very wrong. In economy the seat sizes seem pretty much the same but with Singapore I found the seat cushions were a lot softer. The major difference I found with Singapore was the service. They were always smiling and welcoming. And this being a night flight they didn't sit down for four hours for next meal time they circled with drinks and snacks in between more than once!,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,7,Louis Nguyen Ho,19th April 2015,SIN-SGN-SIN on B777-200 and A330-300 with vastly different experience. I have been a very loyal customer to Singapore Airlines but I have to say that please phase out the B777-200 series. The aircraft is obviously old and weary as compared to A330-300 series which is very new and more comfortable. The rest is just average but understandable given it is a short haul flight and I am not very particular about food and cabin crew help. Singapore Airlines still wins me whenever I want to book an air ticket.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,,3,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,10,J Cook,19th April 2015,I flew Singapore Airlines for the first time ever last August. Since then I have flown another 2 times to Shanghai return from Brisbane. I can not fault them. The food service and seats are great. The planes between Brisbane and Shanghai are always full but the service is never lacking. The A380 between Shanghai and Singapore is great as well when I select the exit row upstairs. I will never fly another airline to China again.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,3,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,1,Deepa Chaudhury,12th April 2015,I flew business class from Singapore to Delhi two days ago and the service was extremely poor and shoddy. We were flying in from Brisbane by Singapore Airlines and took the flight to Delhi after a stop over at Changi airport. So I was in a position to compare the service on two flights of the same airlines. While on the flight from Brisbane the service was good on the flight to Delhi the hostess was pretty bad in her interpersonal conduct  very poor communication skills overbearing almost irritating. On a late night flight a little courtesy helps a traveller relax but it was surely lacking. Pretty disappointed after all the slick advertising the real experience was shockingly bad. Money badly spent.,,,Business Class,,,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,,1,no
Singapore Airlines customer review,5,D Cole,10th April 2015,I have flown SIA for years in and out of Asia. Usually good service but I have found it difficult to understand why they still have some old aircraft's flying routes - it does not represent Singapore well when it has one of the best economies in the world. The frequent flyer programme seems to have been altered also over recent years to make it so much harder to get gold status unless you pay lots more for tickets on economy. Recently I have noticed that they are handing out in-flight earpieces that I have had a bad experience with and dislike. Two flights recently when I used these I could not hear the movie clearly at all despite trying a new set. From then on I ask for the old headpiece sound sets which work well. Surely SIA can provide the best headpieces to go with its 'image'.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,,3,no
Singapore Airlines customer review,9,Smith Barrie,4th April 2015,We flew From London to Auckland via Singapore. on an Airbus 380. The review is based on all 4 flights as there was little to choose between them. The service was consistency high; attentive friendly and helpful The best I have flown and I am a regular traveller. The only disappointment for me was that the Book the cook meals were somewhat disappointing. I would have been better off with the standard meals. My wife found the beds hard and difficult to lie diagonally but they were fine for me. I would choose Singapore every time if I could.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,10,Colin Pay,1st April 2015,LHR-SIN-AKL on A380. We paid extra for exit row seats on upper deck money well spent. They are doubles with massive space in front.

Singapore Airlines customer review,1,P Thomas,1st April 2015,Less than impressed. Rather tired looking 777 to Singapore. TV kept changing between colour and black and white. Seemed understaffed for the number of passengers on board. Return flight on an A380 - no sound at my seat. Again seemed understaffed for a full plane. Trying to change flight date even with changeable ticket was painful.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,,1,no
Singapore Airlines customer review,2,P Samarasekara,28th March 2015,"We recently flew from Singapore to Christchurch New Zealand. We are frequent Business Class travellers and were extremely disappointed with the service on this airline. The cabin crew were very disorganized although obviously not short of staff. Dinner took a long time to be served. We were not given a sample to taste of the wine we ordered and the wine was poured into a glass in the galley and then brought to our seats without even being put on a tray as were all the drinks such as water tea coffee etc. I woke up early while most passengers were sleeping and the hostess asked me whether I would like breakfast even though we were about 4 hours away from our destination. I agreed but then waited two hours for it to be served. The French toast I ordered was inedible the bread rolls and croissant were cold and hard and the coffee was extremely bitter. The flat beds are uncomfortable and you need the help of the cabin staff to put them up or down. The most disappointing thing was when I reported this to the airline they simply sent back an email saying that ""meals are served two and a half hours before landing"". I'm not sure what the problem was on this particular flight as our other flights on Singapore Airlines were good. The flight was on 7th February from Singapore.",,,Business Class,,,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,,3,no
Singapore Airlines customer review,5,Kenny Ho,25th March 2015,Flew MEL to SIN using a 777-200. Ever since SQ removed the A380 from Australian flights their value for money is no longer there. The biggest problem is the IFE. During my flight the IFE was not working the movie would break in the middle of the show and during some of the time the voice would disappear. Even with twice re-booting the IFE was not working. During the time that the IFE was working the screen is so small and the picture so blurred that it became impossible to see the picture. The adjustment of the brightness was also futile. Hello SQ these aircraft's should be retired as they are degrading your brand name and definitely not worth the money we are paying for. Even Vietnam Airlines now will be flying the A350 and the B787-900 to Melbourne soon. I'm really disappointed.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,,3,no
Singapore Airlines customer review,10,William Lay,20th March 2015,SIN-SUB and SUB-SIN SQ930/931. A330-300 on both legs. Impeccable service from the minute you board to the minute you get off the plane. Hot towels were served shortly after boarding followed by food. Very courteous and pleasant crew members and at all times kept toilets clean. The aircraft's PTV was good. The seat on A330 was nice can stretch longer than some full services airline in Asia and it's comfortable. Overall a very pleasant experience and it's always a pleasure to fly Singapore Airlines.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,8,Ravindra Nabiel,20th March 2015,I flew from AKL to SIN on January 13. The plane was an Airbus A380. The service was nice and the food delicious. The only problem was the inflight entertainment system the music and the movies would stop now and then for the entire flight even though there was no announcements. Despite that this is a very pleasant flight and I would definitely fly using this airline again.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,3,Coates Sarah,20th March 2015,We were making a return trip from Kota Kinabalu through to London Heathrow via Singapore on 28th February 2015. We checked in at KK in plenty of time we were the first people to check-in! We were issued with our tickets but not told that we would not be able to sit together on the 13 hour flight from Singapore to London we discovered that by checking our tickets before entering departure. We returned to the check in desk and were told that they were unable to change this as it had been 'blocked' (We feel that we should have been told this when we checked in). We were advised to talk to the transit desk when we arrived in Singapore. On arrival we went to the transit desk the staff were very helpful but we were told that we were still unable to sit together. We had explained that my husband was a very nervous flier. When we got to the departure gate they were able to change our seats. Why could this not have been done earlier and alleviated a lot of stress for us. The breakfast meal was not very nice. Initially we were told there was only one choice which was Singapore carrot cake which we didn't want as did most people sitting near us. We were found an alternative meal which was cold! We are regular fliers to Asia and have flown with Singapore airlines many times but we feel that on this occasion the standard of service was not to the standard that we would expect from a premier airline.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,,4,no

Singapore Airlines customer review,7,T L Yang,17th March 2015,Flew on redemption tickets SQ First Singapore to Seoul and Business back from Seoul. I was very disappointed with the first class. The last time I did First was to New York about 4+ years ago on the ageing 747 that was far better an experience. Pre-flight details were excellent using the Private Dining in T3 Changi. However the food on board was terrible. My wife ordered the Japanese Kaiseki and it was not good. My Wagyu Sirloin was leather tough.However Dom Perignon 2004 did help to wash it down. Fortunately the flight back form Seoul on Business was excellent with good food. I think SQ need to re-look at their inflight food standard outbound from SIN.,,,First Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,,3,yes

Singapore Airlines customer review,8,Devottam Sengupta,4th March 2015,Travelled on DEL-SIN-DEL route a couple of times in the last month and though largely satisfied did think SQ standards are slipping a little. Given its always significantly higher priced compared to competitors I found it a little disappointing. As always no complaint on the service or IFE (except once as below) but was very disappointed with the food served on SIN-DEL leg both times (bland and just not tasty). One of the DEL-SIN flights on an A380 was a little worse than others with the IFE system not functioning properly for a large part of the flight. It had to be reset several times before it worked. Moreover the aircraft seemed a little worse for wear compared to the usual SQ equipment with some seat covers coming off and the toilet barely clean. All in all the problems were not significant but could be a sign of SQ becoming complacent on a route on which it has little to no competition.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,,3,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,9,J Kethees,24th February 2015,BNE-SIN-CMB-SIN-BNE in Economy Class. Flew A330 on all legs. Seats were comfortable cabin crew were polite and friendly and entertainment was great. If there was any complaints it would be the lack of leg-room (I am 6ft 2') although it may be more than enough for a shorter person. Would definitely fly with again.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,9,M Davies,24th February 2015,MEL-SIN-KIX return. Outward flights around 30-40% full and close to 100% on the return. Food poor on the MEL-SIN leg but enjoyable on the remainder. Excellent cabin service by friendly proactive staff including numerous water & juice runs on all legs. Return flights both delayed by around 15 minutes due to luggage having to be removed after 'no-shows'. A good selection on the entertainment system although there were some lags and occasional freezing on the flights to and from KIX. The aircraft interiors all seemed to be in good condition and the seating comfortable despite the seat pitch being a bit tighter than I remember experiencing the last time we flew with the Airline.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,9,G Parkhi,18th February 2015,PER-SIN-BOM. B777-200 on both legs. What can I say about Singapore Airlines? Impeccable service from the minute you board to the minute you get off the plane. Hot towels were served shortly after boarding followed by drinks and dinner. Very courteous and pleasant crew members. Dinner choices on the PER-SIN leg were limited to Pork Stew and Stir fried beef but they were not too bad. Breakfast was served on the SIN-BOM leg with a choice of Indian crepes or baked eggs with chicken sausage and baked beans. The aircraft's are showing signs of ageing though as some PTVs were not working and a couple of seats in the middle row seem to have had reclining problems. Overall a very pleasant experience and it's always a pleasure to fly Singapore Airlines.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,6,J Harris,18th February 2015,SYD-SIN then SIN-ZRH and return. The flights over were at Christmas so the leg to SIN was packed. Late departure made for a very tight connection at SIN. Attentive service comfortable seat for a day flight and book the cook worked but the food was ok not outstanding. SIN-ZRH on A380 was quite empty upstairs so very attentive service with the whole back part of the cabin to myself. Toilets seemed to be cleaned after every use although they're the smallest I've encountered in a business cabin. The seat was good but the mattress a bit thin and the weird need to put feet in a small box on one side isn't entirely comfortable. Honestly there are much more comfortable options. IFE wasn't as good as others but a decent selection of movies and TV shows available. I can't say I liked all the advertising on it though. Friendly attentive staff clean aircraft and ok food and entertainment but in my opinion there are better options for far less money.,,,Business Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,1,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,10,M Sommerville,6th February 2015,CPH/SIN - SIN/CPH economy. Two excellent 12 hours flights good seat comfort staff service superior they walk through cabin with juice and water three times per hour staff provide a good atmosphere and spirit in cabin and at all times kept toilets clean. IFE screens needs update too small and inferior image quality. On flight back to CPH captain made very thorough explanation prior to entering severe turbulence this info made many passengers feel better during the one hour rough ride.

Singapore Airlines customer review,8,J Lee,28th January 2015,Generally excellent courteous service but Entertainment system which offers a vast selection of films is the only downside to the flight. I am constantly pointing out to the flight crew out of every 4 flights I take on SIA I will experience problems with the entertainment system on at least 3. If not complete breakdown it is usually a problem with âstuttering (picture freezes and then catches up but cutting out parts of the film in the process) and/or the sound disappearing half way through a film. My family members share my experience. Consequently the problem is systemic and chronic. The fact that SIA does nothing to improve this demonstrates not only a clear lack of commitment to delivering a seamless enjoyable passenger experience but also a lack of consideration for the flight crew who have to spend so much time unnecessarily dealing with passengers complaints. By the way system reboots are a very frustrating and annoying thing for passengers to put up with. But this seems to be the cheap route they have chosen rather than fixing what is patently broken.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,7,G Penola,28th January 2015,Flew from SYD-SIN-IST Business Class on an ageing 777-200. Aircraft was the same all the way from Sydney to Istanbul. Whilst old the aircraft was very clean and well looked after. Food and Service were very good. The staff were wonderful. The Business Class seats/beds on this aircraft are a little hard compared to seats on other airlines which made it difficult to get comfortable on two night flights back to Turkey. IFE isn't as good as on other airlines or as good as SIA's newer aircraft but didn't affect the journey in a negative way. SIA would do well to offer pyjamas to customers in Business Class in the same way that Qantas do.,,,Business Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,8,Koh Chwee Lee,28th January 2015,I took Singapore Airlines SQ 609 from Seoul to Singapore on 25 January 2015. The inflight entertainment system on that flight was not working properly and I had to swap to another seat to continue watching my movie. From what I understood from the onboard announcement quite a number of passengers were affected as well.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,3,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,10,A Thenayan,26th January 2015,RUH-SIN and back. Outbound flight was March 20 and sadly SQ now stopped this flight. Check in was smooth and RUH was well RUH. SQ 455 left RUH at 11.55pm on time and arrived to SIN at around 1.25pm. The flight attendants are excellent. The food was great and the seat was very good! You could sleep comfortably (it wasn't a lie flat since it was on a A330) and the other positions were very comfortable. The IFE was up to date and entertaining. Everything was on time and arrival at Singapore was perfect. I arrived at T2 and it was empty with barely anyone else there. The flight back was also good (but more crowded) and it was on time and comfortable (but it was a day flight so I didn't sleep). I would recommend.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,10,David Lunt,26th January 2015,I flew from Amsterdam - Singapore - Singapore - Perth. The first leg was probably the best long haul flight I've been on. Service was excellent with drinks served regularly along with snacks and the meals where pretty good. The seat was really comfortable and plenty of leg room (I thought I was in Business class with the amount of leg room).,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,10,W O'Brien,26th January 2015,Flew economy on 12 November from Sydney to Singapore. The service was excellent. The staff are so kind and helpful. Busy looking after all passengers the whole flight. Seats very comfortable. I was in the first row after business class and had tons of leg room. The food wine and entertainment second to none. Toilets exceptionally clean with good products supplied.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,6,G Penola,23rd January 2015,"Flew IST-SIN SIN-SYD on B777-200. One of the aircraft had been ""refitted"". Both had quite hard seats. For the first sector I was seated in 51A which on a night flight gets a direct beam of light coming from the toilets on a regular basis. It's quite disturbing and I wouldn't recommend this seat to economy passengers in this part of the cabin. The inflight entertainment is dated and the screens quite small compared to other aircraft in the SIA fleet and other airlines particularly the second sector where the screen was exceptionally small. This must have been one of the oldest aircraft in the SIA fleet. It seems SIA reserve their ageing aircraft for the IST route. The inflight service on both legs of the journey was very average. I ordered a special meal so received my meal first however it took over an hour to get a drink to go with my meal which is served when the rest of the meals are served. I think there is some room for improvement here from SIA. I was surprised to have to remind the cabin crew about my missing drink as normally their service is second to none. The food was fine and well above average although the coffee not always hot. Check in staff were quite good at IST and as with almost every flight I have ever taken departing from Ataturk Airport it was a delayed departure - this flight by 45 minutes.",,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,,3,yes

The food was the best airplane meal I have had it was delicious and there was plenty of it. Seats where fine and the entertainment system on all 4 flights was up to date. Your boarding cards gets you discounts on various attractions in Singapore so keep them.

Singapore Airlines customer review,10,Tercon Bojan,21st January 2015,Singapore Airlines has finally upgraded their product on the Singapore - Bali route. Although the A330 is not my favourite plane the SQ A330 has the upgraded regional biz product in a 2-2-2 configuration which is way better than the old standard recliner biz seats on the 777-200.

Singapore Airlines customer review,5,M Hopwood,19th January 2015,Having just returned from spending Christmas and New Year with family in Australia travelling Singapore Airlines 777-300er from Manchester-Singapore-Perth flight SQ327. I was allocated the worst seat on the plane seat no. 56G on the back row my knees were pushed up against the seat in front couldn't stretch my legs out under the seat in front because the seat was so close had to keep getting up to stretch my legs. I would like to know who allocates the seat number its not the travel agent he can only request an aisle/window seat is it Singapore Airlines at the time of booking (booked 5 months in advance) was it the only seat available? Is it the people who book 48 hours before on line or is it at check out at Manchester. I would have thought the back row was reserves for people on stand by or last minute bookings.

Breakfast was not hot but just lukewarm. For that reason I was not keen in eating it. In my humble opinion that is the product is totally overpriced and it selling it on the name only. After the emerging of the middle eastern carriers you can see the features and benefits other airlines give you. Other airlines talk about. Please don't get me wrong the airline is acceptable and is better than other airlines but compared to what you pay and what you get I am sorry I would not like to buy this product again.,,,Business Class,,,3.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,,2,no
Singapore Airlines customer review,10,Jerome Chia,14th January 2015,Singapore to Bangkok on flight SQ970. Check-in was quick and the staff are very friendly. The inflight entertainment was wonderful as it is been updated not long ago there a lot of new movies. The business class seats were great - big and comfortable. I order the book the cook - really good although an average portion. I will definitely fly with Singapore Airlines in the future.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,9,V Sitaraman,14th January 2015,I am a very satisfied frequent traveler on SQ and this review only covers the way they serve their special meals in general and the inconvenience this procedure causes on short flights. I noted down the exact service timings on a 75 minute flight (SQ959) between Jakarta and Singapore on 4 Dec 14. Flight take off 15.05 special meals service started 15.15 I was served at 15.50 and my tray was taken away at 16.03 when I had not quite finished the meal. If you order a special meal you will be embarrassed to receive it too early when your neighbors have even not received their drinks. The tray-by-tray special meal service takes so much time that those receiving a standard meal have very little time to eat it at least on short flights. In the glory days of Malaysian Airlines (which I almost exclusively flew between 1998 to 2009) somehow they would bring the special and regular meals together so that all passengers were served at the same time. Wonder if SQ could think of some way to reduce the time lag between special meal and regular meal service? This is not a complaint but a suggestion.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,3,S Lucato,14th January 2015,LAX-NRT-SIN with no ground customer service to be found anywhere. The usually short refuelling stop in NRT became an overnight 17 hr delay due to Engine problems. Singapore Airlines held us on the plane for over 4 hrs and insisted on serving us the inflight dinner rather than let the passengers disembark. The hotel provided for Economy class was (Nikko Narita) was rather on the run-down side. First and Business where hosted at the local Hilton and another hotel (Did not catch the name). We had a connection to MDC the next morning in Singapore which we missed. That connection only flies every other day so that we had to stay two days in Singapore over Christmas rather than on our vacation. The biggest problem was that no-one on the phone or the ground staff in NRT could provide us with a new itinerary to our destination. To add insult to injury the first phone representative insisted that my flight had taken off as planned even though I had called almost 3 hrs after the delay started. The second one was even worse in first refusing to help at all as he claimed I had deviated from my booked LAX-SIN itinerary. It was only after some complaining that he finally realized that NRT is indeed on the route. Not that he had any further information to offer after that other than saying I would get more information in Singapore. Once finally in Singapore the representative at the gate who was supposed to have our onward information did not and had us wait for another length of time at the transfer desk in Singapore. There finally I was handed the boarding passes to our final destination and hotel vouchers. I am Executive Platinum with American Airlines and have seen my fair share of breakdowns and delays. However without fail an AA representative on the phone has been able to give me my new route/times within minutes of the official announcement of the delay. Onboard service on Singapore Airlines is certainly better than on AA. That said I will gladly trade in a bit of comfort for the knowledge that I am being taken care in a timely manner if something does not go to plan.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,3,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,6,L Berney,14th January 2015,SFO-HK I was disappointed in the overall experience. It appears to me the airline is cutting corners and not keeping up with the ME carriers. The seat although wide is not particularly comfortable in the seated position. The fully reclined position was better but the bed was hard. They would do well to add a comforter on the sleeping surface to provide a softer experience. They used to provide an amenities kit- no longer. The food too was just not as good as it used to be. If they want to retain their ratings they better spend a bit more on their business class product.,,,Business Class,,,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,3,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,6,J Hampton,14th January 2015,Travelled AKL-SIN on the old 777 with the incline bed. There was no topper pad for the seat so very uncomfortable to try and sleep. This is a 10 hour flight so it was not up to scratch. These days you really expect more in Business class. There are also 6 seats across so there is not a lot of room to spread out. The food was only just acceptable but as the flight left at 1am we didn't feel like much anyway. I think Singapore need to review their fares on this aircraft as it was barely a step up from premium economy on other airlines. The way back SIN-CHC is the refurbished 777 with a lie flat bed and 4 seats across. A quite different experience. A lot more room and even though it feels a bit weird to sleep diagonally it was fine. 2 comfy pillows. I had tried to book the cook but I didn't think it had worked online as couldn't see it in our booking but on arriving home found confirmation emails that it had but we didn't get our requested meals on the plane so don't know what happened there. The food was really good anyway. Service was fantastic from the crew in fact it was the best part of the experience. In Singapore they allowed our two sons (21 and 17)who were travelling with us but in economy to come into the lounge as we had 6 hours there which was really appreciated. On both trips the movie selection was dismal and the only amenities given out were a pair of slippers and an eye mask . There were some toothbrushes in the bathroom but they were all out on the way to Sin. This was our 1st time travelling business with Singapore and have to say was slightly underwhelmed compared to our other experiences.,,,Business Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,,3,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,4,Krishnan Chitoor,14th January 2015,CCU to SIN in the first week of January 2015. Had a seat in Row 36 and as part of the boarding process was made to stand in a queue (one for different sets of rows) for forty minutes. This is a ridiculous ground staff strategy to ensure organised boarding. Considering the flight duration is ~4 hours with a pre 5 a.m. landing the cabin lights were on for most of the flight for catering and duty-free shopping. For a 5-star airline the handling of boarding and the management of the cabin left a lot to be desired.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,,3,no
Singapore Airlines customer review,10,Lau Ni,5th January 2015,Took the A380 Suite HKG-SIN on 19 Dec. Flight departed slightly late but arrived on time. Great service and seat - amazingly comfortable seat. The only downside is the lack of storage. Could only store handbag under the ottoman. IFE choices were extensive and updated. Was given free 15MB WiFi. Pre-ordered Book the Cook's Lobster Thermidor and it deserves its online reputation. The rest of the courses were mediocre - more like Business Class food. Service was excellent as expected of SQ except that the FA forgot to return me my coat at the end of the flight causing me to walk halfway to Arrival only to turn back upon realizing my forgotten coat.,,,First Class,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,7,J Stevens,5th January 2015,BKK-SIN-MEL. Of course the service could not be faulted. The main problem we had with our return trip is that we had medium haul 777 and on the way over the much more comfortable long haul product. The medium haul has an inclined bed seat that is far too hard and not at all comfortable whilst the long haul has the fully flat (and deliciously soft) bed- more like a cubby than a bed). It was a bit disappointing. As it was a midnight flight both ways the ides of offering meals just after take off or two hours before landing is a great one but the breakfasts on both trips were terrible on the way home inedible. I know the food in economy is much better.,,,Business Class,,,3.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,,4,yes

Singapore Airlines customer review,9,Thomas Lundberg,31st December 2014,Heathrow-Singapore-Auckland return Nov/Dec 2014. All four sectors were on the A380 and I had economy seating on the main deck for two trips and on the upper deck for the other two. Smoothest take-offs I have experienced and smooth quiet flights in general. Excellent service from flight attendants who treat you like they want you to fly with them again. They would come back and check on people who had questions or didn't understand how to operate the entertainment system. Adequate legroom and very good entertainment system to help you pass the hours. Most meals were excellent and flight attendants came through at non-serving times to offer snack items. Only minor issues: the entertainment system would lag a bit on playback of films and the tray table/seating areas could use a bit of a deep clean. Otherwise this was the first time I had flown Singapore Airlines in nearly five years and it remains as good as I remember - my favourite airline. Highly recommended.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,8,Dawn Ambadan,31st December 2014,Flew from Melbourne to Singapore and back. Boeing 777-300 on MEL-SIN had one of the oldest IFE screens I have ever seen on SIA (flying since 2010). Priority meal for other passengers around me meant I had to wait for ages for a meal. SIN to MEL was a brand new A330-300 and had nice IFE and dinner served on board was the best I have had inflight. Serving dinner in the late night and keeping lights on meant there is no way you can sleep properly. I will still fly SIA because of their hospitality and cabin comfort.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,5,Laurence Baillie,22nd December 2014,I flew from Melbourne to Singapore on a 777. Singapore to Delhi on the A380 and Singapore to Adelaide on the A330. In terms of seat space the oldest one ie the 777 was the most comfortable. I am 1m73 and the Airbus both felt cramped. On the other hand the inflight entertainment on the 777 was pretty poor with scarce visibility of the screen which makes it impossible to read subtitles on foreign films. The IFE on the Airbus was much better. The cabin and toilets were clean and the crew was polite and efficient on all flights. My main complaints are first with the food. I ordered a Lacto-Ovo vegetarian meal which was pretty standard. On all the outbound flights (and I'm not a fussy person) the meals were almost inedible. The other problem is that as they serve the special meals a long time ahead of the normal meals I ended up sitting in an upright position with my tray for over 90 mins not good. On the Airbus the trays are too big for the foldable table and therefore it keeps on sliding it's really annoying. The white wine was also not very good. My second complaint would be with the ground staff. They were particularly unhelpful at check-in in Melbourne. All I wanted was 2 seats together but they made such a big deal of it all and because I had booked under the Virgin Australia flight numbers I couldn't check in online 48hrs prior so that wasn't my fault. Plus on the outbound we only had 1 hr transit and because the flight was delayed we ended up having to run between the 2 terminals with no help from ground staff whatsoever so that was very poor customer service considering the delay was the airline's fault to start with. We did make our connection but it could have been handled a bit better. Overall I am disappointed and didn't find this airline to be that much better than any other ones. Not worth the extra money anyway.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,,3,no
Singapore Airlines customer review,10,Jonathan Hiing,22nd December 2014,B777-300ER (SIN-LHR). Overall the flight was fabulous. From pre-take off to airborne to landing all cabin crews make their very best effort to keep the service went well throughout the flight. Cabin crews were attentive friendly and helpful. Cabin crews were always appeared in the cabin and went around to serve passengers some drinks and snacks after the meal services. The food was delicious. The cabin was very comfortable especially the lighting. I was lucky enough to board their brand new Boeing 777-300ER. Take off and landing were smooth without much noises. Also the lavatory were in clean condition all the time. This is the airline worth flying with and I would recommend to the others. Although I was flying Economy class I felt I was being treated as a business class or first class passengers.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,10,Jonathan Soon Hiing,22nd December 2014,Paris CDG - Singapore SIN A380. Everything was fantastic. The flight was on time. Cabin crews were very attentive and friendly throughout the flight. Food was good and toilet was clean all the time. Cabin crew were soft spoken with great language proficiency. My only complaint is to upgrade their inflight entertainment like the one they have in 777-300ER. Have flown with other major airlines to the majority of European cities SQ is still my favorite. Overall I am very satisfied with the airline and a big thumb up to the crew members. I would fly with SQ and recommend this airline to my friends and relatives.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,4,Tercon Bojan,22nd December 2014,Singapore Airlines is slowly losing it on their long-haul business class compared to other Middle Eastern airlines. I used to love this seat 7 years ago when they launched it however today it doesn't measure up to its competition. Especially given the price. You always tend to sit sideways which is discomforting after a while especially on this long-haul flight from Singapore to LA via Tokyo on the A380. This must have been one of their oldest A380's for the seat was tattered and basically a lot of wear-and-tear was evident in the cabin and lavatories. Moreover the IFE didn't work in my seat which was very annoying on this long flight. They tried to fix it onboard as well as during the Tokyo layover with no success. Since the flight was full I couldn't change seats. The food though was outstanding.,,,Business Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,,2,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,8,P Neill,18th December 2014,SQ Flight 346 SIN - ZRH on the A380. The flight leaves very early in the morning at 01.30. Singapore Airlines should really change the meal service concept on this flight. Having to endure a full service this early in the morning is just cruel torture when passengers would actually would just want the lights to go out and go to sleep. Why not hand out meal vouchers to passengers with plenty of time in transit to eat at a restaurant at SIN airport and then serve only a light snack on the plane after takeoff. Seats in business class look impressive but are unsupportive in the sitting position and too hard and too short when used as a bed. F&B service as well as inflight entertainment were very good. Crew were also doing a good job. Service overall however was slower at the rear end of the business compartment. Probably also because the top deck was a two class business/economy layout and I was sitting at the far end of the service rotation.,,,Business Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,,3,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,9,Layla Maharani,18th December 2014,I flew from Jakarta-Singapore-Bangkok. The check in from Soekarno-Hatta and Changi was handled quickly but it took a little bit longer in Suvarnabhumi. Staff were friendly and hospitable. The inflight entertainment was wonderful! I like their travel magazine. The economy seats were standard but kind of uncomfortable (for me). The food was good with an average portion. There were no delays and they gave me and my family who were also travelling with me a S$20 voucher for every passenger (didn't know what promo that was). The price was also satisfactory and worth the flight experience. Will definitely fly with SQ again.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,5,yes

Singapore Airlines customer review,9,Krish Mohan,10th December 2014,SQ 15 - Sep 29. SQ402 - Oct 1. SQ5357 Oct 24. SQ16 - Oct 25 2014. I have been flying SQ from San Francisco to India since 1990 when they had their 747-400 Megatop almost once or twice a year. Other airlines have cut down on service rudeness of the cabin crew has increased and fares have skyrocketed. In SQ the service and amenities always amaze me a very polite and professional crew and new equipment. The only complaint I have is how they serve the meals in the Economy class. Special Meals like Asian Vegetarian almost begins an hour before the regular meals and passengers on Long Haul Flights need to be sitting with an upright seat for more than 90 minutes with an empty tray in front of them. Aperitifs for Specials Meals are served well after 30 minutes after their meal when the food/drinks cart makes it way. Similarly the dessert (which is usually ice cream) comes an hour after meals.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,9,C Chan,4th December 2014,BNE-SIN-ICN and return on Economy. Consistently great service in all four flights the cabin crew were very attentive. Food and drinks were excellent in generous servings and the movie selection on IFE is more than acceptable. I always love their signature cocktail Singapore Sling. The seat was a lot more spacious than I expected after having flown with other airlines in the US the month before. I thoroughly enjoyed all flights although having an empty seat next to me in all 4 flights might be one of the key contributing factors. I am a frequent flyer and I have to say this trip is one of the best I have had.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5,yes

Singapore Airlines customer review,9,Phang Jun Xian,1st December 2014,Flew from Singapore to Beijing as flight SQ802 on the 15th of November 2014 and returning back to Singapore as flight SQ807 on the 22nd of November 2014. It was my first time on the Singapore Airlines Airbus A380 in upper deck economy. Boarding was quick and efficient for both sectors having it about 40 minutes before departure and with boarding queues ending quickly. Legroom was excellent (I am 170cm tall). Food on the Beijing sector was delicious however it was not served hot thus making it a little disappointing. Service was great as the crew smiled gracefully during meal service. However a crew forgot to refill my orange juice (She did not have enough orange juice so she told me she was going to get some for me but did not come). The entertainment was spectacular with tons of movies and music. However the movie tends to lag when viewed. So I settled down to listening to music instead. The seats are comfortable but the pillow is too big so I feel they should make it smaller thus having it to use lesser space. The return sector was much better. The crew were more friendly and efficient compared to the Beijing sector. My dad's luggage had some issues so he told me to board the plane first. As I boarded the plane the steward welcomed me warmly and kindly guided me to my seat also helping me to find an available container to store mine and my father's large carry on. Food was much better on the return sector on the flight as it was served much warmer. I had a great experience with Singapore Airlines and I would recommend it anytime.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,,4,yes

Lots of legroom IFE poor as screen too dark despite maximum adjustment and passenger announcements not loud enough. Staff ever helpful and smiling. Food on menu not great but snacks were. Flight on time. Then SIN to LHR on A380. Seating hard less legroom and very cold but preferable to being too warm. Needed the blanket! Food much better and staff excellent as usual. IFE had good choices but screen repeatedly froze and others experienced the same. Managed a good amount of sleep as plane so quiet but had to request eye mask and ear plugs. Why don't they ditch the stupid socks in the amenity pack which I have hardly ever seen anyone wearing and include eye masks and earplugs along with the toothbrush? Flight on time. Will definitely use them again. My 8th flight with SIA.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,,5,yes

Flight left on time boarding was smooth and excellent service on board. Flight attendant extremely friendly and approachable great food and drinks (being served wine on a glass and not on a plastic cup in economy was amazing) and wonderful entertainment (they even had Italian series in it). My only critique would be more leg room. Would surely recommend them to others and look forward to flying SA again.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,9,A Barnes,17th November 2014,LHR-SIN-DPS. Flew on the A380 and booked the preferred seating for extra legroom. While this was a blessing the reduction in seat width wasn't ideal. The seats were a little too firm for my liking. Other than that the experience was fantastic. Entertainment choice was plentiful the food was good and the cabin crew were excellent.

Singapore Airlines customer review,4,B Glover,17th November 2014,Rome to Perth October 17. Older 777. Good seats. IFE still bad but everything else good on to Rome to Singapore leg. The Singapore to Perth leg was not what you would expect from Singapore Airlines. The crew were really rushing everything. Not sure why as it was 5 hour flight. It looked like they had trainees on board and the older crew were exerting their authority. The cabin crew were almost running between points on the plane. The coffee service was with the meal and the jug was flayed around with speed and not much care. There was no respite this sort of rush continued all the way to landing. I am sure this is an isolated incident I will still fly with them though.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,,4,yes

The food entertainment and service was all very good and I particularly enjoyed the wide selection of the latest movies and music that they had to offer. All flights departed and landed on time. Food was nice but the breakfasts were not great. On the flights between Oz and Singapore we flew on the 777-330 with a modern clean interior and a very spacious amount of leg room possibly the most leg room I have ever had onboard a long-haul flight. The flight between Shanghai and Singapore was the worst - with very little leg room and felt quite cramped.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,,4,yes

Singapore Airlines customer review,7,T Ney,31st October 2014,PER-SIN-AMS in business class first leg on 777-200ER refitted and second leg on 777-300ER. The two things that really set SQ apart are the catering and staff service. This is really excellent food nice drinks and perfect service. Changi airport also remains a nice hub but starts showing its age. However coming back to SQs one cannot deny that the seats and IFE are not on par anymore with big rival Emirates with whom I flew the outbound leg. I actually quite liked the older style seat on the SQ 777-200ER in a 2-2-2 layout which is perfectly fine and even better than Emirates' product on their 777s. But I still do not like the very wide seat in 1-2-1 as can be found on SQ's 77W and A380. The seat is not good for lounging to wide and short for sitting and in order to use the ottoman one must sit diagonally and lacks good support in the back. Also having to stand up in order to convert the seat into a bed (and back) is not practical. The bed is hard and too short for me (I am 192cm). The IFE cannot compete anymore versus what the ME carriers are offering. Smaller screen less choice and most unexplainable: no IFE on offer before take-off while with other carriers one can board early and already enjoy half a movie before boarding taxi and take-off are over. Anyway flying business with SQ is of course still a treat but others do much better today. Am curious to discover SQ's new business class product which is now being rolled out for its longer range routes.,,,Business Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,9,Walker Christopher,31st October 2014,My wife and I flew SQ256/S366 BNE-SIN-FCO in October and returned on SQ365/255 in November. The outbound flight from BNE was excellent. The staff could not be faulted. The seats and the IFE were excellent. We took advantage of book the cook from Singapore and the food was of a very high standard and well presented. The only stumble on the SIN-FCO sector is the old style IFE. My wife slept comfortably on the lie down bed The return from FCO was good - excellent service and good meals but once again - old IFE. We had chosen book the cook for the sector SIN-BNE but it was a let down - overheated and not very palatable or well presented. The staff did the best they could but it was a let down after 3 great sectors.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,10,Robert Adams,28th October 2014,SQ306 16/10/2014 SIN-LHR. I recently had a block of five flights with Singapore Airlines. The first thing you notice is that they have a modern fleet of aircraft's the cabins are fresh and clean and importantly use the latest technology for passenger use. The service is extremely good onboard the stewardesses are very friendly and efficient as they serve passengers and smile which makes a big difference. The new aircraft's have the better seats they are quite wide for economy the backs give good support but the most important thing for me was the cushioning it seemed about right and after a 14 hour flight on a 777 I found it to be one of the best seats I have sat in on a plane. All flights were very good and I would use them again.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,7,K Evo,28th October 2014,Flew Singapore from Brisbane to Paris via Singapore and then return on the same path. Check in staff and flight attendants on all trips were very professional and helpful. Air con hardly worked between Brisbane and Singapore and was most uncomfortable. Also very disappointed (and annoyed) when offered peanuts as a snack despite telling the airline that I was anaphylactic to peanuts! After telling the flight attendant he was most apologetic and gave me and my family potato chips instead. Overall the meals were ok - especially good from Paris! Flew on the A380 between Singapore and Paris and there was plenty of room so were able to spread out and have a proper sleep! Flight attendants were most attentive and seemed to rush up and offer you more food or drink as soon as you showed any sign of waking up. Overall quite a good experience and I would recommend this airline!,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,10,Modesti Antonella,28th October 2014,Simply perfect! Zurich to Singapore and back from Denpasar to Zurich via Singapore with my family. I bought the tickets online through their web site taking advantage of a special offer they extremely cheap. Upon reservation I was immediately allowed to choose the seats and special meals (I am vegetarian). Every flight was perfectly on time or landed early. Seats are comfortable and inflight entertainment excellent. My special meal arrived at the same time of other meals warm and very good other meals were also good. Large variety of drinks and good wine. Several times during the flight they offered water juices and snacks. I was travelling with a 4yr old child who was continuously spoiled by the cabin crew with gifts and additional food. We asked for sandwiches and snacks several times and they offered them immediately. Getting in the aircraft on the way back I remarked that the seat belt on my seat was broken. Ground staff arrived immediately they dismantled the seat and changed the belt. The whole operation did not take more than 5 minutes! A special word to the cabin crew it was not my first flight with Singapore Airlines and I am always astonished by how lovely caring and professional they are! They are always smiling never get nervous or stressed and are extremely efficient they never forget something you ask them!,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,10,Robert Adams,28th October 2014,SQ306 16/10/2014 SIN-LHR. I recently had a block of five flights with Singapore Airlines. The first thing you notice is that they have a modern fleet of aircraft's the cabins are fresh and clean and importantly use the latest technology for passenger use. The service is extremely good onboard the stewardesses are very friendly and efficient as they serve passengers and smile which makes a big difference. The new aircraft's have the better seats they are quite wide for economy the backs give good support but the most important thing for me was the cushioning it seemed about right and after a 14 hour flight on a 777 I found it to be one of the best seats I have sat in on a plane.

Singapore Airlines customer review,9,P Dong,28th October 2014,JFK-FRA-SIN-PVG and back to JFK. A380 on JFK-SIN and 777-300ER on SIN-PVG. Everything with Singapore Airlines and Changi Airport was superb. Great entertainment system great food great service great airplanes great economy seats. The food is delicious for asian taste they are one of the best I've seen. My feeder flight was delayed on my way to PVG so I missed my PVG-SIN flight. The SIA staff in PVG changed my ticket without any question or fee. The inflight entertainment on FRA-SIN leg was not functioning properly. When disembarking in SIN the airline staff gave every passenger a gift of leather wallet as compensation and apologized personally to everyone. I am very impressed by Singapore Airlines. They deserve to be a 5 star airline. I will definitely fly SIA again. If there was one thing bad is that I didn't really like their check-in staff in JFK.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,5,Harrison David,22nd October 2014,Travelled LHR-SIN-LHR on A380. Everything fine apart from the Air-Con at the rear of the plane on the upper deck. Paid extra for seats with leg room but was frozen both ways (esp legs and feet) We were told that this is due to the exit doors and the chilling equipment in the galley. Was shown the overall cabin temp (which said 24 but felt like -24 in your seat). SQ really needs to look at this but it maybe an Airbus thing rather than SQ.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,8,Lau Ni,22nd October 2014,Travelled HKG-SIN on 30 September on the A380. Flight departed around 30 minutes later than scheduled but overall the flight was smooth and we arrived on time. Seat was uncomfortably wide but made better by the 2 cushions on each side. It was a pity that the seat including the storage compartments looked dirty old and worn. Maintenance could have been better - have seen older but cleaner A330 from Asiana. Food-wise is the usual Business Class fare nothing spectacular but was of good quality and quantity. Service was prompt and friendly.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,8,Zachary Ho,20th October 2014,Singapore to Milan Rome to Singapore. The flight to Milan was a Boeing 777-300. Service was again excellent throughout the flight and deserved praise. Food and IFE was great. The return flight from Rome was old model Boeing 777-200ER. The plane although looked new on the outside was old on the inside. IFE screen was poor and far outdated then the one they currently use on their newer models. Though I felt more comfortable in the seats. However I do not know why SIA still doesn't retire this old model. Clearly footrest seats and even the IFE was in a need of repair. Service on this flight was not as great as the previous flight. Request were sometimes miss and food options ran out something i had not experience before with SIA. A letdown this time for the return flight. I would still recommend based on the outbound flight from Singapore.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,7,Rafi Pramadio,20th October 2014,Flew with Singapore Airlines in September between CGK and SIN then proceeded to PEN with their subsidiary SilkAir (return). As an athlete I had to travel with my equipment which are large in size and heavy. On the first leg the check in process was smooth as there were no lines although the plane was full. We were scheduled to fly on a 777-200/200ER but due to maintenance issues they instead used a 777-300ER which has better seats IFE and was spotless clean inside out. Boarding process was quick and flight attendants greeted everyone with a smile and addressed some of the passengers by name. What disappointed me was that they did not switch on the much expected IFE until almost halfway through the journey and to my surprise the food was both below standard (I tried both options). On the leg back they used the 777-300 classic series which was also clean inside out. Seamless boarding process yet again and great food. I shopped from the SilverKris magazine for the special F1 merchandise and it was a smooth process as well. But to my disappointment they did not switch on the IFE at all. For the time being I will opt for SkyTeam carriers Garuda Indonesia and Air France which allows me to pay less but get the same results.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,3,no
Singapore Airlines customer review,1,C Dickinson,20th October 2014,Return trip to Adelaide via Singapore. Would not use this airline again nor would I recommend travelling with Singapore Airlines. The seating was uncomfortable and cramped extremely poor inflight entertainment the food was an ice cream dessert that was still frozen and inedible. One of the meals contained pork so tough I could not cut through it. Another meal that was supposed to be beef just consisted mainly of gristle. The only good part of all four flights was that most of the cabin staff were efficient and helpful. I found the whole experience extremely disappointing and certainly poor value for money.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,,1,no

Singapore Airlines customer review,10,S Flynn,13th October 2014,BNE-SIN and then Silk Air SIN-CEB. Seating comfortable and the food and overall service was great. What can you say about the cabin crew they are above the best both directions the flight was well on time and connections and transfers met. The overall service provided across all levels of both Singapore and Silk Air exemplary. An airline is only as good as the crew that it employs and to that end they are the best in what they do.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,7,Khalid Ahmed,13th October 2014,ZRH-SIN-SGN and back with A380/777-200. All in all nice flights with very good cabin service and an unbeatable Changi Airport. Positive: Staff very attentive and professional food of good quality good IFE reliability and safety. Great and well-priced stop-over program which has a lot to offer. Negatives: Though seat pitch of 32 in is not bad the seats on the A380 are not very comfortable sleeping is quite difficult. For the price you pay for SIA they could have gone easily for 33-34 inches. The cabin is wide and silent the windows are a bit far from the seat. The food is nice though i ate better food on Qatar for example. The 777-200 are a bit old and worn out not up to date. Though SIA is one of the best airlines I've flown with I don't think they offer the best Economy experience there are better products on the markets like Qatar Asiana or Garuda or Malaysia Airlines.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,3,yes

Singapore Airlines customer review,9,T Harland,13th October 2014,The overnight Airbus A380 flight from Singapore to London Heathrow on Saturday October 4th was one of the best flights we have experienced. The seats were comfortable the leg room was adequate and the meals or snacks were very good. Best of all was the frequency with which drinks were brought round so that the demand from passengers using the call button was minimal ensuring very little disturbance for the 13 hour night flight. The 11.30 pm departure and 6.30 am arrival helps get over the jet lag provided one can sleep during the flight.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5,yes

Singapore Airlines customer review,2,Angela Cockburn,28th September 2014,We took four long haul flights with Singapore Airlines in June and July and were frankly disappointed. On one flight they shut down the cabin for sleep at 3.30 on a bright sunny afternoon and insisted the window shade be drawn when I would have liked to see out. After that cabin staff disappeared and only offered water twice in the next six hours or so. On two very long flights only one meal and a snack was offered and once it took three quarters of an hour to get a second drink after meal service was over and the aisle was clear. On one flight the air con was set on an extremely high temperature most unpleasant. We paid extra to fly with them on the basis of their reputation for service which was poor. Meal service was slow and the choices of food ran out on two flights. In contrast a one hour flight with a regional airline managed to serve a full meal and two drinks between Manchester and Heathrow so it can be done!,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,,1,no
Singapore Airlines customer review,2,P Mandarino,28th September 2014,I have recently flown HKG-SIN-HKG on B777-200 economy. Singapore airlines not only did not meet the expectations but were also below the average level of other airlines. The plane was old. The seats were old and the in-flight entertainment system was outdated. The selection of movies was very limited. The food served on board was basic. The meals were served long after take off forcing you to be awake for the most part of the flight and fall asleep just when it is time to land. Never again.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,1,no
Singapore Airlines customer review,5,Wilde Margaret,24th September 2014,I boarded the Airbus flying from London to Singapore on 18 September it was two hours late owing to technical difficulties. Sometimes these things happen. However I was sitting in seat 41c. From the start the air conditioning was frightful. A freezing cold breeze blew around all of the passengers near the back of the cabin while the passengers towards the front complained that it was too hot. Also the stench from the toilets was unbearable and seemed to be wafted out of the toilets at regular intervals during the trip. I did not experience this on any of the aircraft's I flew with both to Amsterdam six weeks previously or on the flight home from Singapore to New Zealand. Although spoken to the staff were unwilling to acknowledge that there was something wrong. On the Singapore to NZ part of the trip I also tried to charge my Air iPad but it would not charge on any of the seats near where I was sitting. The steward said there had been difficulties with Apple products. Potential customers need to know this as it could be important to work during a long haul trip. I had been relatively pleased with Singapore Airlines but my experience on the Airbus has left me wandering if I would fly with them again.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,3,no

Singapore Airlines customer review,9,L Ayasse,14th September 2014,"NYC to Frankfurt to Singapore. SQ25 8/23. Singapore to Heathrow to Boston. SQ308 8/30. We were very impressed with Singapore Airlines service from beginning to end. The food/beverage service was unlike any we have ever had on an airplane. The flight crew was more attentive than I have experienced at an elegant restaurant! The access to and variety of entertainment (movies and music) exceeded our expectations. The ""little extras"" (such as hot towels at the beginning and end of each flight socks and toothbrushes) were a pleasant and welcome surprise. Overall Singapore Airlines made a grueling 24hr flight much more tolerable! The only criticisms I would offer are the poor leg room (particularly in the middle section) and the location of the security check-in prevented the use of restrooms restaurants and shopping after going through security. We usually check in early enough to ensure there is ample time to handle any issues that could arise and then we use the restrooms/eat/fill water bottles/shop/etc after we are all set for the flight.",,,Economy Class,,,2.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,8,Zeng Yixie,14th September 2014,Sep 5th and Sep 9th PVG-SIN return trip. A380-800 on all legs. I have travelled with Singapore Airlines several times. I think they are on a downward slope. Both trips were on an A380-800(9V-SKK) the inflight entertainment was a little bit old and wasn't a touch screen. The seat pitch is little bit narrow and I'm 175cm. Next SIA have kept a lot of traditions such as the hot towel service menu distributed to all classes of passengers etc. Catering quality in SIA is still high food was freshly prepared beverages were plentiful wines and cocktails are never out of stock. Most of the cabin crews provide service with a smile. Overall a nice trip and good experience.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,9,Tercon Bojan,10th September 2014,The Amsterdam flight is on the retrofitted 777-200ER which is excellent except for the business class IFE which is still the old version. It seems that SQ has decided not to upgrade the IFE on this retrofit thus the movie selection is not as grand the user interface is old and the pix quality of the screen is lower. I have always loved the SQ biz class seat for I find it a good balance between privacy and comfort. The meals were superb as was the service.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,,3,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,9,Morgan Ianto,6th September 2014,I flew Singapore Airlines 777-300ER - on 21st August - Manchester Airport to Singapore on SQ327 then Singapore to Sydney on SQ 211 and I can only praise all the cabin crew working on all the sectors for their professionalism politeness attentiveness when assisting passengers and serving meals drinks and snacks. The food served was of great quality tasty and hot and throughout the long sectors the cabin staff were constantly serving beverages and snacks. Inflight entertainment had newly released films.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,9,Brian Adam Pratama,6th September 2014,Flown with SQ from CGK-SIN-CDG last December in their B777-200 and A380-800 respectively. Easy breezy departing flight from CGK-SIN check-in was quick and professional (apart from CGK airport condition with their on-going development). Arrived in SIN surprised with a 20$ gift voucher to spend in Changi (SQ flights only). The next flight from SIN-CDG on 'THE' A380 (appropriately decorated with some mistletoe) was nothing but sheer pleasure. Although their seats are rock-hard the legroom is all that I could ask from a cattle class (I am 184cm tall that is a smidge over 6 feet). The IFE was good even though it is a little bit outdated it was still decent. The food? Inappropriately good! You should try the infamous Singapore Sling too! The service was well-mannered well- presented and well-trained cabin crews. The same goes with the return leg.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,8,K Cai,1st September 2014,Flew MEL-SIN-FRA and Munich-SIN-MEL in Aug 2013. Excellent staffing food and IFE system. 1st flight automatic upgrade to bulkhead seat which had so much room! Dream flight. 2nd flight got put on last row windows seat. Nightmarish as so limited room! Plane on 2nd flights both times had severe turbulence to extent the food- servicing was suspended. Plane was old had leaking liquid from a baggage door! Nevertheless given amenity pack and offered plenty of drinks etc. Very good experience especially when I got to Changi airport.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,2,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,8,Jezrel Sabaduquia,1st September 2014,I have flown with them for quite some time now and while their service is usually robotic impersonal and lacking warmth flying with other airlines makes you appreciate how Singapore just does it right. Recently flew from MNL-SIN-DEL. MNL-SIN on a fully loaded B777 the aircraft is up for retirement but it is spotlessly clean and well maintained. The IFE was ancient but for such a short flight I did not mind it. Food was decent and cabin crew were as efficient and reliable as one should expect from SQ. Had a 6 hour layover in Changi which is without a doubt SQ's best asset. It's an airport beyond compare and would not mind a longer layover. Flight to DEL on the A380 with less than 100 passengers. Cabin crew were very laid back and allowed passengers to move about the cabin. The seats were extremely comfortable and food was excellent. Service calls were answered in record time and while one of the flight attendants was a tad cold one of the lead flight attendants embodied professionalism and warmth which made up for it. IFE kept malfunctioning and the movie kept pausing every 30 seconds or so which was annoying. Besides that one minor issue I would fly SQ again. They are extremely reliable their hard product is among the best and while their service is inconsistent when it comes to friendliness their efficiency is one of the best out there.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,4,D Rose,28th August 2014,SQ975 BKK-SIN A330 J - I was looking forward to my first flight with Singapore in what some consider the best business class in the sky. The seats on A330 were spacious and comfortable but the table surface is slippery and your meal tray will slide off if you don't hold onto it. This can be prevented by the use of a tablecloth as found in other airlines' business class. The previous passenger's socks were still in the footwell so cabin grooming could use some work. The meal was good but drinks service was infrequent. All in all this experience was comparable to a domestic business class on a US carrier - certainly far short of the Singapore Airlines I was expecting.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,,2,no
Singapore Airlines customer review,8,D Rose,28th August 2014,SQ978 SIN-DPS B772 J. This was the second leg of the journey from BKK to DPS and despite the outdated regional J seats on this aircraft type it was far more enjoyable than the previous leg. The crew were friendly and professional and the service was very nicely done. We were called by name throughout the flight and rarely did a glass get below half full. Overall quite satisfactory.,,,Business Class,,,2.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,9,Y Lau,26th August 2014,Flew with Singapore Airlines for the first time from HKG-SIN and back. What a contrast from the airlines in North America.

Singapore Airlines customer review,7,C Gilbert,26th August 2014,6 flights in July. Auckland - Singapore SGN-BKK Da Nang - SGN. SGN - Cebu. Cebu - SGN and SGN-AKL. All were full. At least 3 were late to varying degrees. On at least one occasion I suspect the delay was not due to congestion at Da Nang for goodness sake but due to late arrival. Only the first flight seemed a bit superior. That seemed to me to be small differences eg - a decent filled roll as a snack but mainly the staff worked hard all the time and seemed to have a service ethic. The food well - Take the coffee cup the wine glass the tub of water and the roll off the tray and really you are not left with much. Surprisingly the food on the SIN - BKK flight at 1600 hours was much the same as on a long flight. However usually it was a dry entree or a few small pieces of fruit plus in effect a snack box sized meal. The Cebu - SGN flight arriving at around 2030 about 1.5 hours late offered a snack box with 3 small cubes of chicken and a cm deep flavoured rice and perhaps a piece of broccoli - most children eat more. Spirits were not offered on the longer flights although they were available out of view nor wine top ups. A beer amounted to perhaps 80 mls that is 4 pours to the can. A little generosity goes a long way as does the impression of parsimony. Overall much the same as other airlines. The best food was on a Vietnam Air 1.25 hour flight where they managed to serve and clear a good meal. Although Singapore seemed to cope with routine any variation seemed to cause problems. One confirmed flight was rescheduled and a second rescheduled to another with a stopover making it two hours longer. Both were weeks in advance. I don't believe either flight was in fact rescheduled rather I was bumped. In the latter case although I was notified of a rescheduling it was much later that I noticed it was in fact a route change. On the return flight which had been altered some months before I had paid for a preferred seat. This was confirmed that I had the same seat. However in fact on the day I was given a non-preferred seat in the centre. This was drawn to the cabin crews’attention and they informed me they would and did inform the appropriate department as if that helped me at the time. Three weeks later no response. A refund would not even compensate for the relative discomfort. Had that seat not been available I would have taken the day flight on the un-refurbished plane they left us with for a year until they introduce a new plane.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,4,no
Singapore Airlines customer review,5,Margaret Lai,20th August 2014,Flew from Osaka to SIN. No bottled water provided. Requested the Japanese breakfast and the meal came without the fish. Anyway shared the fish with my daughter who ordered the same meal and it was very salty. Requested warm water twice and the crew earnestly promised but never delivered. Upon landing while the aircraft was still cruising we could hear the crew arguing loudly among themselves as we occupied the last few row of seats - very unprofessional.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,,4,no
Singapore Airlines customer review,3,P Gennai,20th August 2014,Hong Kong to Singapore. I have travelled on Singapore Airlines B777-200 on the last segment of my trip. The aircraft was old the inflight entertainment system is poor and the seat is also old. I was quite surprised to see that Singapore Airlines is still flying with this old thing. Food was just acceptable but nothing special. The meal service (dinner) was very late. This keeps you awake for most of the flight waiting for the dinner and just fall to sleep a few minutes before arrival.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,,1,no
Singapore Airlines customer review,10,Karamdeep Singh Satwant Singh,14th August 2014,Sydney to Singapore on A380 SQ232 and Singapore to KL on SQ118. The SQ232 flight was outstanding. Very efficient crew with turnaround time for bell call being less than a minute. It was a rather smooth ride food excellent and good entertainment selection. SQ118 was a short flight of 45 minutes but again crew was excellent and proved why its still one of the best.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,8,Tercon Bojan,14th August 2014,The service on this short (less than 2 hour) flight and the delicious meal is what made the SQ flight experience outstanding. For the old 777-200 with the very old business class is certainly nothing to brag about.,,,Business Class,,,2.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,8,Brian Smith,11th August 2014,Flew outward BCN-SIN via Milan as part of a MAD-KUL journey. For reasons we still can't understand at check-in in at MAD Air Europa checked our bags through to SIN only and couldn't issue boarding passes beyond BCN. We had to check in again at BCN which proved a blessing in disguise as SIA impressed us by unprompted noting that our bags weren't checked through to KL and organising that for us. Flight was on time and reasonably comfortable (on 777) crew handled some noisy adjacent passengers well by taking time to circle the cabin rather than going to them directly with our complaint. Food was OK; although obviously partly serviced from Milan with some uninspiring Italian products. Drinks came with good frequency although self-service option overnight especially for water might be better. Back SIN-LHR on A380. Again check-in staff did well readily changing our seat allocation to what we preferred. Flight delayed mostly by re-routing 75 minutes causing some stress over connections in London - no information offered on those at all. Service OK with choice of three meals (against only two outbound). Breakfast could do with better bakery selection but hot choices both OK. Strange that despite the one hour delay it was offered a good 2.5 hours before arrival (ie 3.30 in the morning London time) and in a vary patchy fashion with different parts of the cabin served seemingly at random. IFE worked OK on both flights lots of channels although not everything on them appears on the menus which is confusing. Wifi offered on A380 but pay as you go so no experience of that. In all entirely satisfactory product but not outstanding or memorable although customer care at check-in was well beyond usual experience.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,7,M Cochrane,11th August 2014,"Gold Frequent Flyer with Singapore Airlines for last seven years. Regularly upgrade to business class. Singapore's new planes are for the most part very good. There is however an increasing indifference to FF status in economy. The last three economy trips Singapore sales staff on allocating seating have assured me that ""no aisle seats further forward are available"". When checking online however there have been several - it's just that the aisle seats have been beside other vacant seats.",,,Economy Class,,,4.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,10,Roberto Ligot,8th August 2014,RUH-SIN-MNL-SIN-RUH in economy. One thing I can say about this airline - excellent landings. I will miss this airline when it removes the Riyadh route in September or October 2014. Clean inflight food and entertainment is excellent.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,10,Charanjit Malli,3rd August 2014,Flew from Perth to London and back great service flight and plenty of food. Travelled by the A380 777 A330 with ample leg room for someone tall. Food was very good for a vegetarian. Best long haul flight.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,9,Alan Tang,3rd August 2014,SQ 323 AMS-SIN with B777-200ER I had been aware that this is a retrofitted aircraft but surprisingly the aircraft was very well maintained. The seats are very comfortable in economy class the legroom is pretty spacious for me. The lunch service with three options which I have not personally had before and both quantity and quality of meals are at the top level of service. The most important thing about the sector should be the cabin crew they were very attentive. Overall I have been very pleased with the quality given by Singapore Airlines and recommend the airline for long haul flights.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,10,Nagarkar Ameya,3rd August 2014,SQ246 July 7th BNE-SIN. SQ422 8th July BNE-BOM. SQ421 17th July BOM-SIN. SQ255 18th July SIN-BNE. I have been flying with SQ for the last 5 years. They have excellent service staff and crew members and a great on-time performance record! Some aircraft's are a bit old (example: Boeing 777-200ER that flies between SYD and BOM). The screen resolution and quality is quite poor on this aircraft but the crew members are friendly and great to talk to if you don't want to watch movies/TV.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,8,S Paice,29th July 2014,LHR-SIN-LHR. Outbound leg on the older 777 but the seat was comfortable enough. IFE was also the older system but worked well and the headphones were excellent (after a broken pair was replaced). Crew generally good and attentive although some far better than others and the service was a bit abrupt at times with items being almost snatched away. Inbound flight left SIN at 1.30am dinner served about an hour into the flight then lights out. Used the 'book the cook' service outbound monkfish as excellent return curry a bit hotter than I was expecting but good quality.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,4,Alan Tan,27th July 2014,July 2014 SIN-MNL-SIN. Seats were OK for both sectors. Leg space for A330 was narrow but MNL-SIN B777-200 retrofitted seats have more space. However B777-200 'new' PTV shrunk and low resolutions. Both sector's in flight meals were disappointing. SQ's meals standard have dropped in the past one year. They should ask their own chef to try out first before sending to cabin.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,,3,no
Singapore Airlines customer review,5,Smith Dean,27th July 2014,Flew business class from SIN-MEL overnight on a 777. Very disappointed in the shabby scuffed and old cabin. The seats were narrow (compared to 777-300ER and A380) and did not lie fully flat (this should be standard for a premium airline). I had some emails to send and found that there was no wifi available (again this is offered on their 777-300ER and A380). I wouldn't mind if there was a discount for this plane model but for Singapore Airlines high prices passengers deserve better.,,,Business Class,,,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,1,no
Singapore Airlines customer review,3,E Tan,20th July 2014,9 July Auckland - Singapore. Seats not comfortable; leg space just about adequate. PTVs small and old. Cabin too warm. In flight meals disappointing. Service was reasonable but could have been better. Disappointing flight all round. Not looking forward to journey home.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,,3,no
Singapore Airlines customer review,3,T Kam,20th July 2014,Flew SYD-SIN-LHR then reverse. Originally was meant to be A380-B747 outbound then A380 for both legs inbound. This was changed to B777-300 and B747 out and B777-300 in. The B777 was exceedingly cramped with very little leg room. When reclining the seat moves forward further reducing your already limited legroom and when the passenger in front reclines the seat back comes very close to you. Sardines in a can spring to mind. On the return trip because of the change of 'plane outbound I checked on-line and discovered the change so for the second leg SIN- SYD I managed to change my seats to next to emergency door definitely worth paying the extra. As for the seats themselves on the B777 the seats are very hard with not much in the way of cushioning making a bad situation worse. From LHr-SIN the in-flight entertainment was a modern touchscreen unit with an extensive choice but was extremely sensitive and with the closeness of it next to your knees the slightest choice would activate it illuminating your area and your fellow passengers with light not good if wanting to sleep that is if you can sleep in the crowded conditions. From SIN-SYD the unit was an old system with very limited choice and I soon gave up with it. Having flown SIA many times before I was really looking forward to flying with them to experience the (relative) comfort of the A380 yet again. What a disappointment! Previously whenever asked I would say that SIA was my favourite airline but these cost-cutting measures have made me re-evaluate that.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,,3,no
Singapore Airlines customer review,7,H Watson,17th July 2014,Travelled SYD-SIN-ZRH. SYD-SIN on the old (and very full) 777-200. The entertainment system on this leg is awful barely any good movies to watch very limited. Food was fine. Arrived in Singapore early gate to connecting flight just next door too good to be true. They say if it's too good to be true it probably is - the flight to Zurich was delayed 4 hours due to a hydraulic problem with the plane (oil leaking throughout the wing). Although this was extremely frustrating the staff were extremely helpful assisting people who were going to miss their next connecting flights etc. When we finally got on the flight to Zurich (an A380) the staff were great. Food pretty good and entertainment much better. Singapore Airlines always provide excellent service and Changi airport is very easy to navigate.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,9,Lau Ni,17th July 2014,Redeemed an award flight for the family on NGO-SIN leg on 8 July 2014. Fantastic service as expected of SQ Business Class. IFS switched effortlessly to dialect and Mandarin when speaking to my parents who do not speak English. The crew were professional attentive and friendly. Seats were excellent better than the Asiana Business Class which I took 3 weeks prior. The noise-cancelling headsets given gave me painful ears after a while though. This was the first time I used their headsets as I used to carry my own - room for improvement on that. While everything else worked perfectly the privacy screen was stuck and took a strapping male FA some effort to take out. Food was very good except for dessert where the Chocolate Truffle Cake for dessert was disappointingly dry and hard. We enjoyed both the Japanese and the Western options. Food was served upon being airborne which was about 11am so it was rather early for lunch. When we asked for some fruits for snacks (or anything really) at around 3pm the FA said they did not have any food left and offered us mixed nuts instead. Perhaps SQ should stock up on snack items?,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,9,Siauw Steve,17th July 2014,HND-SIN-CGK on A330-300 and B777-200 (retrofitted) respectively. First leg Tokyo-HND to Singapore-SIN morning flight. Very generous volume and options of food and drinks. I always like the Singapore Sling cocktail by the way. Second leg retrofitted B777-200 from Singapore to Jakarta. Tasty fruit platter and excellent hot towel service as always.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,7,N Hodgson,17th July 2014,AKL-SIN-LHR-SIN-MEL in Economy using points redemption. Comfortable enough flight on all legs legroom good in economy and service typically robotic and boring. IFE excellent. No issue with inflight as they are definitely good. No recognition whatsoever for status despite my partner spending significant sums with this airline but no surprises there as this is the usual procedure with Singapore Airlines these days. Lounge in Singapore not good. On a long haul flight such as this there are no showering amenities. I realise for Business and First travellers this is available in SilverKris lounge but in KrisFlyer Gold not. The lounge is very basic and as their hub being Changi I had expected more. Food options were lacklustre and overall quite disappointing. The flight itself however couldn't fault and arrived feeling fairly refreshed at either end but their lounges at all destinations where SQ operated are always fairly average. LHR SIN MEL all initially come to mind.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,,3,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,7,Lau Ni,17th July 2014,Took an Airbus 330 SIN-KIX on 29 June 2014. Flight departed and arrived on time. Service was average - good but not excellent. Perhaps it has to do with the full load. Aircraft was alternating between very cold and very hot throughout the flight. Restrooms were clean IFE working perfectly and food was standard. The major flaw was the seat pitch. Couldn't remember the last time I took SQ's A330 but the seat pitch was way smaller than even ANA Domestic which I took twice during this trip. It was very cramped.,,,Premium Economy,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,7,J Wong,13th July 2014,SQ285 from SIN to AKL. Despite a full flight service was good. Flight steward were attended to fulfil my request very soon after the bell was pressed. But disappointed over the ageing aircraft. SQ ticket price definitely not in the lower bracket but the 777-300 cabinet condition and facilities were just too old when comparing to other carriers.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,,2,no

Singapore Airlines customer review,9,S Stephen,13th July 2014,I flew from Zurich to Jakarta via Singapore all flights were on time and friendly attentive cabin crew they really give attention to passengers. Seat was very comfortable and the entertainment was great enough for a 12 hour flight but the flight path was not as informative as before. First flight from Zurich to Singapore had horrible seafood menu as I ordered before and the fourth flight from Singapore to Zurich the problem was the entertainment system - we couldn't see the flight path and the audio or video was stuck every few minutes. I did try the Wi-Fi onboard. I think $5.99 for 5 MB was far too expensive and the connection was slow. Other than that every aspect was went very well (check in boarding transit baggage handling).,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,8,Ala Lim,8th July 2014,LAX - Singapore via Tokyo. Entertainment system in the new Airbus A380 was excellent had all new movies. Service was good they had hot towels and many choices of food. The headphones weren't working well I could only hear from one side. Seats were pretty small for a new aircraft but overall satisfying.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,9,Peter Fitzgerald,6th July 2014,Flew SIA business class Christchurch - Singapore - Istanbul and then London - Singapore - Auckland. Staff service was superb.

Singapore Airlines customer review,8,A Makiol,6th July 2014,Flew BNE-SIN return in Economy class. All flights departed and arrived on time. Aircraft was modern and clean A330 with nice interior. Seats were not the most comfortable and felt a bit cramped. IFE was very good user friendly. The cabin crew are wonderful very helpful kind and courteous. Food was of high quality however the continental breakfast was a let down. All kinds of amenities were available and snacks provided on request. I did enjoy my trip with Singapore Airlines maybe a tad overrated. I feel other Asian airlines such as KE CX CI are just as good but still one of the best airlines you can fly!,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,5,yes

Singapore Airlines customer review,6,J Murray,3rd July 2014,"Rome to Singapore SQ 365 on 27 June. We were advised at check-in that there had been a change of aircraft and our hearts sank when we boarded it was an ancient 777 surprised that Singapore Airlines still uses these dinosaurs. I have never experienced such old uncomfortable business class seats (you could select either seat recline or leg raise not both at the same time). I am only 5 ft 4"" and I felt scrunched up. There was no storage around the seat area for personal belongings on this very old plane really not good enough for a five star airline on a long haul route. No mattress over the seats as you get with Qantas and no amenities pack (only slippers and eye shade). The only saving grace were the crew they were exemplary fantastic in fact and the meals were fantastic. If only the aircraft matched the wonderful service on board.",,,Business Class,,,1.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,,3,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,2,H Davis,3rd July 2014,Dubai-Singapore-Perth. Very disappointing. What has happened to Singapore Airlines? The standard of the aircraft was just not up to today's standards and that's not because I usually fly Emirates which is in another class altogether compared to this flight at the same price! The whole interior of the aircraft was that of the 1980's. The seats were old and didn't function properly entertainment screen was tiny dim (even on full brightness) and blurry. I flew economy but felt sorrier for business class where seats looked like they were out of the 1970’s. Yes there are some other airlines that are as bad but you pay for what you get and this flight was not cheap. Note: even low cost airlins these days have new fresh interiors albeit basic.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,,1,no
Singapore Airlines customer review,10,Pathmarueban Naidu,3rd July 2014,SQ919 MNL-SIN 24th June 2014. From check-in to deboarding the plane check-in personnel were good.

Singapore Airlines customer review,4,Alan Ford,1st July 2014,Singapore to Auckland SQ281 777-200. Can't believe Singapore still use this aircraft it desperately needs an overhaul tiny 6 inch displays no touch even with full brightness I was struggling switched to using my tablet instead. Seat rests do go fully up. Service was poor this time around Food normally in economy is ok to good this wasn't.

Singapore Airlines customer review,9,Peter Britain,1st July 2014,MEL-JFK over three separate legs. Encountered crews ranging from good to excellent on these flights. Catering was mainly Book the Cook and very good (FRA food is never as good as most other ports). Choice of DOM or Krug and great wine selection. SQ are still close to perfect in first class.,,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,1,Mumford Patricia,25th June 2014,The plane seemed to be extremely old and in need of upgrade. Flight SQ0324 Friday 6th June. In the past I have always praised Singapore Airlines for having more room in Economy than any other airline - I was evidently very wrong and I guess lucky in the past. I had bruises on my leg where I had squeezed out of my seat to go to the bathroom - the passenger in front had reclined his seat and I couldn't get out of my seat easily. Flight was so bad I cancelled my flight home with Singapore (and lost the money) rather than suffer that trip again I flew back to Melbourne with Qatar.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,1,no

Return flight 14th June as above but Singapore to London to our disappointment the aircraft was changed to a Boeing 777 300er series much prefer the A380. Cannot fault the service staff very polite did their job well - we were given plenty of drinks during the flight. Seating and legroom good with good choice of entertainment.

Singapore Airlines customer review,10,Chew Daniel,20th June 2014,7th June SIN-BKK 10th June BKK-SIN. Both were on A330s with on time arrivals. Something seems different with SQ now; The cabin crew now exude character and warmth. They're quick to start a quick conversation with you and go the extra mile to make sure that your flight is comfortable. Definitely heading back to being one of the best airlines in the world.

Singapore Airlines customer review,5,Gonzales Pedro,20th June 2014,I normally take China Airlines for my monthly flight from Surabaya to Singapore. I found that the departure time is nice but the return time is far too early in the morning so my travel agent advised me to use SIA sister company Silk Air for the return. Expecting something special as I'm paying more money I didn't find anything special except the extra amenities. The so called Singapore Ladies/stewardess that are heavily advertised are nothing special. Please prepare to be disappointed.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3,no
Singapore Airlines customer review,4,John Marles,16th June 2014,Flight SQ 308 9th June 2014. The worst business Class seat too wide no support hard as a rock. You can't sit comfortably in any position and it is pathetic to lie on. My back actually aching on arrival. Never again. Food lousy choice too small service without a smile and even then only when you asked. No pyjamas SIN to London and one meal served with no cloth at all. Used to be great.

ICN-SIN did not see flight attendants for a full hour after take off no offer of any drinks before take off or after. Poor selection of lunch offered - Braised beef with lentils! Staff hid behind curtain no offer of refills during a 5 hour flight. SIN-BNE - FA's were rude midnight flight there was no offer of any snacks during 8 hour flight and made to feel I was an inconvenience when asking for a drink. Breakfast meal (received 6 hours into flight) was rubbish. Have flown Economy with Singapore and it was fine. I thought flying Business Class was going to be an amazing experience -it was just terrible. Rude staff and poor service. Will never fly with them again as it was such a waste (of a lot) of money!,,,Business Class,,,4.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,,1,no

Singapore Airlines customer review,7,A Genner,8th June 2014,We flew from LHR - Singapore - Brisbane - Cairns then the same return journey. In general the service was good and we all enjoyed the food very much. There was a problem on the route from Singapore to Brisbane in that our seats were in the centre block and for some reason the crew kept missing us first we got no food (they ran out just as they got to us then started serving people around us but not us) and in spite of several attempts to get their attention they ignored us. Eventually my husband had to go down and ask them for food. The stewardess was very apologetic. I also noticed that when seatbelt checks were done on that flight they didn't actually look along our row. I witnessed a couple of people pressing the Call button and getting no response at least for quite a while. On the same flight the entertainment monitors were unreliable. Mine didn't have sound for a while and my son's just stopped working. The other legs of our journey were quite good and I was impressed that our luggage reached our final destination efficiently. I did find the legroom a bit cramped but that was more to do with the pillows and blankets. The main problem on the final leg of our return journey was a child a couple of rows behind us that just cried incessantly for almost 16 hours. Being a night flight we'd hoped to sleep most of the way but the whole section of the plane around the child was kept awake. There seemed to be no bassinets on our flight so no doubt the child had to try to get comfortable sitting on parents lap? The crew were no doubt also affected by the crying but what can anyone do in such a situation?,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,9,C Lin,29th May 2014,I flew SIA (B777-300ER) from Houston to Singapore (return) it was great. However for the first trip I ordered the seafood meal. It was very disappointing. One of the seafood meals (breakfast) was just eggs and a little bacon (it looked like a low calorie meal). On my return trip I opted for regular meals all were satisfactory. I will never order seafood meals from SIA.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,9,Joel Ong,29th May 2014,Flew on SQ856 SIN-HKG 388 and SQ871 HKG-SIN 772. The A380 was excellent as it's a brand new aircraft with new comfy seats and more legroom. Also the crew provides excellent service for my family. Food was pretty decent but the IFE could be improved. The return leg was an old 777-200ER. The service is as usual the SIA high standards and the interior and seats are well- maintained and not worn out despite being an old aircraft. In overall the entire experience with Singapore Airlines journey was splendid and worth the money will definitely fly the carrier again.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,2,Chiew Robin,29th May 2014,Singapore Airlines in its heydays was the service and efficiency pacesetter amongst international airlines. Unfortunately it has lost much of its shine and has reduced itself to relying on price advantage to survive the onslaught by more progressive truly international airlines which are more in tune with today's international travellers. Case in point: during my last 2 trips from Melbourne to Singapore and back on First and Business Class 1) Cabin crews lack communication and English language skills most are not able to carry a decent mature conversation. 2) Male crews lack discipline and female crews rushing around like pre-programmed robots without genuine warmth. 3) Filthy leather seats and the lack of general cleanliness show up an ageing tired airline. 4) Second rate food even in First with badly stocked kitchens without essentials such as Soy milk for coffee and fresh chilli sauce for food. And the list goes on. Wake up Singapore the world has moved on.,,,First Class,,,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,,2,no
Singapore Airlines customer review,8,M Mejia,25th May 2014,MNL-SIN return with 3 kids. Fantastic airline despite using old equipment (777-200) for the regional route. Kids meals very tasty that even my daughter who is a very picky eater had no problems finishing the generous portions. Specialised headsets for the kids as well as some activity materials too. IFE acceptable and adequate to keep the young ones entertained for the 3 hour flight. Well worth the money.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,9,Andrew Rumpel,24th May 2014,SYD-MNL-SYD. Our first sector from Sydney to Singapore was good seat comfort was good food was good for economy IFE was average since it wasn't the SIA KrisWorld flagship system. Singapore to Manila was good flight A330 full flight. Security and boarding was slow (typical for Manila bound flights however) however it was SIA's Economy product seen on the A380. Returning back to Sydney the Singapore to Manila leg was on a older B777 aircraft with an old IFE system with loop programming food was good and seat comfort was good. Our final leg to Sydney was on an A380 on the upper deck. The flight wasn't full and the cabin crew during pushback invited us to come downstairs and check out an empty row so we got a row to ourselves and it was a very comfortable trip back to Sydney. IFE was good food was good however a bit disappointed with the continental breakfast which was essentially a fruit and muffin. Service overall was excellent same high standard that Singapore Airlines provides and the flights ran on time some flights arriving earlier than scheduled. Price was great and would definitely recommend SIA to anyone travelling.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,7,Oscar Nyholm,23rd May 2014,MEL-SIN - 777-300ER. The flight was ok but the service was amazing! The food was good the seat was good. It was a red-eye flight that was 7hrs and only 1:30hrs of sleep - it took 2:30hrs for dinner and 2hrs for breakfast. I would recommend that Singapore Airlines should do short meal services for red-eye flights.,,,Business Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,9,Philip Peace,16th May 2014,London to Sydney LHR/SIN on the 777-300ER with new business class and SIN/SYD on the A380-800 with the older business product. The food and service was superb. I used book the cook for both legs lamb chops on the second leg were memorable. Champagne was Bollinger. The new business seats are excellent but suffer from the requirement to place ones feet in a small pocket to sleep diagonally. If you can get the bulkhead seats do so as this avoids the problem. I got bulkhead seats for the second leg on the A380. SIA do not offer sleeping suits in business.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,4,A Moffatt,16th May 2014,"I was very disappointed by the Singapore Airlines business class travel experienced recently. My partner and I flew from Australia to Europe and back with Singapore Airlines three sectors on the A380 and one on a B777. Surprisingly the B777 provided the more comfortable experience despite the lack of a fully flat bed. The seats on the A380 are extremely wide (which was the initial draw card and the reason for spending $1500 more than for Cathay Pacific) but you have to sit in them diagonally to reach the foot rest - this was comfortable for about 5 minutes. The beds in the fully flat position are quite comfortable but unlike other business class seats there is no smooth transition from sitting to lying - you are required to 'make' the bed. When in the bed position there is no comfortable backrest to allow you to sit comfortably - hence the large number of business travellers seen sitting cross-legged in bed throughout the flight! Furthermore the seats are leather but are very worn sometimes damaged and the headrests do not stay in position. There are no individual amenities kits (just an eye mask and some slippers) - a selection of items are available in the toilet cubicles. There are no pyjamas as on some other airlines. The service was highly variable. The worst sector by far was from Singapore to Heathrow. The staff were anything but attentive the bathrooms were unclean and food was dreadful. Garlic bread was cold and rock hard and the ""Book the Cook"" proved to be extremely disappointing. The lobster thermidore was a complete let-down and looked nothing like the pictures posted online by the airline and other travellers. The nut-encrusted veal was unfortunately the toughest and coldest piece of meal I have had on a flight and the ""crust"" was more like a soggy coating. That said the meals that were not pre-ordered were generally of very high quality. The entertainment system was excellent. Having previous travelled in Business Class with Qantas and Cathay Pacific I would not hesitate to return to these two in preference to Singapore Airlines in future.",,,Business Class,,,2.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,,2,no
Singapore Airlines customer review,9,Terry Teo,16th May 2014,KUL-Singapore-Dubai and return. The seat were spacious with good storage spaces but a bit dated due wear and tear. Crews were attentive food served was generous and the entertainment selection was good.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,10,Teng Joon Seng,11th May 2014,Excellent carrier everything is excellent. Steward/Stewardess are very polite and when I entered the aircraft I had a sense that everything is going to be excellent. Meals are excellent and captain announcements were very clear and aircraft cabin was new and modern.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,8,C Jones,11th May 2014,Quick business trip involving 4 long haul sectors on SQ. AKL-SIN-AMS-CPH-SIN-AKL. First two on 777-300ER and return on 777-200ER. As always fabulous and consistent service and quality all round. SQ is refitting their 777-200ER fleet with decent Business class seats similar to those fitted to the 300's and A380's but they still have 4 or 5 aircraft's not yet done. Unfortunately I got one sector with one of these and they are bad after you've experienced their newer product. If you are unlucky enough to get one of these you probably won't know until you board see the seats and get that sinking feeling! Looking forward to them finishing the job as they appear to be using the old ones to NZ a lot!,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,1,Julia Lim,11th May 2014,Service standards are disappointing. My flight was on SQ 298 from Christchurch to Singapore in general for the price of the ticket I expected much better. Food was very poor. For someone with high tolerance in salty food the Chinese dinner meal (rice with pork in gravy) was very salty. Lamb stew served for lunch was undercooked. Choice of meals ran out for both lunch and dinner and entertainment systems were surprisingly outdated (compared to other airlines with touch screen and consoles SIA only had old fashioned consoles). Air stewardesses were decent but not the most helpful or courteous. Having flown SIA and other airlines like Emirates and even budget carriers in recent years I find that the standard of SIA has been poorly maintained and sad to say even though I am a Singaporean who would want to support the main airline of our small country the substandard flight service and appalling customer service I experienced this flight definitely does not live up to the price of its reputation and premium airline tickets. I would not be flying Singapore Airlines again.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,1,no
Singapore Airlines customer review,8,James Wall,10th May 2014,Flew LHR to MNL - to give some context I've done pretty much every route to Manila in recent years usually based on price at the time. I found Singapore Airlines still to be a cut above the rest - but not perfect - and wouldn't hesitate to use again. Main leg on way out was on a modern 777 very nice and clearly more space than competition due to 3-3-3 layout - food all good and I can't remember any other carrier proactively offering so many drinks and refills in Economy. However the Singapore to Manila leg (and same coming back) was a much older 777 cabin with mediocre screens etc. Still no complaints as the equivalent leg on Malaysian (comparable due to distance) is on a real shocker of a 737. On way back my video screen was down for the whole flight and the staff asked me to stay behind to speak to the customer service team at Changi for 'compensation' - they gave me some kind of wallet which was a nice touch but not worth waiting behind on an empty plane for. Singapore to London on A380 upstairs - great flight and great space. All 4 flights were delayed which was frustrating but hey not the airlines' fault. Generally - the long haul legs very impressive the shorter flights average but overall far better than any other route to the Philippines. One frustration is security rules at the gate at Changi - confiscating water bought 2 minutes before at the airport which seems excessive.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,9,Charles Kennedy,8th May 2014,LHR-SIN. Check-in agent was extremely helpful - even though I was travelling on a reward ticket issued by TACA and booked through Avianca (a tortuous provenance one would expect to preclude changes) I asked at check-in if I could take the later 2230 flight instead of the 2100 I was booked on so I could get more work done in the lounge before the flight (and also as I prefer A380 to 777-300ER). Not only did he manage to do this but having done so he realised my bag had already been tagged and sent down the chute so printed a new tag gave me my travel documents then raced off to intercept my bag and re-tag it somewhere in the bowels of T3. Amazing effort (and obviously successful as my bag indeed made it on the right flight). SAS lounge pretty good nice view of the airfield action. Onboard SQ were using the hi-J config A380 with business class taking up the entire upper deck. My window seat was the last row and on it’s own between the rear exit just ahead and the galley just behind. Service was very nice as usual from SQ and again dispelled the myth that they are smiling robots as I had several nice conversations with different members of the crew. Food was a bit of a letdown (seafood and rice dish very bland) but the bed is so good it’s almost too comfortable - I slept so well that I had awful jetlag for a week arriving at 6pm incredibly refreshed left me hideously out of synch with the local time zone. I will manage my sleep patterns better and ask for some spicy sauce on the side of my main next time but SQ remain one of the best in the air.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,9,B Le Quesne,8th May 2014,In the last 2 weeks I flew from Perth to Singapore to Johannesburg back to Singapore then to Hong Kong from Hong Kong back to Singapore and finally home to Perth! All with Singapore Airlines. Every flight was quite simply the best I have experienced. I actually found myself looking forward to a meal on a plane. All aspects were fast efficient friendly and professional. Economy seats on the 777 are far better than any other airline I have flown IFE was very good with a wide selection all flights on time and onboard staff very good. Quite simply I can see why they are always rated so highly.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,7,R Montgomery,7th May 2014,We have been Silver Krisflyer members for 15 years at least and just flew Johannesburg to Singapore SQ479 26 Apr and Singapore to Brisbane SQ235 27 Apr and the disinterested and offhand manner of the staff was very noticeable. The females with one exception were unsmiling and almost snatched trays from us. During meal service flight attendants in the past always ensured the comfort of passenger dining by requesting the seats be upright but on these two flights I had to ask that this be done. Also there was a huge rush to get a stone cold awful breakfast served before landing in Brisbane - why? Then they missed the fact that a passenger in front still had his seat reclined for landing. We noticed similar problems on a return Europe flight last year.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,,4,yes

Singapore Airlines customer review,10,O Kelvin,5th May 2014,Singapore Changi to Guangzhou Baiyun return. Stewardess were attentive and polite. Hot towel upon arrival. Food was excellent. Seats were comfortable. Good serving time and the drinks were great. Power sockets were found on the seats great for my laptop!

I had the pleasure of flying for the first time not only to New Zealand from Heathrow but with Singapore Airlines. I just had to write to say how excellent my flying time was. I was made to feel safe secure welcome and as if I was the only passenger on the plane. Nothing was too much trouble. The staff were immaculate in all areas of appearance. A great flight.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,8,Koh Chwee Lee,30th April 2014,Singapore to San Francisco on 26 April 2014 which was a full flight. Before take off it seemed that some passengers were not assigned seats but the ground and cabin crew were on top of sorting things out. Food from Singapore to Hong Kong was pretty good but the food from Hong Kong to San Francisco was quite disappointing.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,,3,yes

My wife and I have flown Singapore Airlines before and have always been more than satisfied with every aspect of the flight. This trip was even better than in the past. The crew on both flights were exceptionally helpful since my wife had hip surgery recently and needed extra attention. We were accommodated at every turn during the flight. The American carriers could learn a lot from Singapore Airlines.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes

Beijing - Singapore however SQ 223 25 April 2014 Singapore - Perth what a shambles full flight cabin staff were more interested in 'special meals etc'. Eventually after a 1.5 hour delay we were served lunch you read about staff not answering call button this happened to us eventually our call was answered there was definitely a problem. No coffee and tea was brought around eventually my husband took our meal trays down to the back galley only to be met with oh! We forgot!

Singapore Airlines customer review,10,Raoul Dasilva,27th April 2014,Travelled Denpasar (Bali) to Singapore on SQ 943. This was a great flight. Gracious and charming service on a 7 year old 777-200 in the old configuration with comfy armchair style recliners. Delicious beef steak with great red wine and champagne. The cabin crew were professional and friendly. The IFE was very old fashioned but that was the only demerit otherwise excellent.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,5,yes

Singapore Airlines customer review,9,Chan Anthony Dominic,27th April 2014,"I am a Kris Flyer ""Silver Elite"" member and I have recently travelled the Suites from Hong Kong to Singapore. I enjoyed every moment of the flight. A nice glass of bubbles (Dom Perignon) was offered before take off. The cabin crews were very attentive and helpful on every aspect of my flight. The food was more than adequate for me. A nice touch when a head cabin service officer apologized to me about the delay when the flight took off behind schedule from HKG was due to late arrival to HKG from Singapore. I'll recommend this airline.",,,First Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,10,B Smith,27th April 2014,I have been on many business class trips all lovely but Singapore Airlines tops them all. Their cabin crew are friendly and always smiling the meals were excellent the seat was huge and IFE was excellent. The lounge in Singapore was the best I have been in. For the 25 hours it took to get from Sydney to Paris I enjoyed every second what I liked the most was the express passes at Sydney International Airport skipping the queue at customs. I don't usually fly on business trips with the kids but they loved it too!,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,9,M Obermann,27th April 2014,Flew with family ICN-SIN-DPS and back. Food was very tasty (for economy standard). Entertainment selection is very extensive.

Singapore Airlines customer review,2,J Stephenson,23rd April 2014,Singapore to London Heathrow on 17th April 2014 at 11.30pm. The best seats on any airline would be in a child free cabin having just returned on another flight having to endure 13 hours listening to a screaming child I think all airlines should ensure children/infants are in a separate cabin.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,2,no
Singapore Airlines customer review,10,U Ashwathy,23rd April 2014,I am a fairly new traveller with Singapore with 7 trips in 2014 usually from Singapore to and from my homeland India or my office in Germany. Today returned from my short Easter vacation with a round trip Pune-Mumbai- Singapore in Business class on 421 and 422. Spacious seats with extendable leg space for sleeping. Excellent Service - offered blankets and head rest within minutes. They serve the best inflight fresh food. You must not miss their 'Book the Cook' option and their speciality is the delicious Lobster Thermidor. Staff pronounced my difficult name correctly and the stewardess offered to fill in my landing visa form my luggage was already towed in advance to my waiting car so I wont have to wait at the terminal after my flight.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes

Singapore Airlines customer review,10,T Kimberley,19th April 2014,Flight 305 1/3/14. I have flown with them before but quite few years ago so assumed they would of gone downhill like so many airlines but what a pleasant surprise nothing had changed! Great service from the cabin crew comfortable seating really nice food and best of all a brilliant IFE system. I have flown with Cathay Pacific and Malaysian a lot and they are good but no where near the same class as Singapore.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,9,J Choi,16th April 2014,This is my second time travelling with SQ. This time it was HKG-LHR with a transit in Singapore (SQ856 and SQ306). The trip was excellent in all respects especially the catering and the seat which has footrests unlike CX (which I found to be much needed on 13 hour flights). However the transit in Changi was confusing as it is against convention in the way that arrivals and departures are in the same area and I was trying to find somewhere to go through immigration again which turns out to be at the gate itself. Also the A380's on both trips had a good variety in their IFE despite not being touch screen because the remote controller was not always responsive. I loved the rear economy section on the upper deck of the A380 it was cosy and small meaning less noise and less people knocking against you when you are trying to go to the galley or bathroom. The purser was great trying desperately to look for the other meal option from the downstairs cabin after it ran out on the upper deck. In a nutshell a well deserved 5 star airline and something that is a class above Emirates.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,8,C Chun,15th April 2014,Just completed a return trip BKK-IST in biz class on 777-200 retro fitted. What a great way to fly! Service was excellent got addressed by name on all 4 sectors and food was generally high standard overall. We tried the 'Book the Cook' Service and ordered their famous Lobster Thermidor. It was very good. The waffles unfortunately were terrible. The seat itself is very wide and not too bad for sleeping if you sleep diagonally. It was my first time in the seats and I didn't realise that the seat back didn't go back flat the full width of the seat. Perhaps the only disappointing thing would be the KrisWorld Entertainment System - it wasn't as extensive in selection of movies as say Cathay Pacific. The lounges were very good especially the Turkish Airlines one in Istanbul - incredible!!! This was a FF Points trip -if only we could afford to fly like this all the time.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,10,V Cardinale,13th April 2014,I travelled using Singapore Airlines on the weekend returning from Phuket and I must say I am nothing but impressed. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly the plane itself was comfortable having ample room to stretch out (with two children that can be a bit hard). The flight was smooth and comfortable. I would highly recommend using them I have used them previously and have always been happy with their service.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,10,L Darius,11th April 2014,Flew from Melbourne to Singapore on a Boeing 777-300ER. Entertainment options available were aplenty.

Singapore Airlines customer review,9,S Hanvey,10th April 2014,Manchester UK - Munich - Singapore - Brisbane and same for return. Very friendly crew very welcoming and helpful. Hot towels before take off nice food and a good range of snacks available at any time. Good range of TV programmes and films that keep you entertained. Blankets socks and headphones provided on each flight. Seats not particularly big with only slightly more leg room than a short haul flight but still fairly comfortable. Always on time with no problems/delays. Overall a great airline with a great service! Would definitely recommend.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,10,K Piddick,7th April 2014,SYD-SIN-BKK return. SQ232 and 231 on A380 and SIN/BKK sectors on A330. Having flown with the rest I have now again flown with the best. Return flight SIN to SYD not full - was seated upstairs and upon request was granted exit row seats without fuss. Everything about these flights was near perfect and yet the fares paid were no different from the other airlines. Most pleasant relaxing flights with nothing more needing reporting. Definitely a cut above the rest.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,10,H Thordarson,6th April 2014,BKK-SIN 25th March. After having to endure a flight from Copenhagen to Bangkok with SAS Scandinavian Airlines the Singapore flight was like ascending from hell to heaven. The contrast could not have been greater. Wonderful service great food and excellent entertainment. Singapore Airlines really care about their customers and it shows. Definitely worth every penny and highly recommended.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,no
Singapore Airlines customer review,8,H Thordarson,6th April 2014,SIN-AKL 28th March. Very nice smooth flight. A printed menu good food a great entertainment system. The 777 is not the most spacious aircraft but never mind at least Singapore Airlines have the brains to stick to a 3x3x3 seating arrangement and do not push it to 3x4x3 like some others such as Air New Zealand do. (In my opinion there should be some international law that forbids this practice because the cramped isle compromises safety.) The service and entertainment made up for the lack of space so I would still rate it as a 5 star experience.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,9,Wilson See,2nd April 2014,SIN-DXB-SIN. Both were on the B777-300ER series. Adequate legroom and good IFE to keep me entertained throughout the flight. As usual the service was up to standard professional and efficient but Singapore Airlines service tends to lag the warmth and personable service despite being efficient and professional. That being said a worthwhile flight on both leg under Singapore Airlines and I will recommend to choose Singapore Airline compared to Emirates for this route.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,10,Lopez Roberto,30th March 2014,"The best business class I've experienced. JFK to FRA on an A380.

Singapore Airlines customer review,10,P Tanner,30th March 2014,LHR-SIN-SYD and return. A380 for the first and third legs B777 for the second and fourth. Booked early enough to get the upstairs economy cabin for the A380 flights seats in rows of two with a storage bin on the window side. Only quibble which is trivial is that the library of movies and audio books wasn't that great. Helpful cabin crew rebooted non-functioning IFE very promptly on one leg. Fruit option for meals excellent. Hot towels and regular juice/water supplies much appreciated and the service across the board could not be faulted - the crews seem highly efficient anyway but it helps that there are enough staff for them not to get irritable through needing to work at breakneck pace. We've done this journey with Qantas when they flew Heathrow-Sydney Singapore but switched because a Dubai-Sydney leg is just too long. T3 at Changi is an oasis of calm compared to Dubai and if you book flights with a medium layover you can be asleep in the airside transit hotel minutes after landing. A definite choice of airline and route when we next make the trip.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,8,M Nisa,30th March 2014,SQ942 from Singapore to Denpasar: service was friendly food was good - had no problems with the flight. SQ943 from Denpasar to Singapore: service was cold they had only one meal option left by the time they got to me (thankfully it tasted good). Wondering if SQ has done away with the kids' activity packs because my kids were not given any and I had to ask for the kid-sized headphones for them on both legs.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,10,Hilary Simm,30th March 2014,We recently travelled business class return to Auckland via Singapore. We used both the 777 and airbus 380. What an experience! A lovely huge flat bed an excellent choice of food and wines and amazing service. How they managed to provide such excellent food 32000 feet up was mind boggling! The stewards and stewardesses were so helpful and friendly nothing was too much trouble. They may charge more than some other airlines but they are well worth the money. They will always be my airline of choice!,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,10,Sasun Vartanyan,28th March 2014,Anticipating a good experience on this well reputed airline I was not at all disappointed. Flying A380 on LAX- NRT-SIN route the service was consistently good attentive several menu items and literary numerous (more than 400 movies alone) entertainment options; the only discomfort was the temperature somehow SQ insisted on keeping the cabin quite cold. But overall great service and experience.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,5,R Cartry,28th March 2014,I've been travelling with SA for many years each year a trip from UK to Australia via Singapore some years 2 trips. In addition I've travelled with them from UK to Indonesia via Singapore many times. I think I've been to Singapore around 90 or so times. I've seen terminal 123 all built and improve their great standards. I have huge admiration for Singapore. But in recent years I feel S Airlines has cut and cut its standards. Sadly they seem to be steadily slipping down in standards as they expand. It used to be easy to contact SA and change bookings add trips etc. But now it's a major hassle to get into contact. The food (I travel economy class) is truly awful. It used to be OK. I don't eat a great deal or care a great deal about food but the stuff served up is inedible! I saw many meals barely touched. The cabin staff are pleasant as always but it's definitely harder for them. The planes were pretty much on time (as usual). On my last trip the particular check-in staff at Sydney were great (our bags were mistagged and they sorted it out well) and I think it reflects their character: I'm sure these people are always good. The ground ticketing staff in Singapore were rather incompetent. I wanted a business class side trip to Indonesia. It took about 4 staff to look into it for half an hour and they said none were available. I went economy anyway and found every seat in business class empty. (I look respectable honestly!).,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,,3,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,7,D Fell,26th March 2014,I've just come back from a UK - Perth return trip. I first used them two years ago when I went UK - Auckland return and at that time I could not fault them in anyway this time my experience was different. The food was awful I'm not a person that's fussy about food but every meal was awful. The staff as always were great but you have to ask for everything now that's not standard such as a beer! Don't get me wrong they will get you one but you have to ask before they would ask you. The pillows were dirty god knows with what but you wouldn't put your head on one. I cant put my finger on it but the planes all four were tired. Maybe just a case that they are cutting back the same as everyone else but to me there's no excuse for such poor meals. 3 of us travelled and all of us thought the same.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,,3,no
Singapore Airlines customer review,8,T Chia,19th March 2014,SQ919 MNL-SIN 18/3/2014. Trip was on a refitted B777-200ER registration 9V-SVJ. Actual time inflight was 3hrs 5mins or so. Took off earlier than schedule which was great. Service was good as usual. Crew seem tired since I didn't see any crew change taking place. Drinks service was basic and I still prefer a full drinks cart being pushed out rather than a tray of juices water beer and white wine. Food was great. Had a choice between pork with BBQ flavoured rice and chicken with pasta. I had the pork while my companion had the chicken. My pork dish was excellent with tender pork cubes and vegetables were done right. The rice was a little dry maybe due to overheating. Dessert was bad tasted nothing like mango cream cake. My companion said the chicken tasted good though portions are minuscule. Other than that I asked for 3 cocktails and all of which were honoured. Cabin crew on this leg didn't smile as much understandable due to exhaustion. IFE is a little dated since they used the old IFE but with bigger screens fortunately still AVOD. Seats pretty wide and legroom was standard 32 inches. Aisle seats are bad as they had an IFE box below. The flight was full. I tried asking for souvenirs and was given postcards and playing cards with a smile this time. In conclusion this trip is value for money and good service like always from SQ.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,10,Booth Bev,19th March 2014,Flew Brisbane to Singapore on 14th March sitting in row 57.

Singapore Airlines customer review,9,T Chia,19th March 2014,SQ912 SIN-MNL 13/3/2014. Trip was on a refitted B777-200ER registration 9V-SVG. Actual time inflight was 3hrs 5mins. There was a delay in moving off but captain kept passengers well informed. Service was fantastic as usual better than on the return leg since crew were still fresh from rest. Drinks service was basic and I still prefer a full drinks cart being pushed out rather than a tray of juices water beer and white wine. Food was so-so. Had a choice between braised beef with fried rice and fish with potatoes. I had fish while my companion had the beef. My fish dish was disappointing with not much taste to the fish. Vegetables tasted fine. Starter was a bit on the dry side. Dessert was heavenly. My companion said the beef tasted good. Other than that I asked for 3 cocktails and all of which were honoured with a smile. They didn't seem to think of this as a chore. Cabin crew were helpful and joked with some passengers. IFE is a little dated since they used the old IFE but with bigger screens. Seats pretty wide and legroom was standard. Aisle seats are bad as they had an IFE box below. Fortunately the flight was only 70% full and I switched to the 2nd seat. In conclusion this trip is value for money and good service like always from SQ.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,6,Van Hiep Hoang,17th March 2014,SQ175 HAN-SIN on March 9 2014 seat 16D Airbus A330 300. Pros: nice food and wine very good entertainment and service. Cons: although seat is indicated full flat it is not possible for aircraft designed for short distance. Relatively low choice of magazines no menu for food they only show it to you very briefly. Very small overhead locker even my specially designed cabin luggage would not fit into any locker of the ATR 72. Slightly chaotic situation if you change seats at check-in.,,,Business Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,3,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,10,Jill Whitehead,17th March 2014,We have just returned from Asia and this was the first time we had flown with Singapore airlines. Having contacted their customer services before our flight I have to say the service was excellent. We travelled on a A380 airbus and we sat upstairs. Comfort leg room food and service during our flight were better than we have experienced with any other airline. We travelled to Bangkok via Singapore and our return was from Hanoi via Singapore. We sat in 78ac and 72 ac on our return. The service was excellent. Our luggage was transferred to our final destination. All staff on the flight were kind helpful and made the journey a pleasure. Well done Singapore Airlines we would definitely fly with them again.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,5,D Thomas,14th March 2014,Flew Manchester to Sydney via Munich and Singapore and then same route on return. I had heard positive things about Singapore Airlines but to be honest I was quite disappointed. The service was better than rival airlines but was not fantastic. At least they did offer drinks at frequent intervals. The seats were uncomfortable and the cabin temperature was cold. On the outgoing Singapore/Sydney sector it was really far too cold. The food was absolutely awful. I ordered a vegetarian meal and except for the meal out of Sydney it was virtually inedible. If you have a nut allergy don't fly with this airline as packets of nuts are given out freely. I'm not sure if I would fly with SA again.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,,2,no
Singapore Airlines customer review,3,Peter Borschberg,12th March 2014,Outbound and return flight from Singapore to Taipei in economy class. Flights were seriously delayed both ways without giving passengers due prior notification. On the outbound leg in Singapore we sat in the plane for about 2 hours before we could take off. On-board service was so-so and the food was virtually inedible. No wonder everyone seemed to have ordered a special meal.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,,2,no
Singapore Airlines customer review,1,K Wright,10th March 2014,A380 LHR to SIN ok seats less comfortable than original seating plan. Inflight entertainment faulty but viewable. Boeing 777-200 to Christchurch on tired and dated planes. Terrible seats and 17 inch. Return journey no inflight entertainment for >40 seats from take off. After 9 hours rebooted system as IFE had now gone down in business also. Poor that it was now clear the problem could have been solved sooner if they were at all bothered. Terrible customer service. Boeing 777-300 new touch screens but the plane noise is so loud almost impossible to hear the movies when sat just behind wing. No snacks offered during 13 hour flight. Not recommended.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,1,no
Singapore Airlines customer review,8,M Benedicte,6th March 2014,Singapore to Zurich on A380 - overall good. Good selection of food option flight had some turbulence. Frankfurt to Singapore on A380.

Singapore Airlines customer review,8,O Castro,3rd March 2014,Flew from LHR-SIN on 18th Feb 2014 the majority of the crews on flight were outstanding except for one male crew who was a bit rude when I asked for a cup of noodles the initial response was that they didn't have anymore stock and breakfast would be served soon. Apart from this I was still satisfied with the staff service food and inflight entertainment.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3,yes

Singapore Airlines customer review,8,T Sellicks,27th February 2014,LHR to SIN on 15th Feb returning on 26th both legs on 777-200ER. Both legs with window seats. Staff and service excellent food (Asian option) choices excellent and delicious. Plentiful water juice and hot drinks between meals as well as light bites. Hot towels before each meal. IFE selection gargantuan with superb easy to use handset. Seats outbound far more comfortable than on the return sector. For service and inflight experiences one of the nicest I have enjoyed definitely the carrier of choice to South East Asia and Changi airport is a thing of beauty.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,10,Nick Ware,25th February 2014,SQ318 SIN to LHR 23 Feb A380-800 Business Class. Excellent flight in every respect. On time. Excellent service throughout. Top quality food and drink. The seat and bed were both extremely comfortable. Having flown out on Boeing 777 300 ER (see separate earlier report) with the compromised and uncomfortable new business class seat / bed I was surprised how much more comfortable the older seat / bed arrangement is on the A380. The only aspect that is not superior on the A380 is the screen which is larger and sharper on the 777 with the new business class. This was an excellent flight and I now know to try to pick Singapore flights with the A380 and to avoid the 777.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,10,D Meredith,25th February 2014,Flew on 22/2/14 from Brisbane to Singapore then onwards to Heathrow. The first flight was on a new A330-300 the second on an almost as new Boeing 777-300 ER. Both flights were just superb. The cabin crew as ever were attentive friendly and professional. The food on both flights was very good even though we were in cattle class. We have used them many times to Australia and they are always excellent.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,6,B Draeco,24th February 2014,Singapore-London on a B777.

Singapore Airlines customer review,10,M Giacomo,20th February 2014,Flew Milan-Singapore-Chiang Mai and return Singapore Airlines + Silk Air aircraft. Costly ticket (worth 1000 EUR instead of 700/800 EUR of competitors') but you get uncrowded cabins and premium feeling both on-board and at S'pore airport. Gulf carriers cabin crew should really take classes from Singapore Airlines' staff!,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,10,B Smithson,20th February 2014,MEL-SIN-NGO A330 J. Two perfect flights. Very comfortable seats. Fantastic crew who didn't forget a thing Bollinger champagne terrific meals (my Indian lamb shank ordered via Book The Cook was the best dish I have had on a plane). Comfortable spacious cabin plenty of overhead bin space addressed by name more movies than I could get through. Flights departed and arrived on time Changi a very easy airport to transit through. It was very clear why Singapore Airlines remains one of the very best airlines in the world.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,8,Davide Greco,19th February 2014,SQ469 Colombo to Singapore on Feb 10th. Back with them after almost 4 years I had again a positive experience despite the terrible schedule out of CMB (leaving at 1.30am): brand new A330-300 great and attentive crew and entertainment system displayed on a big PTV. During my previous experience with them I remember the seats were more comfortable and softer on their B777 but the legroom is still far above average for economy and service outstanding. Arrival to Changi on time and out of the terminal in less than half an hour really a fantastic airport in terms of facilities and organization.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,3,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,9,Virginia Bolton,18th February 2014,Flew Singapore Airlines to Yangon Myanmar return. Excellent flights - all on time. Service and leg room very good.

Singapore Airlines customer review,9,Harsh Mehta,17th February 2014,Recently I traveled on B777-200ER from Mumbai to Singapore. It was a very comfortable flight. The Economy Class seats are quite comfortable with good in-flight entertainment system but yes some improvements in the system are required. The lavatories of B777-200 are way too small. It feels claustrophobic sometimes and has no window. Crew were very helpful and responsive. Overall a good option to travel long haul.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,10,D Bryant,10th February 2014,Recently travelled from London Heathrow to Singapore then Singapore to Brisbane. Travelled alone first time.

I would highly recommend these airlines to everyone travelling long haul.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,7,Nick Ware,7th February 2014,SQ319 from LHR to SIN on the 777 300ER with new business class. Generally a good flight with excellent service good food and fantastic entertainment. The big downside is the new seat / bed. This has been ineptly designed and suffers from several really irritating issues that should have been resolved before it was rolled out. The seat is wide and has no side or lumbar support so whatever position you adopt it is not good for the back and not comfortable. The armrest to one side contains the table and a a small locker. Both are opened by pushing down. As these are exactly where your arm naturally rests they keep popping up which is annoying. When flipped over into bed mode the mattress is very hard. You have to lie at a diagonal angle due to restricted length and this is not comfortable. A further problem is that seat belt when in bed mode is an inertia reel seat belt - it is far too sensitive so if you turn onto your side or at least try too it locks and stops you turning and then you have to stop again very gently pull it out before completing the turn. It is nearly a great seat and bed but suffers from too many basic flaws which could and should have been spotted and resolved by the designer. Disappointing. Other than the poor bed / seat and lack of an amenity kit a good flight.,,,Business Class,,,2.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,3,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,6,L Coupe,5th February 2014,Recently returned from Melbourne via Singapore. The seat on the trip from Singapore to Manchester was really uncomfortable as a result I have a bruised coccyx which is still painful. The stop in Munich is a complete pain and makes for a horrendous journey time about 16 hours. Would think twice before booking with Singapore again.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,3,no
Singapore Airlines customer review,6,Casper Yap,5th February 2014,HKG-SIN-KUL. Older plane a bit dirty. IFE on the blink. Need to get newer planes for these flight segments. Staff experience was great without complaints. Used FF but difficult to get seats and the airline surcharges were high paying like a coach seat. Had to use all FF as they were expiring and not renewable.,,,Business Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,3,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,8,Caroline Kinnear,3rd February 2014,MEL-SIN-MEL in January 2014 in Economy Class. Seats 39 (Aisle) on way up 34 (aisle) on return leg. 747-300 MEL- SIN the 380 on the SIN-MEL leg. Check in for this flight was very slow the flight was as a consequence 30 minutes late leaving with no apology for the delay. The plane on the way to Singapore (the refitted 747) was much more comfortable in my view than the A380. The refitted 747 is not as wide as the 380 the seats seemed to be more comfortable and certainly had better lumbar support. The service was faultless on the way up. The beverage service quite prompt and the inflight meal looked OK. A further snack was served about 1.5 hours prior to landing. The red-eye flight on the way back to Melbourne on the A380 was OK but not great. However the flight left on time the meals and beverage service was efficient and the meal was adequate if nothing special. The seat however was not comfortable - not enough lumbar support and I had back ache for some days afterwards. The blanket provided was of good quality and nice and warm. The crew were efficient as is usual for Singapore Airlines but not very friendly. One of the toilets in the economy cabin was made unavailable for passengers with no explanation as to why. Information given out by 2 crew members about the flight wasn't accurate - they said the arrival time would be 30 minutes earlier than the actual arrival time but in the end we landed on time. However we were kept waiting once we landed and had to stay on the plane at Melbourne airport. Very frustrating after a long flight. However overall having flown with a number of airlines Singapore Airlines is definitely probably one of the better ones. Both the ground staff and the cabin crew are relatively on the ball. There are loads of choices for in-flight entertainment although I wish they would make the headphones more user-friendly and comfortable to wear - after about a couple of hours they hurt my ears and I could not make them short enough to fit comfortably at all. The service is very efficient and the planes are pretty comfortable although I would not recommend the A380 for a long night flight.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,3,Clare Howard,3rd February 2014,Just returned from trip to UK via Manchester (from Melbourne) had ordered (and phoned prior to trip) to order special meals as have a sugar allergy. Very disappointed as the meals were hopeless. Offered me fruit coleslaw sugar-free jelly (inedible) all unsuitable. Am so disappointed that in this day and age that either a nutritionist or dietician does not oversee these 'special meals'. The cabin crew were very kind and did their best but it was woefully inadequate and on this basis am unlikely to travel this airline again.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,,2,no
Singapore Airlines customer review,10,Carol Roestorf,30th January 2014,I was a passenger on 4 flights between December and end of January 2014. Johannesburg to Singapore was good with excellent staff service and 5 star service for everything. Singapore to Adelaide the staff were less attentive. Adelaide to Singapore my return was again 5 star service. The cabin crew were visible the whole time. Singapore to Johannesburg was not a good flight. My screen did not work properly my headset was not working and as a diabetic traveller the lack of food service was panic stations for myself. As we left at 2.10 in the morning a filled bread roll for the entire flight back does not suffice. I explained to the staff that I needed to have something to eat and was afforded a small bread roll and an apple. Snacks were available but they do not take the place of a meal for passengers. Meals are necessary for diabetics and they cannot travel on snacks for 8 hours especially as the inbound flight would have also just served a snack prior to landing.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,9,K Peterson,28th January 2014,MLE-SIN SIN-PER on A330-300. Flight was Male to Singapore was on a fairly dated aircraft. There were dirt and scuff marks across most of the surfaces which detracted from the feeling of luxury! Good service though and food and meals were of a high standard. Singapore to Perth flight was a much newer and cleaner aircraft with fantastic staff. This flight would be a 10/10 and by comparison the flight from Male was lacking in the service area. Seat was quite difficult to sleep on as angled seats are used.,,,Business Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,9,Saltis Harald,24th January 2014,Great flight all round! I flew SYD-SIN and really enjoyed my flight on Singapore's A380. The inflight entertainment was great with all the latest movies and TV shows. I was lucky enough to be sitting on the upper deck which offers more cabin space. The food was great and had a good variety of Western and Asian food. The seats were comfortable and had an ok recline. The cabin attendants were friendly and always had a smile!,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,4,yes

Singapore Airlines customer review,9,Anders Pedersen,23rd January 2014,Excellent trip in Boeing 777-200. Flight delayed 45 Minutes. Request for certain seat was accommodated and the flight was only half full resulting in several empty seats given options for sleep. Service good and 2-3 hot meals were served (dinner hot snacks breakfast). Staff hard working and professional.

Singapore Airlines customer review,8,H Watson,22nd January 2014,Flew Paris CDG-SIN-SYD. First leg was on the A380 and we were seated in exit row seats on the upper deck. Much quieter and nicer than downstairs. The attendants were great food pretty good and as it was a long flight there were trays of drinks and snacks available at the back - you could just help yourself. Flight left about 30 mins late but still arrived in SIN on time. Second leg from SIN-SYD was on an older 777. Seats nowhere near as comfortable very few movies on an old entertainment system. The attendants on this leg weren't as good either they just didn't seem interested in helping compared to the other leg. So the first flight was wonderful the second one not so much. Singapore Airlines is still very good and recommend it.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,3,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,10,Michael Rouse,15th January 2014,Manchester-Singapore-Sydney return. Brilliant service good food for economy class.

We will use them again.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,9,G Treano,14th January 2014,HND-SIN-JNB-SIN-NRT. Took off late from HND in an A330 due to aircraft arrival. Cabin crew did a good job. No amenity kits distributed. Seat had a lot of space and IFE was loaded with good selections. Had the Japanese style breakfast which was good. Later served refreshment (had a choice) which was nice. I had the Spaghetti and Eggplant really good. Cabin crew made continuous drink runs. A330 had dirty seats that needed cleaning or replacement but a good flight. Took off late from SIN in a revamped 777-200. Lots of space and legroom. Amenity kits distributed. Refreshment was a sandwich and I fell asleep after eating. Had the Omelette for Breakfast. Really good. IFE was not loaded up. Arrived early into JNB. Ground staff at JNB really nice and friendly for being 0605 in the morning. JNB-SIN took off on time. Full flight and again in a revamped 777-200. Amenity kits distributed. Served lunch after an hour. I had the braised pork which was really good. Fell asleep but was awakened by the constant snack runs of sandwiches which were small but very tasty. Constant wine refills were also done. Fruit cookies and chips were also distributed as snacks. For Breakfast asked for chicken but was served the Omelette with sausage. No complaints as it was perfect! Arrived into SIN early. SIN-NRT gate said closed but they were letting pax check in. Seemed like boarding took forever. Took off on time in A380. Seat was cramped and smaller than 777-200 and A330 seats. Served lunch I had the Japanese selection it was ok. Fell asleep and was occasionally awakened to cabin crew doing drink runs. Aircraft seemed to be really cold. Landed in NRT early. With all the late UA flights arriving Immigration was a nightmare! The last flight seemed to be a little low on standards but overall Singapore Airlines is still right up there next to ANA.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,9,S Palmer,13th January 2014,London to Singapore Singapore to Sydney 5th January 2014. We had our dates mixed up and turned up to the airport for the wrong flight a day late. This was our fault and Singapore Airlines were very helpful and managed to put us on the next flight (the one we wrongly turned up for). We were not charged anything for this and the ground staff were very professional and helpful. The flight were good seats were as comfortable as economy gets and the entertainment was excellent. The cabin crew were polite and very professional. The food was really good. Because we were headed all the way to Sydney we had to try and get on another flight at Singapore. Once again the ground staff were helpful and professional and put us on the next flight to Sydney at no additional cost. The second flight was as good as the first with comfortable seating great entertainment and service and good food. All round very pleased with Singapore Airlines and grateful!,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,5,Shu Wen Teo,13th January 2014,Flew economy from LA to SIN in May 2013. The seat is spacious and provides enough legroom. However I was utterly disappointed with the service. I fell asleep when they were handing out the meals. I woke up when all the passengers were just about to dig in and I immediately asked for my meal. But I was told that they had run out of lunch and the rude air stewardess walked away without offering anything else. Aren't they supposed to have enough meals for everyone? Even though the air stewardess offered 2 small bags of chips later this still did not make up for it. Light snacks for main meal? I don't think so.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,,2,no
Singapore Airlines customer review,10,Imtiaz Riadi,13th January 2014,CGK-SIN-DEL SQ 967 and SQ 406. Connection time more than sufficient. The seat was comfortable but not fully flat. The meal choices I had on the CGK-SIN Route were Rendang and Lasagne. I tried the Rendang and it was delicious soft tender and quite spicy. The TV was sufficient and I'm thankful they have charging port on the SQ 406. I slept for the rest of the flight and managed to do some last minute inflight shopping before landing.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,4,yes

Singapore Airlines customer review,9,Anders Pedersen,10th January 2014,SGN-SIN-SYD on 9th January 2014. First leg on B770-200. Excellent and proactive ambitious and diligent staff whether old or young. Seats not lie flat but no need for a two hours ride. Lounge access food and drinks very good. 3-4 options for hot food given! The Bollinger champagne is now replaced. No cheese table could be offered. No wifi available. SIN-SYD on A380-800. The cabins provide some privacy. Beds are flat but not fully horizontal a small angle of 3-4% remains disturb sleeping and annoys. The TV screens are heavily light reflecting and are more mirrors than TVs – what a disaster as compared to the investment. The tray tables are in a funny skew position forcing the gourmand to lean sideways while eating. Disappointed by this seat furthermore its hard to operate. Food is excellent and options are plenty. No cheese table offered. No wifi available. FAs were kind caring and attentive. SQ is the only airline serving stout beer - quite charming. Wines are good and food is good as well.,,,Business Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,4,yes

Singapore Airlines customer review,8,A Turner,9th January 2014,Flew economy from Frankfurt to Singapore. Food was decent leg space sufficient. A very smooth flight with good customer service. Our flight out of Frankfurt was delayed due to bad weather in New York missed our connecting flight from Singapore to Perth as a result. We were very impressed with their service in this situation. They organised a room and paid a return taxi fare to the very nice Hotel Village Changi. We spent most of our 10 hour wait there eating the free buffet meals and resting in the comfortable room. Although we were frustrated that we were so severely delayed having a hotel room and meals provided made the situation less stressful.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,5,Nick Hodgson,8th January 2014,MEL-SIN Business in December. I was surprisingly disappointed on this trip aboard their 777-300ER aircraft. Granted the newer Business class was not yet installed but overall I wasn't all that impressed with the quality of the seat which looked rather tired. The lounge in Melbourne is barely comparable to a domestic Virgin Australia lounge since they have split it into Business/First and had a very poor food and beverage offering. Despite requesting not to be woken for breakfast service during the flight to maximise sleep I was. Not a picky traveler and not a regular Business traveler either but found myself a little disappointed at the offering considering the hype.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,,3,no

The A380 was late due to non communicated reasons - no Economy Class in Upper Deck were available thus our long lasting reservations were cancelled and we got rather poor seats in the aft of the airplane. The meal was 'overcooked' thus not edible service was non-existent we had to get our drinks ourselves in the galley.¨It was the lousiest flight to Asia we have experienced.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,1,no
Singapore Airlines customer review,6,K Lakshmanan,3rd January 2014,"Flew from Singapore to Dubai in Economy class and I hate the seat configuration. Its 3-4-3 which doesn't give you any privacy if you're travelling with a partner. There are few ""couple seats"" but unfortunately all were booked a month before departure. The seats were quite cramped. No power outlet to charge you mobile phones. The food that was served was the worst airline meal ever had. Totally bland and overcooked chicken. Cheap ice creams. Crew were monotonous and especially one of them who went around asking ""would you like to have a coffee or tea"" non-stop. it took forever for the crew to finish their meal service which resulted in longer time to serve coffee and tray collections.

Kris-world was excellent with a wide range of movies including recently release new movies for our entertainment. It's only a 4 hrs flight but to have an IFE onboard made it such a wonderful experience to enjoy your 4hrs. Meals were good and ice cream was given for the first leg return leg had a new selection of movies which I always enjoyed having. And the best thing was they had a Christmas menu and it was excellent with turkey and log cakes. Delayed arrival entering Singapore due to heavy traffic and captain informed us of the delay. Overall a wonderful experience and SQ has kept its high standards in service and quality once again.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,10,Shoumik Datta,29th December 2013,I travelled from Singapore to Kolkata and back during the month of December and I have to say that the service is far better than any other carrier. During the night flight back to Singapore passengers were given Givenchy amenity kits. The food was also very nice and tasty and we were given a menu card before departure which I felt was a nice touch. The last thing I wish to highlight is that the inflight entertainment Krisworld was excellent and all the latest blockbusters were available onboard. I was totally spoilt for choice during the short 3 hour 50 minutes flight. Strongly recommended to everyone.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,2,L Hang,29th December 2013,18th December from Brisbane to Singapore. I have been taking varied airlines such as Qantas Emirates for this same route over the years. I have to say that I am quite disappointed with the service and that there has indeed been a decline in SIA's standards in this area. I ordered a special vegetarian oriental meal whilst checking in online. As it was served first our drink orders were not taken. My vegetarian meal came with only a piece of bread and the main meal. It was extremely oily and I had no salad or fruit to go with it. I was also refused a dessert as I was told special meals had their own desserts. I never received anything. I was also never served a drink until I asked the stewardess clearing the trays if I could get one. Even then she said she would get back to me and never did. I also tried to do some inflight shopping but the airline had extremely limited stock of the products in the catalogue. Most of the products were not in stock at all. I think compared to the competitors for this same leg SIA is definitely below average. I would think twice before paying this much when I can get a cheaper flight with better service.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,,1,no
Singapore Airlines customer review,7,Nicholas Tan,29th December 2013,SQ976 to Bangkok from Singapore: okay service on 20 December. SQ981 came back to Singapore from Bangkok: much better service. They left the light on for my father who was reading staff were much friendlier and were happy to serve. Both flights on A330 in-flight entertainment had lots of selection.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,7,H Yaacob,25th December 2013,SIN-FCO-SIN on SQ366/365. The crews on both flights were outstanding and accommodating to our requests. Nonetheless there was a handful of crew members who whilst polite were rather cold and didn't appear to be interested in going the extra mile. I've noticed this lately on SIA but this was made up by the exceptional service rendered by the rest of the crew. We ordered special meals. Food on the outbound was excellent though our vegetarian meal on the inbound was very bland and not fulfilling at all. IFE selection was mediocre at best. Movie and TV selection was limited and disappointing. This tends to be the case on SIA it's a bit of a hit and miss. Emirates has its act together much better in this area. We got a refurbished 772 which was nice. Legroom was great. However the hard seat cushions made sitting down a bit uncomfortable after a while and ill-placed IFE remotes which were on the armrests. Your legs would keep knocking against the controls. Overall it was an above average flight and I would use SQ again. Though I wouldn't be adamant. It wasn't spectacular and I'm sure they're competitors can offer equally good flights.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,,3,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,10,S Tibble,23rd December 2013,LHR to SIN 10th Dec. Business class flight on the A380. After use of lounge boarded plane easily and was directed to my seat by FA. Offered drinks went for Champagne and also asked about post take off drinks. Offered papers and magazines for the journey. Seat very comfy and although a night flight did not have put into bed mode I found more than enough adjustment with recline and I am 5 ft 11. All meals were very good with plenty of choice and all presented very well. Drinks service very good with friendly crew in galley whenever I wanted something. Arrival in Singapore very good flight crew said goodbye and all seem to have been pleased to see us. Although this was the a380 I think the renewed 777 offering is better.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,9,H Watson,17th December 2013,We arrived in Paris today flying SYD-SIN-CDG both legs on the A380. We were seated in upper deck economy which is much better than the lower deck (quieter less people smaller seat configuration). The staff service on both legs was excellent - lots of drink runs and when I discovered one of the earphones on my headset wasn't working I was promptly given a new one. Staff always had a smile and were polite. Seats comfortable food not too bad for economy. Only drawback was the entertainment system could have had more movies.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,3,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,1,Gary Lohman USA),17th December 2013,Perth to Houston TX on SQ 062 my wife and I. Flight to Moscow aborted at last minute routed to Warsaw where Singapore Airlines had no affiliation. Sat on plane for 2 hours after landing in Warsaw then escorted to airport. Once in the lounge and able to check flights we saw we had been booked on a flight to Paris and to Houston the next morning. Went to gate and told we had no ticket for this flight went back to where we originally left and there was a SA rep. After some time told we could not take this flight. Told to gather luggage and go to a hotel. Told we were being put on a plane to Copenhagen then to Chicago and then to Houston arriving 36 hours after planned arrival. Inquired why we could not take flight to Paris as previously scheduled connection time now too close and airline would not book. In summary I have been flying internationally my entire oil field career over 30 years I have experienced delays cancellations re-routes etc. I have never seen such a poor handling of a situation as this. I have always chosen Singapore when possible but will think twice in the future.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,,1,no
Singapore Airlines customer review,8,K Kapasi,17th December 2013,We flew BOM-SIN-BOM earlier this year for a 10 day holiday in Singapore. The flights were great both ways and we were extremely happy with the choice of food. For BOM-SIN me and my son tried the Lamb dish - but did not like it. The crew promptly replaced this with the available veg choice. The return sector actually had a better choice of Indian food. Beverages choice was also great - and of course they had Tiger beer! Good and no nonsense comfortable flight.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,10,J Adam,17th December 2013,LHR-SIN-SYD both legs on A380. I couldn't recommend this airline any more. Great legroom for economy and seat pitch hot towels before take off some of the best food I have had in the sky regular drinks service great entertainment system with Krisworld clean cabin (they even had some Xmas decorations up). FA'S were very helpful and the girls were dressed impeccably in their Singapore girl outfits and always smiling and willing to help. The added plus of Changi airport being SQ's hub made transit a very pleasant experience. If you're flying the A380 v1 seating plan - I recommend booking an upper deck economy ticket a small dedicated cabin at the back of the upper deck provides a smaller quieter experience. This is a 5 star airline and blows my home airline BA out of the water. You will not be disappointed! They made over 10000 miles in the air somewhat enjoyable!,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,9,F Wong,12th December 2013,SQ2 from SIN to HKG on Dec 9th was delayed 5 hours due to faulty parts they had to change aircraft to fly us all home. Despite that there were enough staff to attend to us we were kept informed of the situation very clearly Free drinks and snack boxes provided. Then a dinner up to SGD 15 was provided for us. Staffs were visible ally he time to answer question and calm our fears. When finally boarding we were given a small token as an apology. Arrived in HK at past 2 am we were given free coaches as well as taxi fares to go home depending on our destination. I could not complain but praise this airlines for treating their customers right. Truly deserving its 5 star status all the way! On board the 777-300ER seat was comfortable good AVOD crew were hard working frequent drink top ups and good quality late dinner served. Overall I am impress and will not hesitate to fly with them again and again.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,3,Sylvia Mascheroni,10th December 2013,On 23 November I got SQ 068 to Sao Paulo and I was really surprised to see the cleanliness of the aircraft. Unfortunately due to connecting flight problems I lost my flight back to Barcelona and I could not compare - and perhaps change my mind - the poor state of maintenance of aircraft's. I don't think I will be flying again with Singapore but it is also however the best option to fly from Barcelona to Montevideo.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,,3,no
Singapore Airlines customer review,2,Jana Prime,9th December 2013,On 15/11/13 flight from Brisbane to Singapore leaving at 23.45 was the worst flight with this airline. Old plane no leg room poor service I was flabbergasted as I have been flying with them for years. Coming home the plane was up to their usual standard but I will be very wary of flying or recommending them in the future.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,,2,no
Singapore Airlines customer review,8,M Abbott,9th December 2013,Singapore - Zurich and return. On the A380 with all business class seating on the upper deck. Overall a very good trip. Departure from SIN is scheduled very late (01.30) so I had no problem getting off to several hours sleep at that time of the morning. Coming back is a daytime flight which I personally find more tiring. Anyway the product remains a solid one. The service was very good. Food and drinks all fine. Still think the IFE system is showing its age compared to say Emirates but quite OK and had no problem finding a few movies to watch on the daytime return flight. My complaints remain the same as ever. The business class seat is plain weird and for taller types like me the diagonal sleeping position is only just long enough. In addition SQ start to look expensive compared to the Gulf carriers for the route I was travelling (SIN-ZRH-NCE) by a couple of thousand S$ which is substantial.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,3,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,6,Peter Riddell,9th December 2013,I've recently flown on SQ 423 BOM-SIN connecting SQ217 SIN-MEL in J Class. Can I say at the outset the crew on SQ and their service to the business class passenger is wonderful. I used points to upgrade and it was a rare experience for me to enjoy J class so was really keen to sample SQ business class. Great sized LCD TV screen brand new cabin on SQ423 wide seats and such a massive sense of space! Amazingly for a post-midnight departure ex Mumbai we were served a full 3 course meal which was lovely but it's almost impossible to sleep on a full stomach. Much more logical to serve a light snack on departure and full breakfast before Singapore surely? The menu didn't indicate this was an option to be requested so I assume no breakfast service was available. The seat in recline position was great and quite comfortable but it was after putting the bed down to try and sleep the discomfort began. A very hard lumpy bed from the various joins and cushions. And the massive belt that pins you to the bed is totally uncomfortable. I felt like I was tied to the bed couldn't turn over couldn't breathe and ended up having to sit back up again. Equals no sleep! So so disappointing. I'm happy to drape a seat belt over me while sleeping I'm not prepared to be tied down! SQ 217 on the SIN-MEL leg was an old version of the 1-2-1 config. Dirty walls worn leather seats small TV drinks placed on the shelf at the front so it was a case of having to undo the seat belt and stretch out to take it. Beautiful food excellent service lovely lovely crew. But again the hard uncomfortable bed. A less than enjoyable experience I won't be travelling SQ business again.,,,Business Class,,,2.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,4,no
Singapore Airlines customer review,2,Jana Prime,9th December 2013,On 15/11/13 flight from Brisbane to Singapore leaving at 23.45 was the worst flight with this airline.

Singapore Airlines customer review,8,A Difiori,7th December 2013,Flight SQ317 (LHR-SIN) on 30th November 2013 seat 27K on upper deck. Check-in was fast although I understand that one of the check-in assistants was rude to my colleague by suggesting it was obvious he'd not flown business class before but hey we were in England and you can't complain about poor service here. The flight itself was fine. I had used BTC for the food. The only let down was the breakfast which was bizarre. I had pre-ordered multigrain toast after a few mis-understandings on what it came with I decided to stay with this choice however I wish I had not. It consisted of 2 pieces of what was more like chipboard than toast accompanied by grilled asparagus carrots aubergine and courgettes and on the same place was a sweet pastry. Not sure who makes up the dishes but this certain was not complimentary to each other. All the veg were dry and chewy. Having usually flown Virgin business class in the past I was used to having my bed made for me but this does not happen in SIA flights also the bed even though lay flat was designed in a way that for me at 6ft2 was very uncomfortable. Overall not a bad experience just some oddities.,,,Business Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,7,A Fox,7th December 2013,LHR-SIN-PER return. First leg fantastic upstairs economy on the A380 flight half full with plenty of room stretch out flight attendants friendly attentive very enjoyable. Both legs to and from Perth comfortable enough but nothing to rave about. Return from Singapore was terrible. Boarding call for flight was a late and all classes families with children etc. we're called within in minutes apart total chaos ensued. First class business and economy all cramming in a rush to get on felt like budget airline experience. Flight was full with no room to move attendants stretched to handle the demands of anxious late night passengers lots of small children it's a thin line between a good and a bad flight in economy when full. Still the better economy airline for long haul.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,9,A Difiori,7th December 2013,Flight SQ318 (SIN-LHR) Suite 3A. I had the fortune to fly in one of the suites on my return trip. The service in this class is what you would expect private entrance at the airport with the added bonus of a separate security channel. I was taken to the SilverKris lounge and upgraded from the 1st class lounge to the private room. This was a great experience especially having a cook to order breakfast service and a nice sized dinning room. The boarding service itself with a private walkway to the suites was very speedy and as soon as I arrived at the plane door you are taken to your suite by a steward. Seated and then given a guided tour of all the facilities and features. The service itself was amazing if not a little over attentive but being served my the most senior stewards you would expect this. The food was good although some items were a little overcooked. I would recommend this but only if you have about 10k to spend without missing it. The suite itself it very comfortable and when the bed is made it was large enough for me to lay out fully even being 6ft2.,,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,2,L Michael,6th December 2013,"I have flown SQ for a long time but in the past couple of years I was disappointed to notice the decline in service. I fly between JFK and Singapore a lot and they have not changed the menu on the route in a while. The seats were also cramped and the legroom was awful. I'm 6 feet and my legs were pressed against the seat in from of me. The foot rest doesn't help at all if you are above 5'8"". Boarding is usually pushed back to about 10 minutes before the scheduled departure and the boarding staff in SIN didn't seem to care much. overall the service is now a far cry from what it used to be and I now refuse to fly with them.",,,Economy Class,,,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,,1,no
Singapore Airlines customer review,10,Jan Cafferty,6th December 2013,LHR-Singapore-Sydney/Melbourne-Singapore-LHR. Check in staff polite and efficient cabin crew attentive but not over bearing food as good as you can get when flying drinks readily available and plentiful and seat that comfortable I slept the majority of each flight. All in all a very pleasant experience I always fly Singapore Airlines when flying to Australia.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,8,Xiao Steve,6th December 2013,SIN-HND the end of November with Boeing 777-300 (non-ER).

Singapore Airlines customer review,10,K Le Quang,4th December 2013,Perfect airline to me! Every time I had to fly in a long-haul flight I chose SQ because of its high quality service. It never let me down. The flight from Auckland to Changi SIN was as excellent as usual. Food was great and plenty. The staffs also recommended me to try Singapore Sling and it was great. Whenever I woke up during the night I always saw the crew's smiles. The transfer at Changi Airport was very good too!,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,6,B Vincent,2nd December 2013,I flew PER-SIN on a 777 and SIN-SUB on A330 last month. Good points: punctual comfortable seats great food great IFE (when you get the chance to use it). Bad points: On these aircraft types at least Singapore Airlines aircraft don't have individual air vents and it can become incredibly stuffy especially on the 777 where the cabin temperature was too hot - not the first time I have had this problem. Also the Surabaya flight was about 2hrs 15min which should have been enough to take in a 90 minute movie; but they didn't turn on Krisworld until about 30 minutes after pushback then 70 min later they collected the headsets and said they would be turning it off. In fact Krisworld kept running for another 30 minutes and was only turned off 15 minutes before landing. Had I known this I could have continued to watch the movie with subtitles - I think this was very poorly managed. Why can't they have IFE throughout the flight? - Qantas manages it.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,,4,no
Singapore Airlines customer review,9,Frank Gan,2nd December 2013,Flew from Singapore to Osaka and back in November 2013.

It was an experience that is worth the premium.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,5,yes

I will recommend and certainly fly with them again.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,8,R Fitra,27th November 2013,SIN-HKG-SIN. Check in at both airports were fast and efficient. The planes on both legs were the Boeing 777-200. The IFE on the plane is in serious need of upgrading. Watching movie was a struggle as the screen resolution is very low. Furthermore it can only be used after the plane took off and before it landed. This is in contrast to some Middle Eastern airlines where the IFE can be used right after stepping in to and before getting off the plane. The cabin crews were polite especially the one on the return leg. She was very helpful and full of smile. The special foods that I requested were available on both leg and tasted ok.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,10,D Duggins,27th November 2013,Flew out of Heathrow on 20th November flight 317 to Australia (via Singapore) the onward flight departed Singapore on 21st November flight number 217 to Melbourne. Quite simply the best airline we've flown with. All staff immaculately dressed and turned out. Customer service was second to none. All other airlines should aspire to be like this. British Airways take note you need to up your game.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes

Singapore Airlines customer review,9,Franz Koepernik,21st November 2013,I've been flying SQ now for more than 30 years (Business and Y-Cl/Longhaul and shorthaul) and have never experienced any problems with this airline: Last Flight: MUC-MAN return: at both airports no queues at check-in organised boarding friendly and helpful crews even on this short route choice of different snacks and additional drink rounds and full IFE. Prices below Easyjet fares on this route! Flights on time or ahead of schedule! There are only 2 small negative points for this route: quite early departure from MUC (06.10 am) and since some time you are not any more allowed to earn LH Miles on this route despite SQ is a STAR Alliance member.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,10,E Saunders,21st November 2013,What a refreshing experience. We travelled to Singapore less expensive than alternatives and better value for money. Our flight was on time the plane clean modern and well presented. The staff delightful on both outbound and Inbound journeys impeccably presented and with a welcoming smile. They were attentive and went about the cabin helping passengers with a smile and minimum fuss. Unlike other airlines we had a printed menu the food was excellent served very nicely proper cutlery too. Ample choice of entertainment if you can't make a choice from all offered you're not trying. Very nice 'wake up' gradual using staged lighting relaxing music playing for landing. Could not fault this airline will be looking to book with Singapore Airlines again.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,9,P Hillier,21st November 2013,SIN-SYD. Flight not full so plenty of room on board.

Very satisfied and will continue to use this airline.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,7,I Boyle,18th November 2013,We flew SYD-SIN on 30 Sept 13 and had a wonderful flight. The staff were great and the food and wine very good. I would like to commend the purser for his kindness and help on this flight. The return flight on 10 Nov 13 was almost the opposite to the last flight. The food was not so good and overcooked. I regret my harsh comments to a staff member on the matter. I would still fly with Singapore in the future.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,9,T Teo,18th November 2013,KUL-SIN-BCN and return. Both on B777-300ER economy class. The aircraft seating was comfortable with good selection of inflight entertainment. Service is as usual impeccable and faultless. The cabin crew were very helpful attentive and generous with drinks and snacks in between flight. Just encountered some delay on return leg resulting in missed connection. Otherwise truly value for money.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,9,P Hillier,14th November 2013,SYD-SIN on 10 Nov 2013.

Singapore Airlines customer review,10,Lee Cheng Jun,14th November 2013,SIN-HKG return on A380s. I was lucky enough to be seated on the upper deck seats 74A and 76K. There was a side storage compartment beside the window seats. Upper deck economy cabin is a small cabin which contains around 80 seats. SIN-HKG I was greeted by the FA's with smiles food was very good. HKG-SIN flight an unusual announcement made by the captain about strong winds on the end of the airfield . Upon reaching 1500ft when engine power was reduced the plane felt a sudden drop in altitude causing most of the passengers including me to shout. Babies on board this route was also crying. When seatbelt signs were switched off staff were trying to keep the baby calm. I would recommend on the A380 to take seats on the upper deck as it is quieter and more attention from FA's.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,10,J Griffin,10th November 2013,Brisbane-Singapore-Shanghai. Crew friendly and helpful. A330-300 Brisbane to Singapore and Boeing 777 Singapore to Shanghai travelling in a group if 45 people. Return Beijing-Singapore-Brisbane with friendly crew members. Very good food on all flights and a wide range I movies on in-flight entertainment. Seats were very comfortable. Got a window seat nearly every time.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,9,C Kevin Santoso,6th November 2013,Flew CGK-SIN-FRA-JFK and LAX-NRT-SIN-CGK. SIN-FRA-JFK and LAX-NRT-SIN were on the Airbus A380 and Boeing 777-200 for both CGK-SIN and SIN-CGK. Flight was fine choices of food were great the inflight entertainment system was one of the best that i had ever used. Couldn't sleep on flight to JFK because the cabin was too noisy. But thank goodness that I could sleep peacefully on my way back from LAX to SIN. In terms of seating the seat was comfortable though there's still room for improvement maybe additional inches to the seat pitch would help. In the end I would definitely fly on Singapore Airlines again.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,10,M Marks,5th November 2013,SQ327 MAN-SIN via MUN. My first flight ever with Singapore Airlines and I was very impressed. On an Economy ticket the meal choices were amazing and I even had the chance to order snacks and sandwiches at any point in between meal service. The FT's were helpful and courteous no matter what the problem or request was. There were 2 downsides only. 1) Having to fly via Munich disembark and sit in the airport for 1.5hrs. 2) The individual screens had the movies on a rolling system so you had to wait until its run was over to start watching the film you wanted from the beginning. With all the films at different lengths this meant a lot of planning to get your timings right throughout the 16hr flight. Of course I wanted to sleep as well and due to the chairs being comfortable and the added help of a window seat I was able to get a few hrs. We arrived 45mins early so I was able to get my connecting flight to HKG with ease. Overall a very good quality flight and I would not hesitate to fly Singapore Airlines again.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,8,Matthew Tesch,5th November 2013,My first SQ experience in 35+ years travelling was a mixed bag in regional A330 Business class to/from SIN connecting with (other carrier) European flights. Service on outward SQ236 BNE-SIN sector reflected many online reviews I had read: zealously attentive but semi-robotic and impersonal. My change of seat at check-in from 14A to 14K obviously threw the pre-flight cabin briefing off its tracks it was not until the third F/A interaction after the seatbelt signs had been turned off in the climb to cruise that the penny dropped that neither my surname nor my gender matched those the crew were using in dealing with me. At times I felt like a participant in a training video or that the crew couldn't wait to get home. That said the inwards SQ235 SIN-BNE return and final sector of a long trip two weeks later was an outstanding contrast with the archetypal Singapore Girl service striking exactly the right note: attentive without being intrusive modulated and moderated without being mechanical and generally more relaxed comfortable and charming. An invitation to be briefed on the seat controls would have been nice – the SQ regional J-boxes being rather unique – but the food drink and Kris-World IFE could not be faulted. My first time changing terminals at SIN too was a pleasantly seamless experience the Silver Kris lounge and its staff set an example to the industry world-wide.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,10,M Marks,5th November 2013,SQ860 SIN-HKG. 777-200ER. After flying MAN-SIN via MUN this flight was my final leg. I was greeted by FT who when looking at my boarding pass knew straight away that I had a special dietary requirement. Throughout the flight this FT seemed to have remembered a certain number of people's names in our cabin and spoke to us only by using Mr or Mrs as a prefix to our personal names. I was overly impressed as this is something you just don't expect in Economy Class. The service was excellent with refreshments throughout the flight. FT's were friendly and didn't disturb you if you wanted to sleep. A very comfortable trip with personal entertainment lots of leg room and a very high standard of service. What more could you want?,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5,yes

Singapore Airlines customer review,9,C Joel,30th October 2013,SIN-BKK-SIN. Flew this leg on the 772 aircraft's which are one of the oldest in SIA's fleet. What was disappointing was the poor KrisWorld in-flight entertainment system. It was really old. The display on the screens were barely visible and that the buttons on the controls were hard to press. The seats was a bit cramped on the older planes. On food SIA met its expectations. I chose a seafood meal on the return trip and it was certainly appetizing.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,10,C Hoffmann,29th October 2013,SIN-FRA on A380 upper deck emergency exit seats 71 H&K. Note these seats have no overhead storage as they are full of first aid equipment so try to get on early as you will struggle to find space. Initial start to flight was not good with a 1 hour delay and later finding out that the TV screen did not lock into place. What happened next was nothing short of amazing and should be a lesson in customer service (Emirates I hope you read this as SIA economy is better than your Business Class). Leading stewardess managed to tape the screen in place and I was able to use for the rest of the flight with juts a minor inconvenience. I was offered the chance to move but declined as my wife and I wanted the extra leg room. Service was fantastic thought out the flight which staff coming around with drinks and snacks often (we were not singled out) We were given a voucher to use on duty free which we used straight away to buy a honeymoon present. On hearing this the leading FA said she had a surprise for us and later came back with a congratulatory gift of a slice of cake and 2 glasses of Dom Perignon from First Class. This was the best experience I had on a flight regardless of class. The last four flights on SIA have been very good and consistent it is also nice to see that the staff are allowed to let their personality shine through.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,9,C Hoffmann,29th October 2013,PER-SIN on B772 older aircraft with reduced entertainment selection. Seats were hard and in need of re-padding. Staff were friendly and genuine with a sense of humor. Also nice to see that they don't tell you every time that there is turbulence to sit down fasten seat belts etc once when it occurred was fine the rest of the time they assumed we listened. The last time I flew this leg the announcement was made 20 times. Good flight departed 15 min late arrived 15 min early.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,9,C Hoffmann,29th October 2013,FRA-SIN-PER. First leg on A380 upper deck window seat. Seat was ok for a 12 hour flight storage bin between seat and window was really handy. Service very good with FA friendly and come around often which drinks and snacks. Meals offered on both legs were much better than anything I have eaten on economy in a very long time. Entertainment system worked fine with enough movies to keep you entertained for 3 days non stop. B772 on second leg was an older plane but still clean seats offered a bit more leg room but were hard as padding seemed warn out. Standard of service was again excellent. Both flights delayed FRA was by 45min due to tower and SIN by 1.5 hours due to a connecting flight being late. Latter part annoying as it got me into Perth airport when 4 planes had landed around the same time. The airport cannot cope and took me 1.5 hours to get out. (not the airlines fault).,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,10,H Sharp,25th October 2013,Flew LHR-SIN and return. The flight into Singapore was on the new B77W that was really state of the art. The seats were indeed more spacious as advertised. The IFE was totally top-notch with the huge screen and countless entertainment options. Food was terrific on both flights. Back to London on the A380 with the older (although still quite new) product. I sat in the small cabin at the upper deck which is really a big plus since it was way more cosy. Staff on both flights were very friendly and welcoming as always. SIA is still my airline of choice while travelling to Asia or Australia.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,10,M Davies,23rd October 2013,MEL-SIN-KIX and FUK-SIN-MEL in Economy with MEL-SIN on A380 and all others on A330. Enjoyable flights in terms of comfort food and entertainment although the seats on the SIN-KIX leg was definitely a bit firmer than expected. Excellent service from cabin & ground service on all flights with the latter especially friendly & efficient at FUK. Probably the most consistently enjoyable food my wife and I have had on SIA or on any other carrier in Economy over the past 5 years or so. The entertainment system is extensive with more than enough choice for us although the advertising can be annoying after a while. A problem I experienced with the unit on the SIN-MEL flight was overcome when a particularly helpful cabin staff member re-started my system several times and then checked with me 2 or 3 times after that to ensure there had not been any further issues. SIA continues to be our airline of choice between MEL and Asia.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes

Unfortunately this route is disappearing very soon and I will miss the specially design all-business class airplane a lot. This day the service was spot-on the airplane/seat/configuration (1-2-1) food drinks - everything was exemplified ""best practice"".

Singapore Airlines customer review,10,H Lim,18th October 2013,A380 LHR-SIN Return sector of round-trip on 14/10/13. A faultless flight experience on the all-Business Class upper deck thanks to the swift check-in and boarding impeccable seat and cabin an exemplary cabin crew delicious meals and impressive IFE. No other airline offers such a calming inflight Business Class environment. I always arrive rested and refreshed after a long-haul flight with SIA and look forward to the next. It never fails to impress me how well-groomed the crew are (an important detail many passengers fail to notice such as the ambient music played at the right volume after landing) and how promptly attentive they are to passenger's needs. SIA remains polished peerless and focused on their product and services for the FIT. This flight demonstrated all SIA's qualities perfectly.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,5,M Cymbalak,16th October 2013,MEL-SIN-MAA-SIN-MEL. MEL to SIN on 777-300. SIN-MAA-SIN on A330-300. Home trip SIN to MEL on A380. Staff excellent. Food very good (book the cook). No amenity kit. Lounge food was OK but not great. Breakfast at MEL lounge was terrible I left and went to ANZ lounge. Lounge at MAA is not worth commenting (not great at all). The MAA to SIN flight is tough as it departs close to midnight and arrives in Singapore less than 4 hours later so not much time for decent sleep. But overall I was rather comfortable on the 777 and A330 angle seats. But the A380 lie flat bed is not long enough (am 6ft 1). Terrible night's sleep I couldn't fly Singapore again until they have a bed that caters for near average height people. Expected more from a reputable airline.,,,Business Class,,,1.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,3,no
Singapore Airlines customer review,7,K Turner,16th October 2013,"I have recently returned from a trip to Bali with Singapore Airlines. Overall the journey was ok. Outbound we were in economy cabin on the upper deck of the A380 and we were lucky enough to get seated in the rows of two seats which were comfortable enough. I'm 6.1"" and my travel companion is 6.3"" and in terms of leg room for us there was not a lot. There is also a foot rest fitted to the back of the seat in front which when raised digs in to your shins. When it's lowered you can stretch your legs out over it but it then digs in to your calf muscles. It's poor design and it does affect comfort somewhat but not to the point of distraction. There were plenty of entertainment options available. Both my partner and I had issues with the IFE on the outbound leg which lasted about 30 minutes but the steward was able to re-boot the system for us eventually. The food was good and plentiful and the service was also excellent. The crew were constantly passing through the cabin handing out water and juice and other drinks were available during the flight from the back of the plane. The flights to and from Bali were on a 777-200 and both were fine. One thing to note we were served curry on the flight to DPS and it was hot. Sinagpore may need to tone down the chilli a little. Return leg from SIN-LHR was on 777-300 and at boarding it didn't look like it would be a full flight. We were in the forward economy cabin and this filled up and most seats were taken. However the rear cabin was virtually empty and people here were quick to take up whole rows to themselves. There could have been a better distribution of passengers to allow everyone to have a bit more room. Overall a great airline which with a few tweaks could be fantastic. I certainly felt that with other airlines flying long haul I've had more room.",,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,10,G Hellings,15th October 2013,Flight SQ319 London to Singapore on 14/10/2013. Cabin crew were the nicest and most helpful crew we have come across in our travels.

Will definitely travel with them again.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,4,Mike Aronovich,15th October 2013,NRT-LAX A380 upon boarding cabin crew guided me to the wrong side of cabin and wrong seat. No menu was provided for the entire flight and I did not know which champagne or wine I was drinking nor did I know what to expect for dinner or breakfast. Only for the main course (entree) did the cabin crew provide a quick booklet which after choosing was quickly taken away again. After asking cabin crew for a little help to figure out how to convert my seat into bed I was asked if it was my first time with Singapore Airlines (I am Krisflyer Gold). Cabin crew never asked if I wanted to be awaken for breakfast (which I did not). After waking me up and providing me with a cup of coffee I waited 50 minutes for breakfast to be served. Again no menu. A rather disappointing service.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,,2,no
Singapore Airlines customer review,8,Christine Semken,15th October 2013,SYD - SIN - LHR - SIN - SYD. Flight attendants did their utmost to be polite and offer individual service which was very impressive. Loved the added extras. The movies were good and there was sufficient variety. I had special meals and they were plentiful and tasty. Lots of drinks offered. Seats were just OK - the area behind the passenger's head is not positioned well and is therefore uncomfortable but otherwise the seat is OK and there was just enough leg room. Most flights were in ageing planes but the personalised service made up for it. I found the attendants to be the real strength of this airline. I would definitely fly them again.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,4,yes

Singapore Airlines customer review,4,R Becker,13th October 2013,"SQ A380 SIN-SYD biz class. Young slightly disorganised flight crew (seats and entertainment systems we all like and know about) so this is about to very evident cost cutting by SIA as demonstrated by poor meal service offered. Had ordered Sushi via ""Book the Cook"" and as per inflight menu entree was a cold crab salad. 2 cold dishes that took well on 2 hours to get to my table for dinner. Sushi for biz class was rather disappointing but only until this experience was topped by the ""continental breakfast"": 2 slices each of papaya and pomelo accompanied by a small roll/danish pastry with butter and choice of jam tea or coffee - no second offering and plates couldn't be cleared fast enough.

Singapore Airlines customer review,10,Eduardo Steger,10th October 2013,Flew from LAX to Koh Samui via Narita and Singapore. Long flight in economy seating. Paid a little extra ($50/per seat) for leg space worth it for me. The staff on board were exemplary in their treatment of the guests and yes even in the economy seats I felt were treated well by the on board staff. Extremely polite I'm a nervous flyer and they made feel very confident in their abilities. I would definitely recommend this airline to anyone flying to Asia.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,8,G Wiseman,9th October 2013,From Adelaide to Singapore and return in A330-300 Singapore to London and return in A380. The A330 was reasonably new on the way up but an older rattler coming back. Also I don't understand when you leave Singapore at midnight why you only have a choice of three main dishes? After a few hours in the Silver Kris lounge all I wanted was a snack such as cheese & biscuits or a sandwich - with a glass of Bollinger to help send me to sleep! It's a less than 7-hour flight with a big tailwind so why over-cater? Both A380 flights were impeccable. Even smarter service going up than coming back. Wonderful to have a lie-flat and a hectare of room to sleep in and a functional wide- choice IFE. In my view Qantas made a big mistake dropping its QF81 service to Singapore in favour of going via Dubai. Hint: You need to think like passengers do not like a Qantas executive's dream.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,4,yes

Singapore to LHR on 777-300 ER instead of A380 but managed to get two seats together at the back of the plane. Food quality not great and they again ran out of my meal choice for breakfast.

The cabin and toilets were kept clean throughout the duration of the flight. The krisworld IFE was superb with a wide range of movies music and games. The 2 meals were delicious and probably the best I have tasted in the air. The cabin crew as always were exceptional serving the drinks frequently to keep us well hydrated. Will recommend this airline.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,1,S Cameron,7th October 2013,Arrived from London with my fiance. We bought tickets from their website and purchased preferred seats for an extra hundred dollars only to end up sitting in completely different sections of the plane. Our advance purchase had not been logged into their booking system. Our problem isn't that we couldn't sit next to each other but the way in which we were treated by the Singapore Airlines staff. One particular male check in staff blatantly displayed annoyance at us and showed no signs that he was willing to rectify the issue. We gave in and just decided to sit in whatever was assigned to us and after a promise of a refund for the preferred seating we were dismissively waved off. Started off badly on the ground and continued in the air when we were bypassed during meal service and one rude staff wasn't interested when we questioned her. A senior crew noticed this and was professional in trying to make up for it but by then we were fed up at the inadequacy and total lack of customer service.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,1,no
Singapore Airlines customer review,5,A Weera,1st October 2013,I have been travelling on SIA for last 12 years. I find the standard of service dropping every time I take the airline in the recent past. NZ to Singapore is a long trip. The service was really poor never got what was requested. Food was bad did not even bother to eat my final meal on the return trip to NZ. Some staff rude their standard of service was bias on the type of passenger. July trip was the worst airline experience I have had in my 20 years of airline travel. Very substandard service.

Singapore Airlines customer review,7,Wan Bin,26th September 2013,Singapore to Japan on a late night flight 11pm to 9am. I was surprised that the drinks service was reduced to being given a choice of juice water or beer from trays instead of the full drinks cart service. I got what I requested when I asked for it specifically. The menu card provided listed that a selection of snacks are available upon request before breakfast. When I asked what the options were the stewardess gave me a few pieces of tiny biscuits. On the way back the stewardess gave me the option of instant noodles or biscuits. I wonder if these are cost cutting measures. The new advertisements portrayed better service though hence I was disappointed. Air France and KLM offers a much better snack selection of chocolates fruits sandwiches cakes throughout their flight. The choice of entertainment options is great though.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,,4,yes

The cabin crew came around frequently during the flight with orange juice and water. Also snacks and chocolates were available on request from the galley! A good selection of films along with free headphones and a comfort pack of toothpaste toothbrush socks etc. The cabin crew were very welcoming and helpful with assisting passengers with finding seats and locating space for carry on luggage. Previously I have flown a lot with American Airlines and Iberia which do not come anywhere near to Singapore Airlines. I had forgotten that long haul travel in economy class could be so delightful! Singapore Airlines were wonderful.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes

Had 3 seats to myself which was nice. Seat was comfortable and not as hard as one would imagine. Drinks service begins once we took off and it came back on intervals throughout the duration of the flight time. Food was great and i went for both of the Japanese selection which was awesome. Krisworld was excellent too with lots of entertainment though it should be using touch screen by now. (Those who are transiting to Los Angeles will need to exit the plane transit through security and back in the gate). All these took 10 mins and with lots of help from the Japanese and Singapore crew.

The Kirsworld entertainment system is excellent! but not touchscreen and must be operated by a remote which seemed old to me. The food served on board this Singapore Airlines flight sector was great! I was served two meals and both tasted okay  no complains from me. The service standards from the FA is still as good as before! As this was a long haul flight toothbrushes and socks were given out to all the passengers including blankets and pillows. The FA's made lots of trips around serving water and OJ trying not to make the passengers dehydrated because of the flight. The FA's also forced all passengers to shut their window blinds to give passengers more rest as it was in the day.

Foods served on all flights were delicious. FA's were great and served with smiles on all segments of the flight. Upper deck of A380 is much more quieter and easier to sleep on long haul flights. Singapore airlines assigned four FA's on upper deck to serve 88 passengers which is very efficient to get meals served quicker. Frequently providing the drink run.

Singapore Airlines customer review,9,Nilesh Bartlett,8th September 2013,CMB-SIN-CGK-SIN-CMB. Outbound flight from Colombo was satisfactory. Crew were friendly and meals were in large quantities. Aircraft was well maintained. SIN-CGK - Crew were in competition with the timing but still met satisfactory standards. Return CGK-SIN flew the 777-300 left Jakarta at 1705 hrs and landed on time. Singapore- Colombo Main course was inedible and dressed with unnecessary oil. Crew were efficient but no smiles. Highly recommend the airline.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,3,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,10,Chris Ford,8th September 2013,SYD-SIN and SIN-LHR on A380s travelling as a couple with two children under 2. SQ remains our first choice after yet again making potentially challenging flights more than bearable. Having booked well in advance the airline blocked a window seat at the front of economy (row 31) to give us extra room for our toddler who was too big for the bassinet. Crew were patient and very accommodating providing milk on several occasions and even washing bottles for us. There was never a crossed word from them even when the toddler made one of his regular sprints through the galleys. I requested seafood meals at booking which were excellent. IFE was very good as always. Our double stroller was delivered promptly after landing to the jetway. I am more than happy to pay the extra money to fly SQ.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,5,J Jakoplic,8th September 2013,SIN to Zurich. Return Amsterdam to SIN. As usual when I fly on Singapore Airlines the food service is their strongest suit - excellent except for the wine which is closer to vinegar than alcohol. Seats are alright but not any more comfortable than on other airlines. IFE system awkward to use and earbuds uncomfortable. Their weakest point? Staff Service. Flight attendants polite but extremely robotic and not particularly friendly. They always seem to be reading from a script when talking to passengers. Crew on just about any other airline do a much better job of making customers feel welcome.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,,2,no
Singapore Airlines customer review,10,Wilson See,5th September 2013,SIN-SYD. It was a midnight flight staff tried their best to serve all passengers without disturbing their sleep. Staff were friendly and food was served in a prompt manner. Good range of inlight entertainment but it's the seats that allow you to have adequate rest even in economy class. Might not be the cheapest for a 5 star airlines but it's worth every single cent as they ensure that you get to your final destination safely and comfortably.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,10,Wilson See,5th September 2013,MEL-SIN on SQ 208. I felt A330 seats were more comfortable than the bigger aircraft A380. Food was superb and you will never go wrong with Krisworld - the inflight entertainment. Staff were attentive and there is no doubt that this is one of the top 5 star airlines in the world.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,10,Anne Phillips,3rd September 2013,My husband and I flew 28th July Tullamarine - Singapore SQ 238. 29th July Singapore - London SQ 318. 27th Aug London - Singapore SQ319 Singapore - Tullamarine SQ217. I have nothing but high praise for staff at all time. Attendants were attentive polite and helpful. Food was fine and plenty of it. We haven't travelled a lot but Singapore Airlines will be my choice of airline.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,9,Stephen Santoso,3rd September 2013,AMS-SIN-CGK. Flight was on time. Arrived at Singapore Changi airport on time nice airport for transit. Aircraft from AMS-SIN was refitted B777-200ER. which is quiet old but clean nice and comfortable (use 3x3x3 configuration). Staff on both flights were attentive they also offered drinks every several times. However the LCD screen for the entertainment is quite old so the resolution of the screen wasn't really clear.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,8,Eelco van den Heuvel,1st September 2013,FRA-JFK-FRA on A380. Outbound good service good food - especially the deserts - and hard working and friendly crew who gave plenty of drinks. Inbound good service again but bad food and ran out of choice. Both flights left bang on time and arrived early inbound even 45 mins earlier. Efficient boarding on big A380 which has fantastic IFE but not more legroom than any other plane or airline. Would have thought SQ give their flagship a more spectacular cabin design but no difference from other planes. All in all good experience for a reasonable price but not on par with e.g. Qatar Airways.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,9,K Lim,29th August 2013,Flew economy London to Kuala Lumpur via Singapore and back. Full flight on both long haul legs but staff were good - efficient attentive and constantly offering drinks. Queues for toilets were short quality of food good and lots of movies. Found the games not up to scratch and showing their age. Seat and legroom comfortable enough. Definitely the best carrier to the Far East. Stopover in Singapore airport good with lots to do.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,2,M Reason,28th August 2013,Sydney to Singapore 27th July 2013 SQ232 and returned 13th August 2013 on SQ211. Outbound flight was good on the A380. Attendants robotic but efficient nonetheless even though they took their time responding to request buttons. Seats aren't the worst but not the best. Recline was good seat pitch not so much. I enjoyed the meals on this flight especially the Western steak cooked perfectly. Nothing too troublesome. The return leg however was very disappointing on a tattered B777 aircraft. Seats were extremely uncomfortable with small recline and an industry standard 32 inch seat pitch. Crew were far less attentive than the first leg. It took different crew trying to ask for some basic toiletries or a glass of water. Seat back TV's were tiny and intermittently froze throughout the flights. Overall whilst the first flight was above average the return was far from acceptable.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,,2,no
Singapore Airlines customer review,8,Mindy Pang,26th August 2013,Took SQ's flight bound for Taipei a few weeks back. Brunch meal was served omelette with baked beans grilled chicken sausage and tomato - tasted decent but having baked beans on a 5-star airline just does not seem to fit the line. Service was great with crew readily available should you have any needs/queries. Flight journey was smooth too. Seats were rather comfortable with head rest. AVOD was up to date with interesting movies and games but the earphone is rather uncomfortable. Probably SQ should invest in noise-cancelling headphones for Y class passengers in futures. SQ is also family-friendly as there is a kids channel in AVOD and activities for kids such as coloring books.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,10,G Oram,19th August 2013,My wife and I flew 4 long haul flights from Melbourne to Frankfurt in June 2013. As both of us have had knee operations we asked for and they obliged us with adjacent seats so we could stretch our legs into aisles. Seats were comfortable enough for the long haul. Cabin staff were excellent in their duties. Seeing that my wife was using crutches at the time all staff offered assistance to her. This is our first experience with long haul flights and were very impressed without exception. The food was served hot and they catered to everyone's request. Drinks were served on a regular basis. I would recommend this airline to an one wishing to fly long haul. Inflight entertainment appeared to be up to date and there was a good choice of recent films to watch. Will certainly fly with them again without hesitation.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,7,B Borjes,19th August 2013,July 20th SIN-SFO via ICN. Return August 2 SFO-SIN via ICN. SA has always been rated very high for service but I think they are starting to cut corners. Their equipment still looks great seats are comfortable and inflight entertainment is great but the service is really slipping. I rang the call button 3 times during one flight as I desperately needed a soda but nobody ever came. The meals have definitely been shrinking in size and the kids meals are becoming more unusual. A kids meal should almost be generic like pizza or spaghetti but you rarely see those offered.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,10,Tercon Bojan,19th August 2013,Flying the SQ flagship A380 on the Frankfurt - NY route is a total joy. This is truly a premium airline with a top notch product and service. Although there is more competition these days in the premium airline category SQ truly brings back the romance of flying. Their superb service and product makes the premium price totally worth it. Of course now as I enter the US I have to prepare myself for flying the American carriers. They have a thing or two to learn about from SQ.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,8,Tercon Bojan,19th August 2013,SQ uses the refurbished 777-200ERs on the Singapore - Amsterdam route. Although this is the new business class seat the cabin is not quite the same as the new 777-300ER planes that have the same product. The main difference is in the IFE system. Masked as a new system it actually seems to be the old system built into the new seat. Thus the selection of movies and quality of display is lacking. For the rest it's up to the impeccable SQ standard. Unbelievable service terrific food and a great bed.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,4,E Santoso,18th August 2013,SUB-SIN with SIA in Economy Class. Flight was delayed by one hour due to late arrival from SIN. Once on board the crew distributed hot towels but not all passenger got it. Food was edible and the entertainment system worked well. The in-flight service was not so good some FA were just friendly whereas the others were not. A steward even raised his voice while asking my little boy to switch off his IPAD around 40 minutes before our arrival at the Changi Airport. All in all for the price I paid it was not what I expected from a 5 star airline.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,,2,no
Singapore Airlines customer review,10,R Sarkar,15th August 2013,Airbus A380 from LAX to Singapore with a stop at Tokyo-Narita. Excellent cockpit crew and cabin staff. Very attentive to the needs of the passengers. Ground staff at LAX and at Changi were very helpful courteous and friendly. Once the plane reaches cruising altitude it is practically quiet. We will always fly on SIA whenever our schedules allow. We go to Asia every 2 to 3 years and SIA is our first choice!,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,9,S Rawlings,14th August 2013,Flew MEL-SIN-IST business class. Really enjoyed the new MEL lounge which has a nice modern feel. The first leg was on the 777-300 with the regional business seat which was comfortable. The crew on this leg however were very robotic and just went through the motions. SIN-IST was on the refitted 777-200ER and the service and food was amazing. The crew could not do enough for us and insisted on making our beds. We used booked the cook on this leg and the food was of a very high quality. The seat on the refitted 777 have a few extra storage areas compared those seats on the A380 which I like. I do find the food in the Singapore lounge to be rather uninspiring considering Singapore itself is such a food orientated city. We will fly with SQ again.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,10,Athasit Arunthari,13th August 2013,New York to Singapore Via Frankfurt SQ25 August 1 A380. Airplane interior is showing its age. Inflight entertainment has a lot of movies and music to choose from and food in Economy Class is delicious. Snack between meals is good with sandwiches chips and fruits. Singapore to Bangkok SQ972 on August 3 was a Boeing 777-200. The seats in Economy Class are getting old. Singapore Airlines should fly the new Economy Seats to Bangkok or fly the Airbus 330-300. Overall the food and Entertainment in Economy Class is excellent.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,8,L Amelia,12th August 2013,Flew A380 Suites on SIN-HKG-SIN over the national day holidays. Excellent crew; very accommodating and attentive to needs. In-flight entertainment was giving me issues on the leg home but was promptly resolved after I brought it to the crew's attention. Great seat width and food was good despite not having booked the cook in advance. Otherwise a great flight but avoid the 4th rows where possible as it is near the pantry so it tends to be noisy.,,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,9,R Douglass,11th August 2013,SYD-SIN-BKK-SIN-SYD on a combination of A380 / A330 / 777-200 (2class)/ 777-300ER. Was very happy with every aspect of every flight (except the 1.5hr delay on the last leg). The seats were comfortable on each flight and the catering was superb. I suggest you 'book the cook' and select your exact meal before flying as it was very good. IFE was great on all flights as was the service standards.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,3,H Poulos,7th August 2013,Sydney to Singapore last month on 12th and returned 4th August. Inflight experience was alright and staff were generally good some not so much. Food was shoddy on both flights and ended up leaving most of it. Entertainment choices are probably the best out there but the operating system is old and deteriorating. Both flights were on time. Overall it was pretty ordinary and probably better off flying cheaper and spending more in Singapore.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,,2,no
Singapore Airlines customer review,10,Joanne Marce Pereira,7th August 2013,SQ478 to Johannesburg on 18 June 2013 and returned on SQ479 (departing Johannesburg 20 June). Flight scheduled to leave Singapore around 1am and due to some aircraft problems after boarding we had to return to the terminal and wait for a new aircraft. Flight resumed close to 7am. SIA arranged for refreshments immediately as well as pillows and blankets for our wait at the new boarding gate. My biggest compliment is the crew. The same crew served us on the flight back.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,5,yes

I have friends that are flying Qatar to Singapore because of better aircraft's. I fly business class to Singapore every 6 months and I am seriously thinking of changing airlines or fly to Singapore via London to fly the A380.

Singapore Airlines customer review,9,Stephen Reeds,6th August 2013,Travelled for the first time with Singapore to New Zealand a very long trip. The cabin staff were excellent friendly helpful always ready to have a laugh. The food by and large was fine especially for Economy and the choice of Inflight entertainment was very good. The crew made what could have been a grisly experience into an enjoyable one. Seats were fairly cramped in economy.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,5,yes

Singapore Airlines customer review,9,B Redinger,4th August 2013,Used SQ for our trip to Vietnam. Lived up to their reputation on all 4 flights. A380 on the 2 longer sectors which was a comfortable journey and found seats and legroom both ok. Older B777/200 on shorter flights which are showing some age but are very well maintained. Food was plentiful and actually quite nice for airline food. Plenty to drink and regular drink runs carried out. IFE had plenty of variety to keep us amused. Crew members polite and friendly. A little more expensive than some other carriers but well worth it for the little extra we paid. Overall would recommend and will always be our first option providing price is reasonable.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,1,P Black,31st July 2013,Business Class Sydney - Singapore - Delhi / Mumbai - Singapore - Brisbane. Sydney to Singapore was the only leg which had the newer style business class seats (which are good) although in seat power was not working for the entire duration of the flight. Each of the other legs were on dated planes with the older style business seats (not so great). Of particular concern was the Singapore - Brisbane flight where the seat and its surrounds were visibly dirty. My biggest gripe was the Mumbai - Singapore night time flight. Upon boarding the crew handed out menus and asked if I wanted to be disturbed to eat dinner - which I did after the atrocious Mumbai lounge experience (standing room only). Sure enough I fall asleep and wake up when tables are being set for dinner - I request my meal only to be told that they hadn't heated anything for me so I would just have to wait until after they had served everyone else. No offer of a drink or anything from the crew. Being a late night flight the idea of starting dinner 45 minutes after everyone else was not good. I ended up having to ask the crew to give me a bread roll and that the only food I got! Will never fly again.,,,Business Class,,,3.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,,2,no
Singapore Airlines customer review,7,A Shatten,28th July 2013,"We flew on 4 long-haul legs in June and July business class. Service was friendly and efficient throughout. The meals were well-considered: light dishes were available for every meal plenty to eat and drink. The seats however were not to our satisfaction. There's heaps of room but the back of the seat is straight and the headrest pushes your head forward. The recline angle is small and the adjustable footrest is useless. There is a footstool but I am 173cm tall (5' 8"") and it was too far away for me to use comfortably. So I spent much of the time trying to find a comfortable sitting position. The seat converts to a flat bed and in this position it is fine for sleeping. SIA uses other airlines' lounges in many airports. I hope they don't use United again because their lounge in Melbourne hasn't been updated since discos were fashionable. (SIA's lounge in MEL was being renovated).",,,Business Class,,,2.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,5,S Fletcher,24th July 2013,LHR-SIN and return on A380. Flight from LHR was on time and all expected services on board. Economy seat in the main cabin on this leg of the flight was reasonable but a little cramped when compared to other airlines. Meal and beverage service was ok but ran out of choice for meal. Entertainment service was excellent. On the return leg with seat in upper deck felt slightly less cramped but seats not the most comfortable for long haul flight. Meal and beverage service was good. Entertainment system was ok programming constantly jerked and froze but was viewable. The disappointment with the flights was the baggage allowance which was small at 20kg when compared with other airlines which offer 32kg.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,9,Dalton Steve,24th July 2013,Recent return Perth - Singapore - (Munich) - Manchester economy.

The 777's are showing age somewhat.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,7,Daniel Harrison,24th July 2013,Third time I have flown Singapore Airlines from Heathrow Intl to Changi Intl. My overall experience with them has always been satisfactory or above however there are a few issues. The appearance of the cabin is exceptional. Pleasant settings with artwork and during the festive season decorations above windows. I find the seats to be quite comfortable and have plenty of leg space in front of me. Staff are happy to help and are very pleasant. Now the negatives: I find compared with Qantas the in flight entertainment system to be limited. Generally there isn't a great deal of movies to choose from and the TV series they offer are rarely complete series only offering a few episodes. The food isn't that great if you're not a fan of eastern cuisine just wish they would offer a western option every now and then. Overall I would say its a close call between Qantas and SQ for economy and would say Qantas has the edge.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,3,Charles Kennedy,22nd July 2013,"LHR-SIN. I couldn't book the open-jaw route I wanted on SQ's awful website so booked it as a codeshare with Virgin Atlantic which made online check-in impossible - VS site said the operating airline was someone else and SQ said the booking had been made through a different airline. I phoned VS and they were worse than useless SQ at least sympathised and the gent I spoke to said he would send a message to LHR requesting the seat I was hoping for. I was one of the last to check-in and indeed a window on the left had been saved for me so kudos for that. Boarding was OK although the cabin crew in my area didn't speak much English which complicated some pax requests for reseating. First meal service was OK lots of movies but not many good ones seat comfortable and managed some sleep. One reason I booked SQ was to enjoy an Asian style breakfast so you can imagine my frustration that despite distributing a lavish eight page printed menu to economy passengers which included three breakfast options (including a tasty-sounding pork and noodles exactly what I'd had in mind) they were only able to offer ""chicken sausage with frittata"" which was as disgusting as it sounds. Arrived on time and customs and baggage claim was pretty quick. Beyond being deposited at the destination safely and on time SQ fell short of expectations. Will not go out of my way to fly them again.",,,Economy Class,,,4.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,,1,no
Singapore Airlines customer review,3,Stephen Yates,22nd July 2013,SQ232 30 JUNE SYD - SINGAPORE SQ366 1ST JULY SINGAPORE - ROME. Economy was ordinary on my flight Sydney to Rome.

Singapore Airlines customer review,9,W Coulton,22nd July 2013,Perth-Singapore-Perth in economy on refitted regional 777-200. Aircraft interior in excellent condition. Legroom was quite acceptable for what is only a 5+ hour flight. Flights in each direction were a breakfast time departure and we found the food to be very good with both the Western and Asian selections filling and tasty. Flights pretty much ran to time on departure and both arrived early. The onboard service was excellent on both flights with genuine smiles and attention. Just like the SQ of old. Happy to fly with them again.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5,yes

Nice and quiet for sleeping upstairs too. Hadn't flown SQ in 7yrs nothing different. Same solid airline that understands what good service is and how to deliver it.

Singapore Airlines customer review,9,V Naidoo,17th July 2013,BCN to SIN (SQ 377) and SIN to BNE (SQ 235) on the B777-300ER and A330-300 respectively. Both flights were consistent in terms of food quality seat comfort and service. All of which were exceptional especially when compared to other leading airlines. The IFE was also commendable - updated with the latest movies and very user friendly.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,8,Sue Carter,15th July 2013,MEL-SIN return. Usually travel Business Class but tried Economy on this short trip. Overall impression was pretty good. Both flights were almost full but the crews were friendly and helpful and food service was quite slow but quality of the food was reasonable. Had a strange experience with the inflight entertainment system on both flights an English Language film suddenly lapsed into a version dubbed into some oriental language. Eventually reset by repeated switches out of the video system. Selection of films etc was OK but not comparable to Emirates product. One criticism is that the IFE was switched off 40 minutes before landing on the Singapore leg (A380). On the return trip it was switched off 20 minutes before landing. Seems ungenerous and not my experience on other airlines. A FA on the Melbourne flight also asked me to remove my noise-cancelling headphones for landing - also a new experience! Online check-in was difficult because of website problems but managed it in the end and subsequent check-in at Melbourne was very quick. Unable to check-in online for return trip due to more website problems but the standard check-in system at Changi was just excellent. Better than some Business Class check-in processes in fact.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,9,V Naidoo,15th July 2013,BCN to SIN (SQ 377) on 14 July 2013. Flight was excellent from the food to the IFE to the flight attendants.

Singapore Airlines customer review,10,D Bardens,14th July 2013,FRA to JFK and back. I am a frequent traveller and have been on more than 25 airlines so far. But Singapore airlines always exceeds my expectations! They serve food in economy that could easily be served in business classes of other carriers. The entertainment system is just great and the legroom is good. The great attitude of the friendly crews gives you the feeling that you are welcome onboard and that it is a pleasure for them to make you feel comfortable. This was my second time on Singapore Airlines and definitely not the last one!,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,10,Peter Britain,14th July 2013,FRA-SIN and SIN-MEL in first. Excellent crews on both legs.

Singapore Airlines customer review,9,R Mortimer,14th July 2013,LHR-SIN SIN-MEL. Great service from start to finish. The crew on the first leg were the most friendly and cheerful I've had on a flight even on a full flight and through very uncomfortable turbulence. The seats were good a little painful after 13 hours but the leg room (which is usually a major discomfort for me) was good for economy. Food was good not great but better than most. As with all airlines they need to make money but at least with Singapore Airlines you feel like a human being rather than cattle. Plus Changi airport is excellent which makes SA even more of a no brainier decision.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,4,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,9,Ganesh Kumar,14th July 2013,SQ 407/408 DEL-SIN-DEL on B700. On time push back both flights early arrival in both destinations.

All flights on time or early Seating reservations honoured AVOD fully operational on all sectors albeit the systems more responsive on the A333 than the 77W. Seats are perfectly fine for Y. Food was plentiful and tasty as were the drinks in both alcoholic and non alcoholic varieties. All crews pleasant and addressed us by name and baggage showed up. There were only two issues meal choices ran out on MUC-SIN and suitable alternative wasn't offered. Secondly had we been advised you were not allowed off the plane on the SIN-MUC-MAN leg in MUC we would have travelled via LHR turned a 12 hour leg into a 15 hour ordeal.

Singapore Airlines customer review,9,Savi Mull,5th July 2013,DEL-SIN-MNL-SIN-DEL. Flights from Delhi on the retrofitted 777-300s and to Manila on the new A333s. Check in was a breeze at each airport. Boarding was in row sequence starting from the back of the plane and very orderly. Was on window seats all through out and happy to be able to select seats at the time of booking. Night flight from DEL- SIN was a red eye meals served not too quickly after take off. Service excellent and warm on all legs. Crew could not do enough and responded promptly to anything requested. White wine in economy class is stellar. Food was fine and could be better. I had selected vegetarian oriental meals which were light and flavourful. One of the Asian veg meals I had weren't as good. Seats have a generous width and seat pitch. Seats seemed even better on the A330 since they are the newer economy class seat leg rests are a huge welcome to tired feet. AVOD was great on the A330s but not as much on the 777-300s. The announcements from the cockpit were well timed and regular keeping us informed of all delays and weather conditions. Top notch and will recommend.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,10,K Elliott,3rd July 2013,LHR-SIN on 777 excellent service as usual good choice of entertainment and food was very good and despite the slight delay in boarding we were still able to leave on time and reached SIN an hour early. Return leg was on an A380 and was excellent once again. Crew was friendly and helpful and will continue to use SIA on my yearly trips to Singapore.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes

Singapore Airlines customer review,9,Shiroman Singh,28th June 2013,SFO-ICN (refuelling stop) - SIN-DEL route. The service was excellent. The air hostesses always had a smile on their faces and were very patient and kind. The inflight entertainment was very good too. There was a large selection of movies TV shows and music to watch and listen to. The food was so-so. I did like the deserts but I didn't particularly enjoy the dinner. Our plane was a Boeing 777-300ER from SFO-SIN. It was very clean and the seats and everything were comfortable. Our plane from SIN-DEL was a Boeing 777-200ER an older plane but still the cabin was clean and tidy. Overall a great experience and one I would definitely recommend again.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,10,R Hogan,28th June 2013,SYD-PEK return via SIN in Y class. 3 legs in 777 and one in A380. One of the 777 legs (SYD-SIN) in older 772 and 2 legs (SIN-PEK and return) in refurbed 773. A380 and 773 product very similar and absolutely exceptional. Very good AVOD with plenty of selection of movies and TV and service second to none. Older 772 looking tired but none the less one of the best services ex Australia. Highly recommended for the price. J lounge in SYD disappointingly small.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
Singapore Airlines customer review,6,S Rostron,25th June 2013,SIN-MEL on 777. Chose largely because of the schedule which is good for this route and price which wasn't the cheapest but allowed me to get full Star Alliance points. The lounge in Singapore for Gold Star Alliance is very busy and a bit tired. Was sat at the back of the plane and the main complaint was that it was unbearably hot. Was told that it would cool down after takeoff it did but took a while and in any case the cabin was still uncomfortable warm for the entire flight. This seems to be a theme with all the Singapore Airlines night flights just too hot and uncomfortable in the cabins on overnight flights. The seats are not very comfortable either very hard after a while and the IFE screens were old and looked a bit fuzzy. Toilets were ok and the food was pretty average. The standout was the crew who were very good and provided an excellent service. They are let down by the physical product though and the warm cabins. It's easy for someone to use a blanket in a cool cabin not so easy for those of us who are overheating to escape from that.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,,4,yes
