"""only if we had been on higher fare class""",5,J Shearer,26th July 2019,"✅ Trip Verified |  This flight from Shenzhen to Brisbane was the last of four flights we took with Hainan Airlines on our round trip from Australia to China. The first three flights were all in Economy class. While the flights were all fairly good, we didn’t feel the food and service to be quite up to the standard of other carriers that we’ve used. But our main issue was that after we had boarded and were seated in Economy prior to departure on the Shenzhen to Brisbane flight, which was a night flight, there was an announcement asking any passengers who wished to upgrade to Business class to contact one of the flight attendants. As we were both fairly tired and the Economy section of the airplane was almost full, we thought we might treat ourselves to an upgrade if the cost was reasonable. So I approached one of the flight attendants to find out what the cost of upgrading would be, and she asked to see our boarding passes to check what our fare class was. After a short while, she came back with one of her colleagues and said that it would cost 5,000 CNY (Chinese Yuan) each to upgrade. Just to make sure that there was no misunderstanding, I wrote down “10,000 ¥” on a piece of paper and asked them if that was the total cost for my wife and myself and they said “Yes.” So we decided to go ahead with the upgrade and we were moved to Business class which was less than half full. However, when we were about to pay by credit card we were told that the cost of upgrading would be 6,800 CNY each. When we told them we had been quoted 5,000 CNY each before we moved, they said that would have only been the case if we had been on a higher fare class. In other words, we had been given incorrect information earlier, but the flight attendants were not prepared to say that someone had made a mistake. At that stage, the flight was about to take off and we didn’t particularly feel like going all the way back to our original seats so we decided to stay in Business class, pay the full amount and to make a complaint to the airline when we got back to Australia. Business class was very comfortable and we both slept well on the way to Brisbane. Also, the flight attendant who was looking after us was very attentive to our needs. After we arrived back home we emailed Hainan Airlines asking for a refund of 3,600 CNY. They apologized for their mistake but refused to provide any compensation.  I’m rating our flight experience at only 5 out of 10, primarily because of the way we were misled.",A330-200,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Shenzhen to Brisbane,June 2019,4.0,4.0,3.0,,3.0,1,no

Also offered me amenity kit with slippers, etc.  The entertainment system is loaded with my favorite movie. Also, the food is and might always be one of the best you can find in the sky.

"""What a great experience""",10,Changjie Wu,24th April 2019,"✅ Trip Verified |  Beijing to Toronto. What a great experience to take the flight with Hainan Airlines because of the unforgettable assistance we got from Hainan Airlines staff at Beijing Airport! I was bringing my mother-in-law to Canada. However, after we checked in and went through the check point, my mom was notified that her passport was cancelled in 2014 for unknown reason. So she could not fly with me. We were completely lost as we had no idea what had happened. My mom was very sure that this must be a mistake. As all my other family members were 1600 KMS away, I was not sure what I could do -rescheduling my flight to stay with my mom means I have to cancelled a few important meetings, while having my mom flying back to my hometown by herself means I needs to take a big risk - she was over 75 years old and she was already very tired and frustrated. I contacted Hainan Airline in Beijing airport, hoping she could give me some advice. After I briefly explained the situation, staff calmed us down and said she would be very glad to offer assistance. Just after a few minutes, they rushed to the border check point and promised that she would take care of my mom, making sure she could fly back to my hometown smoothly with wheelchair service provided. With her promise that I had faith in, I continued my flight as planned. Luckily, the passport issuing office found the mistake and issued a new one to my mom within 24 hours. The next day, staff spent hours following up my mom's flight arrangement, including pre-booking a premium seat without charging extra fee, having her colleague take care of the luggage, and advising both Beijing and Toronto to provide wheelchair service so my mom would not get lost. Eventually my mom arrived at Toronto safely. My whole family were deeply moved by Hainan Airlines staff.

IFC just okay not much of a selection compared to BOAC, AF, or AA. The reason for the average score though is that this company does not transfer your bags from one of their flights to your connexion flight. You have to collect your bag in China, face a surly immigration official, pass your bag through an x-ray machine upon arrival, then drag it far away and upstairs and check-in a second time to get your connexion boarding pass and to reconsign your luggage. Also, if your connexion doesn't depart within three hours you have to cool your heels in the check-in lobby and sit with your luggage. That is a colossal inconvenience and when you're a man of my age (56) it is difficult. Also, Hainan AIrlines doesn't seem to have the right to use any of the gates at any of the Chinese terminals (or LAX for that matter) so plan on being bussed all over the airports.

Many frequent flyers have harsh criticism of Chinese airlines, but my flights with two of them (China Southern and Hainan) were both exceptional experiences and the equal to that of the more well known and appreciated carriers such as Singapore or Cathay Pacific. The onboard service on my Hainan flight to Beijing was outstanding. The purser made a point of introducing himself to each business class passenger, and henceforth addressed each of us by our names. The meals and wine list were of the highest quality. The bathrooms were kept spotless throughout the 12 hour trip and were provided with a range of creams and colognes, but strangely, no soap. Hainan arranges the business class cabin on some of its 787's in a 1-2-1 herringbone pattern. These seats are great for comfort and privacy, but for passengers who enjoy sightseeing during the flight, the window seats are at a distance from the window itself, and seeing out is a challenge.

Selection of ""quick dinner"" is a very good idea, however, dinner was served more than 1.5 hours after takeoff (which was delayed because of snow), which meant service started at 4.00 am (Chinese time). Quick dinner is composed by starter, main and cheese/dessert, which is not so quick at the end of the day. Food is quite tasty. Selection of wines very poor. Seat is very comfortable and private.

Hainan Airline is one of the best Chinese airlines in my opinion because of their great service quality. In SJC airport, they had enough staff so there was only a very short line to check bags. As a frequent flyer, I got access to their VIP lounge. It was a bit overcrowded since it is the only lounge at SJC. The food and drink were limited in the lounge but luckily there are enough plugins close to almost every seat. Boarding was well-organized given this B787 was full that day. On the flight, the flight attendant serve with a smile. There were two meals served on board; both of them were unsatisfying, which is pretty common among all airlines I have taken. For Hainan Airline, I think their food quality is too ‘stable’ – they have not improved for several years. The movies in the entertainment system are quite old, and so is the music. However, none of these problems affected my good mood, because the flight attendants were so nice. The only thing for them to improve is that they turned on the cabin light too early before landing. If they could serve food faster, I could have a longer time to rest.

Some crew have poor English skills which you may say isn't a shock as its a Chinese airline but if they want to cater for the UK markets then they need to provide a service in the language they fly too. I have flown to Italy with them as well and there were Italian speaking staff on the flight and it was easier to speak Italian for me than English at times. We will continue to use Hainan as it flies where we want to although the domestic flight to connect to the International one going back to Europe is generally late, there is not enough time to transfer terminals and whilst I have not missed a connection my family have had bags miss and we know of several other passengers who don't connect so in winter this is a problem as there is no daily service, in summer it's a 24 hour delay at best.",,Business,Business Class,Manchester to Shanghai via Beijing,November 2017,4.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,5,yes

I had delays on both outbound and inbound journeys which totaled 52 hours in delays which I believe is unacceptable. While I got a good price, the information was very poor. When I checked into Bangkok airport I was notified of a 3 hour delay. This turned into a 6 hour delay and eventually an 8 hour delay (we were initially suppose to leave at 1:40am and took off at 10am). As there we no Hainan Airlines ground staff at the airport until 6am I had to call China to get updates. When ground staff turned up at the gate at 6am they gave us a small snack box as compensation. At Beijing Airport we were told we had missed our connection and told to go and collect our luggage with little guidance from the ground staff. We asked Hainan to be put us on another airline but we told that was not possible and we would have to wait 24 hours until our next flight (we missed our connection by 30 minutes and they didn't hold the flight). I  asked if I could push my return trip back by one day but I was told that this was not possible. The Beijing Airport hotel we were put up in was in poor condition (my hotel room has a wall covered in mold) and the food at the hotel was inedible. On returning to Beijing Airport we found out that we had another 3 hour delay to our flight. No compensation was provided for this delay. When we did finally board the aircraft we waited on the tarmac for an additional 2 hours (supposedly for weather delays).  When I arrived at Toronto  airport I was told there would be a 1 hour delay (which turned into a 2 hour delay).  Arriving into Beijing I was told that I had missed my connecting flight and I would need to wait another 24 hours for the next flight.

Ground service and check in was very slow at Sydney airport. I was unable to have my frequent flyer number added to my record as the agents were not familiar on the process.

"""got a reply 45 days after my original email""",1,Rob Munro,23rd September 2017,"✅ Verified Review |  Chengdu to Manchester via Beijing. 1st leg from Chengdu to Beijing was delayed. No information at Chengdu Airport about when my flight was likely to arrive. It was only after it became impossible to catch my connecting flight from Beijing that I received information about the delay, by which time it was pointless. Apparently the reason for the delay was bad weather. When I arrived at Beijing airport, the lady at the Hainan desk was unhelpful and rude. The best they could do for me was to wait 23 hours for my next flight, which was to Brussels and then a flight from Brussels to Manchester. The revised 2nd leg of journey from Beijing to Brussels was delayed by 5 hours, which meant my connecting flight from Brussels to Manchester would be missed too. Hainan Staff at Beijing Airport did not want me to go on the Beijing to Brussels flight with a suggestion that I should wait for another 20 or so hours to get another flight. I never found out where that flight was going because I made it very clear I was going to Brussels regardless and if I then had to fget myself home from there, I would do it. Apparently the reason for the second delay to my flight was bad weather again. After I arrived at Brussels, I had to wait about another 8 hours to get the next flight to Manchester. Soon after my return to Manchester, with my wife being Chinese I asked her to call Hainan offices based in China to ask for Hainan's official delay confirmation so that I could make a claim for the delay against my travel insurance. However, day after day the phone went unanswered, so I emailed their Manchester offices on 19th July giving all my flight details and asking the same thing. I received an automated reply to my email acknowledging my email and that it would be attended to. After it became obvious that I wasn't getting any response to my email, I called their offices at Manchester after having similar difficulties in getting anyone to speak to. Eventually I got through and the lady assured me my case was being dealt with and mentioned that Hainan head office in China had been contacted regarding compensation for my delay. This I found strange because all I had requested was confirmation of the delay, but if they wanted to do that it was fine by me. After nothing forthcoming was received after my call, I emailed them again & eventually got a reply 45 days after my original email. By the time I received Hainan's delay confirmation, the period for submitting it to my insurance company had expired. Upon challenging Hainan Airlines about this latest development, they said it's because I didn't keep emailing reminders to them and because I didn't also send copies of my tickets (which I was never asked for).",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Chengdu to Manchester via Beijing,June 2017,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,3,no

When the time came, we were called to board the plane and were escorted by a lounge attendant to the front of the queue and lead directly to a private vehicle to take us across the tarmac to where the plane was waiting at a remote stand, avoiding the bus ferrying other passengers. Nice touch. The plane was a standard Boeing 737-800, not old, not new. There were 8 seats in the business class section and we were the only passengers in that cabin. The seats were generously spaced with plenty of legroom (I'm 6'5). The service on board was friendly and efficient. Food service was good, the quality of food was good but not great.

A fellow passenger was pretty annoyed by that, but for me it wasn't a big deal. The problems started to come up at the security. Ground staff were very rude and checked the kids roughly with no smile, which scared them a bit. Arriving at the gate, we handed over our boarding passes, but we were told the seats had been changed.

Food from PEK is also good enough for economy class. I recommend oriental food instead of western when taking this flight. By the way, the crew prepared many types of drinks and snacks in the bar at the back of the cabin, during cruise. One thing I do not like is the aircraft. 787 was quiet enough but when it is fully packed with passengers, the economy class was so crowded. I enjoyed this trip. On the return the cabin crew chatted extremely loud in the back of the cabin and use the PA system to broadcast advertisements and selling goods in such a loud volume when people are planning to have a sleep.

They wanted us to take a flight 5 days later to Vancouver, and didn't want to pay the 80 dollars per day asked by China for overstaying in the country.  We paid a price to get from one place to another. Beijing Capital Airlines should care take of their customers.

My only slight con from the experience was that the cabin wifi was barely usable -I imagine the speed would only be useful for things like messaging.

"""both flights lovely""",8,M Edwards,16th November 2016,"✅ Verified Review | Taipei to Moscow via Beijing (and back the same way) with Hainan Airlines. Outward bound: both flights lovely, with decent hot food and friendly staff that spoke very good English. Both flights also left exactly on time, which is something that hasn't happened to me for years - not even a 10-minute delay when preparing for takeoff. I was planning on sleeping in the airport for my connection, but a Hainan representative met us off the plane and took us to our free accommodation nearby the airport, which was a nice surprise. The hotel itself wasn't fantastic - stains on carpets, strange smell in the room - but the bed was incredibly comfortable (picture attached), so I was happy. No breakfast provided. The Beijing-Moscow flight was almost empty, and I enjoyed having an empty seat next to me. A slightly strange thing was that 2 hours before landing the crew provided more food, but this was just the hot portion of the regular meal served without a tray, which left a bit of a mess on the table and was uncomfortable to handle. However, no other complaints. The return journey: we had a delay of around 2 hours in Moscow, but we were informed of this at check-in. This flight was full, but again, the service was very good. The transit hotel was far nicer this time - I didn't even go out to see Beijing this time around, just slept in it very happily. No complaints about any of the airports, except a note: in Moscow, non-Russian speakers are rare, and sometimes the security staff will yell at you in Russian, which can be confusing. Only one negative about the flight: the entertainment system on the A330 was difficult to work at times, and it seemed a bit old (for example, the flight path seemed to continue on to Spain, for some reason). One final note: Chinese airlines do not allow you to use your phone in-flight at all, even if it's in airplane mode (iPads are ok). I was surprised when a crew member told me to turn it off, because usually I just listen to music on my phone and try to sleep, but this was only a small issue and overall I enjoyed my trip.",Boeing 737-800 / A330-300,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,TPE to SVO via PEK,November 2016,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5,yes

Regardless, they leave you a bottle of water, crackers and nuts inside your seat pocket.

"""attendants very pleasant and helpful""",7,M Thales,19th July 2016,"✅ Verified Review |  Prior to booking this flight, I'd never heard of Hainan Airlines, however their introductory fare from Manchester to Beijing was cheap compared with others at the time, I went ahead and booked it. You cannot check in online and it must be done in person. This oddly ended up being a positive for me, as it enabled me to get exit row seats with a large amount of legroom on both MAN-PEK flights (row 48). The boarding was at best a bit of a scrum for economy. Business class had a separate queue which worked well. That said, the aircraft departed on time, so although it was the least relaxed boarding experience at least it worked. Hainan Airlines operate brand new A330s on this route, they're pretty darn clean. Seats for economy are good. Whilst getting comfy in economy on a 10+ hour long flight is never easy I'd argue they're on par with KLM/Air France. A thin blanket and very thin pillow is included, bring your own if possible. The in flight entertainment is okay with a selection of Western and Chinese content in equal proportions. No wifi, no USB power and the power outlets in the exit row seats didn't work.  The food was okay with a mixture of Chinese/Western dishes. Officially, you're not allowed to use your own electronic devices on board, on the first flight that wasn't an issue and I used my laptop and flight-mode phone with no issues, returning from Beijing to Manchester I was told off. Maybe bring a book as a backup. I noticed the flight attendants had a range of language flags on their name tags, English proficiency was mixed but overall good. They're all very pleasant and helpful though, the best I've experienced in a while! Transiting with Hainan for Hong Kong flights route, I flew Hong Kong Airlines on the PEK-HKG routes. Hong Kong Airlines is also part of the HNA Group and it shows, the aircraft are pretty much identical aside from the flight attendants uniforms and a different IFE skin. Transiting through Beijing was not a fun experience. Hainan operate out of terminal 2 which doesn't seem to be fully equipped as a transit point. Finding the transit area was difficult and it was poorly managed. Ground staff at Beijing were not exactly helpful in directing/helping transiting passengers. If anyone is concerned about the transit in Beijing, follow signs towards 'arrivals', once you find a moving walkway look right and there should be a glass-box-room thing for transit. It's not very clear, but that's where you'll need to go. Once you find it, it's pretty simple to be fair. 2 of the 4 flights were delayed, I had to be shifted onto a different HKG-PEK flight to meet my connection (which they were very helpful with) however the trip back to Manchester was stressful. As a solo leisure traveller this was an annoyance that was resolved, however for more critical trips I'd be wary if transiting through Beijing. Overall thoughts I bought my flight for £450 rtn whilst at the time Cathay Pacific was priced around the £700 mark, similar length connection flights with KLM and Lufthansa at £600. For the price I paid, it was remarkable value for money.",A330-300,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,MAN to HKG via PEK,July 2016,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,5,yes

Checked pricing on a business ticket and found then $3000 cheaper than others, so a bit skeptical, further read with interest some of the postings from others, as well as the time to complete transfers in Beijing - nonetheless felt adventurous and booked. Called to reserve 2 aisle seats. No problem. Agent spoke English well and confirmed seats on all legs. Arrived at O'Hare at 1330 for a 1520 departure. Check in was swift and painless. Lounge passes issued to Swissport Lounge. Lounge was adequate, but hard to locate. It is a right turn after security and a good walk. It is on the right and easy to miss. Boarding gate was at the opposite end of terminal 5. Boarding went smoothly, found our seats, stowed our carry on bags. The Boeing 787 does not have middle overhead bins. Greeted warmly by the inflight manager, as well as our flight attendant. English language skills were fine. Departed on time. Welcome drinks non-alcoholic offered.  Pillows, duvet and pj's handed out, as well as Bose noise cancelling head phones. Menus handed out. Orders taken and we were off. Service started quickly. Appetizers and ordered beverage arrived before you knew it. Soup and salad were at your table when your appetizer was finished. Main course selection of 5 items with accompaniments. They also served individualized bread baskets - tasty and ample. Refreshments were always available for top off. After dinner drinks offered, as well as 4 choices of dessert and or fruit and cheese platter. Actually, there was enough where you could have whatever you liked. Fully lie flat seat was comfortable, but not built for us 6' tall folks, but able to sleep without issue. The IFE was also ample for the 12 hour flight. Some old, some new movies, screen size was fine. Pre arrival meal had 4 choices. Served quickly again great portions. Throughout the flight the FA's were readily available and continued to ask if they could get you anything. Landed early, but to a remote area. Thus the infamous bus to the terminal. Dreaded the wait for the international transfer to Hong Kong. Same terminal as the arrival. Bus for biz class arrived quickly and attendants had signs with passengers names to assist them. We were guided to the transfer desk, security check and the pointed to the next departure gate. All done in 20 mins. Very classy. On the return it was a complete duplicate.

It was an excellent experience comparable to the best business classes I have tried. First of all,  a great deal with Business Class rates that are lower than some Premium Economy fares, the comfort of the seats is remarkable although I preferred the “old” style business seats to the new individual arrangements that could feel a little cramped. Most of all, I appreciated the kindness of the staff. As an example, I arrived 6 hours before my flight to Paris at Xi’an airport. Hainan counters were closed.

"""I would recommend Hainan Airlines""",9,F Alex,24th March 2016,"✅ Verified Review |  My family had a great trip on Hainan Airlines from Boston to Shanghai Pudong. Thrilled that they introduced this non-stop flight saving hours on the total journey to China. I really enjoyed and prefer the Boeing 787 compared to the 777-300ER. Fast Boarding/deplaning  since the plane is much smaller than the 777-300ER, especially the number of economy seats (only 177 on Hainan compared with say Emirates long haul 777-300 ER at 304). The larger windows and what appeared to be more efficient overhead bins/higher curved ceilings made the cabin feel more open and less claustrophobic. The 3x3x3 seating while not ideal is much better than a 3x4x3 on the 777-300 for long haul. I paid $750 roundtrip, I found the seats pretty comfortable with enough legroom. The economy seat actually reclined pretty far back. Which makes it a bit difficult when the passenger in front has reclined, but nonetheless easier for sleeping. I think the 787 seats are a bit shorter as well, so there is an adjustment to pull the headrest up if you are taller. Cabin crew for the most part were extremely helpful. However, I felt they were a bit more amateur than some airlines, possibly because they were generally on the younger side. Agreed with some other comments about the lack of English, but didn't find this a problem. They cleaned the bathrooms regularly throughout the flight. I thought the food generally was pretty good. I love that they give the option to pre-select a low calorie or fruit platter option for no cost. In addition, they set up a little spread in the back of the plane with all sorts of beverages and snacks so one could help themselves at any time. They came around plenty of times with water and tea. Ask for ""Bing Shui"" or ice water because typically the Chinese prefer water hot. I thought the inflight entertainment was lacking a bit. The TV options and movies while plentiful fell a bit short of other 5 star airlines. The touch screen was also a bit unresponsive and slow. Overall I would recommend Hainan Airlines especially for service to mainland China. They are expanding quickly to unique destinations. I loved the 787 and believe it is a great option for long haul.

I'm not a big fan of the side by side configuration of business class seats - prefer the solo (1x2x1) seats Hainan Airlines has on other aircraft.

The 787 is fairly new and well-decorated, red wall paper and carpet give cabin ambient a warm touch, seat room looks quite compact at the first glance but as a 6.2’’ tall 195lbs big man I can fit in pretty well yet had a sound sleep after. Two economy meals were palatable, decent and Asian/western fusion style compared other trans-pacific outbound flights. Entertainment with the large 787 PTV helped me to kill time with selected movies - some of them were just in cinemas weeks ago. Cabin crews are reachable and willing to help, I saw them cleaning the lavatory mirror and toilet which is a plus. Ground service in T2 I encountered wasn’t that pleasant in contrast with the larger terminal 3 PEK, and it did take more time for transfer passengers. The only major down side of Hainan is their online booking system is not the friendliest I ever used, redesigning is suggested. Overall I am pleased to find this SJC based new route and merry to say goodbye with SFO as well as CA, UA, CI. Pretty sure I’ll use Hainan again for my future NE/SE Asia trips if they offer more connecting flights in PEK.",Boeing 787-8,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Jose to Beijing,October 2015,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4,yes
"""an excellent experience""",9,David Clancy,26th October 2015,"Toronto to Beijing return with Hainan Airlines was an excellent experience. The cleanliness and cabin service was really good.

"""Hainan Airlines trip was pleasant""",8,Alan Andre,25th September 2015,"My Hainan Airlines trip from Seattle to Bangkok via Beijing was pleasant but it didn't start that way and was mostly my fault. My flight was one way from Seattle to Bangkok, and at first they would not let me check in, indicating I needed a return ticket. This is actually normal. I was a bit frustrated and in my panic neglected to say I had a visa. Once that was determined, the staff apologized saying they should have also checked. The flight was very good, the inflight entertainment was acceptable and the food good. The flight from Seattle to Beijing was on time, but Beijing to Bangkok was delayed about an hour. However, we made most of the time up in the air. The economy class seats seemed a bit hard to me.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,SEA to BKK via Beijing,July 2015,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,5,yes

Airport service okay, Guangzhou Airport not good! Onboard, the cabin staff were so sweet and friendly, probably the best cabin service I can remember in years. A flat bed seat, duvet and more on a domestic flight is truly 5 star service and they deserve. Food was nicely served and of very good standard. Definitely recommend to all who may have never heard of this airline, and it is more Asian than Chinese - by which I mean you would never want to fly Air China, Eastern or Southern as alternative choice here in China.",,Business,First Class,CAN to PEK,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,5,yes
"""best domestic airline to fly in China""",9,Graeme Bray,10th August 2015,"Heavily delayed flight but outside of airlines control. This is simply the best domestic airline to fly within China. Despite not having an exit row seat, I had great legroom. From Lanzhou to Xi'an the seat beside me was empty but after the short stopover, it was filled on the next leg to Xiamen. A snack was served on the short first leg, with a full delicious meal handed out on the second leg. I was able to be served several cups of juice on each leg, which was great considering how delayed and thirsty I had become. The staff onboard were fantastic and went out of their way to obtain an English newspaper for me, being the only westerner on this scheduled service. Inflight entertainment was from Android tablets that were not really setup for English users but I was able to get it to work.

But Shanghai Pudong airport is poor due to airport not being a hub for Hainan Airlines, they didn't use airbridge and a bus required a bus to get to the plane.

Hainan Airlines customer review,9,Charles Qian Li,19th June 2015,"As a frequent Chicago-Beijing-route traveller, I know the available carriers quite well, Hainan, United, and American Airlines. Hainan flies this route with its Boeing 787. One thing I love the most about Hainan is that the toilets are always clean! Trust me when I say the sanitary condition of cabin toilets are important for people spending 12 hours or more on international flights, because you will use the toilets at least once. I was sitting in 40K, which is the first role of the second section of the Economy class cabin, and I saw the flight attendants cleaning the toilets on an hourly basis with air freshener. Although I was a little disappointed when Hainan changed its breakfast menu (it used to offer omelet and sausage on all international flights, which I think is the best in-flight breakfast I have ever had!), the food is still pretty nice and superior to other carriers. The flight also offers a self-service snack and beverage bar at the back. And if you have special requests, the flight attendants are always there to provide you with whatever you need. Inflight Entertainment, Hainan still has a long way to go. But I don't see it as a problem, because compared with the entertainment systems on other carriers (Air China, American Airlines, United, Delta, Air Canada), Hainan's still far more superior. Many hit shows and sitcoms are included.  One weakness which Hainan and all Chinese airlines all have is the language service. Although the captain spoke perfectly fluent English, some cabin members didn't. Foreigners may face difficulty understanding their safety instruction or communicating their needs. They still need to work on that.",Boeing 787-8,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Beijing to Chicago,June 2015,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5,yes

Hainan Airlines customer review,2,Alexander Vankov,20th May 2015,Flew 4 segments by HU from Moscow thru Beijing to Sanya and back. All the aircraft were quite aged and noisy inside. No screens for entertainment at all! They offered small ipads but all the content (quite limited) was in Chinese only. Might be OK for domestic flights but for long-haul international segments I find it unacceptable. For me the food was acceptable. The schedule was changed for 3 flights of 4 after the ticket was purchased. Had to wait for 1 hour at Beijing airport in the middle of the night for the shuttle to the hotel that HU promised to take care of.

Hainan Airlines customer review,8,B Rich,14th January 2015,"Looked for a cheap business class option from Hong Kong back to the USA for Christmas. Hainan Airlines met that requirement and so off I went. The Hainan leg stateside and back was the 787 to Chicago and back from Seattle. Overall the service was quite good. A few people have cited a limited English speaking cabin crew which I will agree with but I am travelling on their airline so I won't complain about that besides it was good enough back from Seattle was very good. The food was good in both directions offering Asian Western and vegetarian meals but not quite up to the standard of other carriers. The lounge access was my biggest complaint Terminal 2 in Beijing is quite old and the lounge is very basic with limited food choice and beverage. The wifi was very weak also. In Seattle they use the Cascade Club Lounge (extremely limited in selection quite disappointing really) in the A concourse and it's a bit of a trek to the S gates via the little subway but a shuttle is provided (if the driver can be found!) if you don't want to walk to the train. In flight entertainment was sufficient but the ""new releases"" were quite far from that however the selection was good enough for a total of 23 hours of travel in both directions. The 787 itself is a nice comfortable aircraft and Hainans Business Class lie flat seat was quite comfortable and the duvet very nice. The pillow could have been bigger however. Overall I will certainly fly with them again as the value for money for Business Class was very good.",,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,,5,yes
Hainan Airlines customer review,8,Mak Samuel,14th January 2015,We just came back from Asia and flew from Toronto to Beijing. We needed to change to Hong Kong Air from Beijing to HK. We found the airline is just as good as any North American airlines and in some areas are better than them. We read a comment about the washroom cleanliness but we did not observe that and in fact we saw the flight attendants constantly going in the washroom to inspect. The seats are not bad as it is a Boeing 787 and not the Airbus. The entertainment may not be great but it is acceptable. The food is just the normal flight food as it is the same as any North American flights so they are ok. The flight attendants realized that we don't speak mandarin so they talked to us in English. Now we read some comments about the English level of the flight attendants but frankly they probably speak better English than we speak mandarin so to complain about their English is not realistic. Their English is just fine. The flights are great as compared to some of the airlines that we have been flying with. Definitely recommend Hainan.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,4,yes
Hainan Airlines customer review,7,Will Walter,1st December 2014,ORD-PEK-ORD. The service and food were great. FAs were pleasant with some language difficulties.

Hainan Airlines customer review,7,J Thesen,6th September 2014,Flew WUH-PEK-BRU and back in Summer 2014. Don't set your expectations too high. The flight to Brussels is always late and again: I received a text message 3 hours before informing me it would be 1 hour late. The most inconvenient thing is transiting between Terminal 1+2 in Beijing - it is a long and cumbersome way. But also checking in took too long and in Wuhan they shared their check-in counter with other airlines thus very slow. There was no alcohol on the domestic flight and drinks were served 20 minutes after the meal (which is also rather mediocre). It is a Chinese thing but as a Westerner I want my red wine together with the meal. The first intl. flight was on an old machine with rather old-fashioned IFE way back was much better though. I missed English subtitles on their Chinese movies! A note on their website: Generally looking good but the special meal option never worked and on the last flight they put us on different seats than I selected. On the upside things I liked: 1) We did the Airail segment to Paris but were not asked for our train tickets. 2) The red cabin interior is rather nice. 3) The transiting lounge in Beijing was very empty in the evening seats comfortable and there was tea for free. However next time I will choose a Western carrier preferably Turkish Airlines.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,4,no
Hainan Airlines customer review,10,P Sprumont,18th August 2014,"Geneva-Brussels-Beijing on 5th August return on 13th August. First and last legs between GVA and BRU crowded but Brussels Airlines' crews managed to serve a light breakfast with good coffee. Lounge in Brussels by British Airways: acceptable for a 2-hour wait. Warm and smiling welcome aboard (not addressed by name but I did not care). Helped to lift my hand luggage in the lockers but not quickly enough on the return flight: my trunk fell on me. No harm done and the hostesses were so sorry and kind. Excellent meals with first-class wines (I loved the Sangre de Toro). Full flat beds where I could turn myself without problems (I am 185 cm) thin mattress and duvet. During both long journeys I could sleep 7 hours also due to quietness of Airbus A333. Finally I was accompanied by a ""guide"" through Terminal 2 in Beijing and driven in a limo to and from my hotel in Beijing.

Hainan Airlines customer review,9,Frank Zhao,25th May 2014,PVG-LHW. Window seat. Checkin was quick and efficient given that PVG is not Hainan's hub and not many flights out from PVG. My checked bag was overweight but they waived the charge. They changed their flight attendant uniforms from the winter dark purple to the summer bright grey which looked nicer. The flight was delayed for half an hour due to the delay of the inbound flight. But the preparation and boarding afterwards were quick and efficient. Seat was standard and comfortable not so different than other major domestic airlines. I ordered a sea food meal a special meal service that you can order on their website if you bought the ticket there. My food was served before the cabin food service and It was superb and way beyond my expectation. It looked and tasted better than some international flights to the US. Flight attendant was polite and carefully performed security check before take off and landing which was very professional. The entertainment was mundane but it was the same standard across China.

Ok some of their English is not what you may expect as a foreign traveler but they try so hard smile and are genuine. Food was top class on all flights and seat comfort is much better than European carriers like Lufthansa or KLM.

Hainan Airlines customer review,8,R Tyson,21st April 2014,Review based on 1 RT economy flight from Seattle to Hangzhou via Beijing. I would rate them a solid 4 out of 5 on pretty much everything. Our connecting flight from Beijing to Hangzhou was cancelled 2 days before flight. They contacted us by phone and gave us option of staying overnight in Beijing at their expense and taking first flight in morning which we accepted. All that went off without a hitch. On arriving in Beijing on our way back to Seattle we were met at the gate by a Hainan employee who walked us through baggage claim customs and security all the way to the gate for our Seattle flight which was in another terminal. This was a tremendous help. Inflight service food etc was neither remarkably good or bad. They were efficient and friendly but don't have the noticeable class or polish of a top of the line carrier. Also the English language skills of their reservation staff is just barely adequate. I had to contact them by phone several times prior to the flight to confirm our flight change and that proved fairly stressful though everything worked out in the end. Both international flights appeared to be new or nearly new aircraft. Connecting flights between Beijing and Hangzhou were noticeably older but clean and well maintained. Overall I'd say they are quite acceptable for a budget airline though a notch below the top of the lines such as Singapore airlines. Would not hesitate to fly with them again.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,5,yes
Hainan Airlines customer review,7,S Wing,21st April 2014,Chicago to Beijing RT - 787-8. Check in on both ends was seamless but had ORD had a long line. IFE was quite up- to-date with movies and TV no shortage of things to watch during the ~14 hour flight. Seat was one of the better coach seats I've ever sat in with the recline mode putting into a relatively comfortable sleeping position. Food was really quite decent but won't win any awards if served on the ground somewhere. Service was generally attentive and kind without being overbearing. May not go out of their way to ask about you but will field any request that comes their way. 787 was very comfortable and noticeably reduced fatigue. Overall 787 on Hainan is a great product especially at the price.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,5,yes

Hainan Airlines customer review,9,R Sparrowe,17th March 2014,"ORD-PEK on 787 then PEK-PVG on a 737 and return in Business (First) Class. Easy check-in and boarding at ORD. Attentive service great seat (flat bed) and AVOD with 20 or so current movies. Tip: spread the duvet out on the seat and sleep on top of it as the cushions are very firm. On landing in Beijing we had to transfer from Terminal 2 to Terminal 1. Instructions were clear but we couldn't locate the shuttle and walked the distance between Terminals. If you are young this is no problem. If old and creaky like us it is a long walk. Flight from PEK to PVG was ordinary 737 with standard ""first class"" recliners as would be found in domestic flights in the U.S. The return leg from PVG to PEK was the same as the outbound but once arriving in PEK we were met by a gate agent herded to a bus and taken from Terminal 1 to Terminal 2. Along the way we gathered our bags then rechecked them. That saved us a lot of wandering through corridors dragging luggage. I was surprised to realize that our 787 flight boarded off-terminal it was a long bus ride out to the plane. Once on board however the champagne arrived and all was well. Food on the return trip seemed fresher and the flight attendants were much more capable and attentive - more like Asiana than a regional Chinese airline.

The new Dreamliner plane seemed pretty nice and the seats were comfortable their Mango juice and Coconut juice is delicious. Two hours into the flight I was asked by one of the flight attendants to turn off my phone which was in Airplane Mode. I told the Flight attendant who spoke very limited English that it's in Airplane Mode but he insisted that I must turn it off. Aside from the crew's and pilot's lack of English skills the food is just subpar and the sides they give you are barely edible.

Cabin crew polite professional and helpful significantly improved compared to my experience several years ago but still a bit behind other Asian airlines such as EVA. Food is excellent. Ticket bought at the last minute a bit expensive at 7k+ but cheaper than Delta. For a direct flight between these two cities there are no better choices. Terminal 2 at PEK airport is the most convenient terminal easy in and out. Will have to fly this routes several times this year and will choose Hainan again. One very attractive benefit of flying Hainan business class into Beijing if you make prior arrangement via phone or website they will provide free transportation to and from PEK airport in a MB car.

The new 787 is a wonderful aircraft and the A330 was also comfortable from PEK to BKK. On the return On the return Hainan changed aircraft's from BKK to PEK.

Hainan Airlines customer review,4,Robert Wallace,14th January 2014,Flew in late Dec 2013 and early Jan 2014 in Business Class from Chicago to Beijing to Bangkok and then back. The new Dreamliner was a nice comfortable flight. Some of the flight attendants don't speak English well and one of the flight attendants on the flight from Chicago to Beijing was obviously very new and was struggling - but tried none-the-less. At check-in there always seems to be confusion about what the transfer process is in Beijing. One of the real pains is that they will not issue you both tickets when you check in. If your transfer time is more than 4 hours be prepared to sit in the airport until they open the check-in counter. Note the airport in Beijing (Terminal 2 in this case) is not set up for international transfers. You will have to go through immigration and customs so do fill out both the arrival and departure forms (despite any advice to the contrary which we received from flight attendants). The immigration process is not straightforward and we were shuffled from line to line despite being in the correct line to begin with. After making it through Security (again confusing and not straight forward) don't get your hopes up on the lounge - it's a run down lounge with poor amenities - big disappointment after seeing the lounge in Terminal 1 advertised for domestic flights. In all flying internationally with Hainan is not an all positive experience but of the airline listens to its Customers and resolve these issues to bring it up to he standards and ease of flying as with most world airlines there is potential here.,,,Business Class,,,0.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,,4,no

Arrived in Seattle and went to the British Airlines Terraces lounge where I was told Hainan hasn't used the lounge for over 4 months and that their lounge was in the other terminal about twenty minute walk each way. The Hainan gate agent first said that she wouldn't recommend that I go to the lounge because of the distance but then wrote me out an invitation. The business seating on their A330 is 2-2-2 in two cabins. We were served snacks and non-alcoholic welcome drinks pre-departure. The seats are lay flat and they do make up the seats with pads sheets and a fluffy comforter. Additionally they offer pyjamas - nice touch. Although no menus were distributed and the English language skills of the flight attendants is very poor the food was good both Western and Asia selections. Beverage service and selection is extremely limited. It took over one hour after reaching cruising altitude before any beverages were served. The beverages on offer were extremely limited. One type of champagne white and red wine. No premium brands. Liquors were also extremely limited. Transfer in Beijing was horrible. Hainan ground agents told me that I had to clear immigration and customs and collect and recheck my check bag. While waiting a general service agent came up to me and in perfect English said that I should go to the departure counter as my bag would not be coming off. It was checked all the way through but Hainan agents are all too new to know this. The lounge on the website is not one that was offered. They only show the first class lounge and business class is contract hosted in a rather dated lounge. The only food on offer was soup or pastry and beverages were also limited. There was a shower facility with limited amenities. The A330 had the new staggered business class seating. Again no menus and the flight attendant English poor. No premium cocktails available only two types of beer one red wine and one white wine. No champagne. No Fast Track access provided. The fare was cheap but you get what you pay for. I will see if there is any difference with the return flight on the new Dreamliner.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,,3,no
Hainan Airlines customer review,6,Julian van Podex,29th October 2013,"Xi'an to Shenzen. Check-in quick. Done with mediocre English but enough to get it done. Only foreigner on board. Staff efficient at best. Food was pretty bad in general an ""OK"" flight to get from A-B but that is about it.",,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,,4,yes
Hainan Airlines customer review,3,Douglas Karr,16th October 2013,Flight was from Toronto to Beijing China and return. Good food good service poor seats. I have never sat on such an uncomfortable seat. Some seat backs would not stay upright. Duct tape on some seats and pocket was pulling apart where the magazines where stored. Airplane was a A340. Each flight was 13 hours. The seats need to be replaced.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,3,no
Hainan Airlines customer review,5,M André,5th August 2013,Berlin - Bejing. A330 cabin was in fair condition but nothing special. Seat had a defect I could not adjust the backrest from the upright position the entertainment system was in poor condition but worked. Had a 1.5hr delay to Beijing connection flight to Hong Kong was cancelled. Only by chance we learned about the cancellation and a bus to a hotel. Until we were informed in the hotel that there will be a flight that night so driven back to the airport. Flight back worked well. Lesson learned never transit over China anymore taking a quality airline like Lufthansa Cathay BA and the long distance flight to HKG directly to the final destination.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,4,no
Hainan Airlines customer review,2,Guy Allen,30th July 2013,Beijing to Toronto HU 7975 July 17 2013. Very uncomfortable seat too small. When the person in front reclined her seat it crushed my knees. The in-flight entertainment at my seat did not work on either flight of a round trip. The screens of several people around me did not work either.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,,2,no
Hainan Airlines customer review,6,M de Beer,28th July 2013,"Toronto - Beijing in Business with a family of 4. Airbus 340's interior is certainly showing its age. They double assigned one of our seats but this was fairly quickly resolved on board. Upon departure it was apparent that virtually 80% of all head sets were faulty. The 3 pin plug is in an impossible location and flight attendants had to perform incredible manoeuvres to plug in ""new"" headsets. Decent selection of movies but the image quality is poor and system keeps cutting out. It is worth noting that while the many online seat plan sites indicate that the business class seats offer power outlets this is not the case! Seats recline but as it is no lie flat bed those used to sleeping on their stomachs may find it hard to get some sleep. Flight attendants automatically refill your drinks which is nice. Dinner tray was served with starter and dessert pre-set and main courses were served separately. My tray was cleared prior to my main course being served which is nice but it meant my dessert was gone as well. All in all it was decent value for money but if your budget allows for full service business class I would not recommend Hainan Airlines.",,,Business Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,4,no
Hainan Airlines customer review,4,N Spronk,5th July 2013,"Toronto to Shanghai return via Beijing. Travel dates supposed to be 17/06/2013 - 29/06/13. Departing plane was late and cost me my Shanghai Connection and one night. Return flight from Shanghai to Beijing was delayed 8 hours and cost me connection to Toronto on the 29. Incredibly they could not put me up on another connecting flight until July 3! To get this I had to stand in a 2.5 hr queue. I found the food on Hainan better than average legroom below average (I am 6'1""). My flight over had good movie selection but annoyingly bad sound. The plane was too hot.",,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,3,no
Hainan Airlines customer review,5,P Brown,5th June 2013,Flew first class round trip. Flew on a highly discounted fare. Seat was similar to Thai and Lufthansa's A340-600 first class seat. This 340-600 is worn. Video was broken at my seat outbound. All AV is old and antiquated. Crew try to be very helpful. Food was delicious. Especially Chinese offering on return flight from Beijing. Beautifully presented. Helpful check-in at Beijing. If you book their free limo they meet you at curb side and escort you as far as immigration. Lounge at Beijing was good. Only person in the first class lounge. Overall good value for the money. Only $1400.00 more than business return. Well worth it for the extra space.,,,First Class,,,4.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,,4,yes
Hainan Airlines customer review,10,William Bonney,28th April 2013,We had 2 hours to catch a connecting flight from Chengdu to Beijing to Seattle. We had to pick up our luggage at baggage claim in Beijing and then go to terminal 2 to get our prepaid ticket and check our bags and go through the detectors and get out to the correct gate. We probably would not have made it on time without the helpful Hainan Air attendant who walked with us through all of the afore mentioned stations and waited with us. With his help it took 1 hour and 20 minutes which gave us 40 minutes before take off and no stress. I will fly them on my next trip to Asia.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,5,yes
Hainan Airlines customer review,10,Konno Yusuke,22nd April 2013,PEK to TXL Germany flight: HU489. Beyond my expectation. Aircraft was quite new the entertainment system is acceptable. Cabin crew are nice and smiled all the time checked the cabin every time I opened my eyes and one stewardess answered my questions attentively. Meals served hit the spot for economy. Inbound was as good as the outbound flight.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,4,yes
Hainan Airlines customer review,3,S Kennedy,21st April 2013,Toronto to Beijing. Seat legroom was minimal cabin interior was dirty and shabby. My seat table and the one of my neighbor was filthy with food and other matter from previous use. One of the washroom sinks was broken so there was no means of washing your hands. AV system kept shutting down. Overall it was a very unpleasant experience and my last with this airline. Pay a little more and get some basic comfort.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,,3,no
Hainan Airlines customer review,10,C Tudehope,28th December 2012,"Took multiple domestic flights with HU in December from PEK to SHA and XIY on their 330 and 737-800 aircraft. All flights were pretty much on time (the latest was 5 mins late). Onboard catering was superb for a domestic flight with as much as I would expect on an international flight - and then they came to ask who wanted seconds! Inflight entertainment was provided on the 330 aircraft which again was of an international standard. The terminal in PEK which is solely used by HU is very pleasant and easy to use. The crew were very friendly and promptly answered any enquiries. The legroom was great (I'm 6'4"" - so that's no easy feat) and in general having done extensive travel I would say this is the best domestic airline in China. No hesitations in flying with them again.",,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
Hainan Airlines customer review,8,M Sun,6th December 2012,PEK-YYZ. Business Class. Hainan uses the KLM lounge in YYZ which was very standard. Seats in 1-2-1 configuration new business class. Breakfast was adequate Lunch was nice - western dishes and dinner I chose Chinese dishes which were the best I had on the fight. Entertainment was nice but a little bit cheesy. The seats are comfortable. Would definitely recommend.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,4,yes
Hainan Airlines customer review,6,Peter Thackray,27th November 2012,YIX-CTU Economy. Flew B737-700. Inside fitted out with their Red colour scheme economy seats OK but not much leg room. Flight slightly late due to late departure. English announcements made. Hot drink and packet of dried Pea snack given which was OK on a 75 minute flight may not be quite so good for a longer flight. Cabin clean but slightly tired looking.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,0.0,,3,yes
Hainan Airlines customer review,6,P Muntz,21st November 2012,SEA-PEK-CAN roundtrip. Hard not to recommend Hainan in light of the price difference between Hainan and other airlines. However the aisles are narrow. For the SEA-PEK flight (Airbus A330-200) legroom was tight. Seats are not well padded and by the end of each trip I could hardly sit still. The big thing to be aware of though is the transfer process in Beijing. Upon arrival in Beijing we had to deplane by walking down 2 flights of stairs board a shuttle bus to the terminal up another couple of flights of stairs claim your checked bags go through immigration walk 15-20 minutes to a different terminal check in for the next flight and recheck your bags then go to the gate and wait for the flight. My experience flying to China is limited but I think this process is more convoluted than with other airlines. There were 2 meals on the 11 hour flights across the Pacific and one on the in-country flight and they were all good. Beverage service leaves something to be desired. On the long flight I think we were offered drinks only 4 times and each time using very small cups. The seatback video system has a decent array of choices but is very glitchy and can be difficult to use. Headphones are a little uncomfortable and use the Asian double-plug connection so single- plug US headphones will not work properly. The crew were good though not as consistently present in the aisles as on other airlines and spoke English well. On my return trip I found myself I'd probably try to use a US airline for the US-to-China flight but in reality due to the fact that Hainan is $200 to $400 cheaper than the next least expensive option I'd probably opt for Hainan again.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,5,yes
Hainan Airlines customer review,10,T Impson,14th November 2012,Hangzhou to Shenzhen on a 737-800. Plane was well maintained and the leg room excellent. The snack box served was ok for such a short flight. Departed and arrived on time and our luggage was out fairly quickly. English announcements could be made more clear but otherwise great staff. Hainan Airlines still seem to be a great choice when travelling locally in China as the price is good with good service and nice clean comfortable planes.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,3.0,0.0,,5,yes
Hainan Airlines customer review,7,Janis Kruzevnaks,22nd October 2012,BRU-PEK-CAN-PEK-TXL Economy. Seat width and pitch is pretty comfortable although on first long haul leg plane was pretty worn seatback was fully reclinable. Staff very friendly inflight entertainment had plenty to do for the whole flight. Nice service on local flights from PEK to CAN also very friendly staff and meal was a really nice touch for 3.5 hour flight.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,,4,yes
Hainan Airlines customer review,10,D Beckenbaugh,21st October 2012,Flight out of SEA delayed. Arrived PEK 3 hours late and watched my connection to PVG leave as we landed. Booked on the next CEA flight and got to the gate with 5 minutes to spare. On flight last year from Shenzhen to SEA flight into PEK was weather delayed (snow) and I missed my connection. HU was still running daily flights at that time and rebooked me to next day. I asked for discount voucher for hotel but was refused. Instead they gave me a free hotel meals and ground transport. Even though it was my agents fault for booking flight connection too close. Only problem seems entertainment system does not want to work in exit row.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,,5,yes
Hainan Airlines customer review,10,Ian Hamilton,17th September 2012,Beijing to Brussels Business Class. Simply excellent service great food and very comfortable seat on what appeared to be a new aeroplane. The flight attendant spilt three glasses of red wine over me just after take- off - she was mortified. I changed into a slumber suit and my jeans and shirt were returned to me thirty minutes before landing pressed and folded without a hint of the wine stains.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,5,yes
Hainan Airlines customer review,3,M Gustafsson,29th August 2012,Berlin-Bejing-Berlin. After food was served it took almost 40 minutes before drinks arrived. Pointed out this to the FA's who however did no understand the problem. Thought it might have been a temporary glitch but the pattern was the same on the return trip. On the flight back to Beijing they served beer and wine with the lunch which in itself was terrible but apparently they had a policy of not serving it with dinner. Strange! Bad seat recline. Will go back to flying with Finnair when travelling to China.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1,no
Hainan Airlines customer review,5,D Valero,28th August 2012,"Zurich to Beijing and onward to Shanghai Hongqiao on August 14/15. Return on 25/26 August. Overall I found it very mediocre: Positive aspects were the attitude and service from the flight crew and varied entertainment offer on Zurich-Beijing legs. The passenger transit lounge in Beijing was great as it gives you the possibility to relax in a quiet place before continuing the journey. Negative aspects were the oldish plane(s) from Zurich to Beijing and return (A330-200). The design was too pompous with red and yellow/golden patterns and carpets. The two worst points I observed: for transfer the baggage needed to be collected and checked-in again at another terminal not only when entering China but also on the return journey i.e. despite the ""leaving China formalities"" had already been cleared in Shanghai. The location of the plane at Beijing airport was upsetting: Arriving from Zurich the whole plane was emptied with buses instead of using an air bridge. When leaving Beijing the gate was so far from the aircraft. Passengers started making jokes about whether we would arrive to Zurich by bus. I wonder what the causes are for this as at 2 am there may have been many air bridges ready to use. All in all it was ok.",,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Hainan Airlines customer review,,P Acheson,18th June 2012,"Three flights: (1) SEA-PEK May 12 2012. Satisfactory flight but almost inedible first meal. (2) Moscow-PEK June 9-11 2012. (20.55 Departure) Flight initially delayed 2 hours then 11 more hours until June 10. Official reason given was ""weather."" Unofficial reason (given to one transit passenger): pilot was too tired to fly. Everyone with a Russian visa was taken to a nearby hotel for a few hours' sleep. Transit passengers left to try to sleep in the airport. The next day not a single word of apology was given for the delay. (3) PEK-SEA June 11 2012. Not a single seat in economy class would recline more than 0.5"" (1.0 cm)! This made for a mostly sleepless 11-hour flight. Some passengers opted for the floor others made a mound of their blankets and micro-pillows on their folding tables and put their heads on them. Attendants seemed just as surprised as the passengers about the non-reclinable seats as did a pilot I spoke to upon arrival in Seattle.",,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1,no
Hainan Airlines customer review,3,Bob Cleary,18th June 2012,Beijing to Seattle. Check-in at Beijing average and no issues boarding a bit of a cattle call. Aircraft A30-200 was showing age. Seating seemed a bit cramped. Food was plentiful but average. AVOD system was acceptable for the length of flight. Flight attendants were pleasant and accommodating. However disappeared after the meal service. For a 5 star rated carrier it was missing in economy must only apply to first class. Would not fly again.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1,no
Hainan Airlines customer review,7,D Manning,12th June 2012,PEK-CAN. Boeing 737 looked old but it was fairly comfortable. I had just flown in from Seattle via Hainan and was a great experience but this one was not as good. To my surprise the same FA's who were on the previous leg of the trip from SEA to Beijing were on the flight and were a little crabby after 12 hours on a different plane. When I said I didn't want any food she seemed concerned and only after much persuading did she go away. Overall not the best but not horrible.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Hainan Airlines customer review,9,D French,12th June 2012,PEK-PVG-PEK. Was the cheapest flight I could get so wasn't expecting much. What a pleasant surprise. Excellent food new clean and comfortable cabin and seats (A340-300 out 737-800 return) efficient and courteous staff at check-in and onboard. Need to be stricter with take off safety though - the girl next to me was allowed to have her laptop out for take off which on all other airlines I have flown with is a complete no no. Checked in just too late on return leg - check-in assistant could have been friendlier but directed me to another counter where a very helpful lady got me on the next flight. Overall excellent and wasn't surprised when I discovered the five star rating. (Just be aware that T1 at PEK belongs to Hainan but if arriving on the airport express train at T2 you need to allow 15 mins to ensure you are at T1 on time and it's all on foot/travelators).,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Hainan Airlines customer review,7,G Ireland,22nd May 2012,"YYZ-PEK in Business Class. Check-in at YYZ was uneventful HU uses the KLM Lounge which is average. Boarding was smooth and the ritual juice and champagne were brought around. A340-600 with conventional 2-2-2- seating. The ""lie-flat"" seats only go back 168 degrees were a little battered. Flight was on time but the drink and meal service was slow. The English of a couple of the FA's was not great. They ran out of western meals by the time they got to me but the shrimp and stir-fried noodles were excellent. The second meal service was adequate but less inspiring. Arrival in PEK was on time and the promised limo was waiting to take me downtown. All in all a good flight.",,,Business Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Hainan Airlines customer review,3,A Johnsen,15th May 2012,Roundtrip flight from Beijing to Taipei and it was an overall miserable experience. While the crew for the most part was relatively friendly and helpful the planes felt old and well-used (despite being new 737-800s). On both legs rafts took up significant portions of the overhead storage space and on the return flight my seat back was broken and would not stay upright my air blower barely worked which was not pleasant considering how hot the cabin was. Finally my flight out to Taipei was delayed 3 hours and they actually served us our breakfast while still at the gate. This was the only real indication that the delay would be a long one since the very few announcements we received only stated that we were being delayed.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1,no
Hainan Airlines customer review,10,D Manning,1st May 2012,SEA-PEK. A330-200 was very clean as were the lavatories. The food was good. The snack they served us was seaweed covered peanuts which were very good. In Seattle the customer service agent was very polite and helpful and got us four middle seats together. Flight attendants onboard were very nice and friendly and the flight experienced no delays.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Hainan Airlines customer review,10,S Osborne,24th April 2012,Seattle-Beijing-Chengdu return was a great experience! Ground staff and cabin crew went out of their way to help me. They were polite and food/drink service was very good. I had a 15.5 hour lay-over in Beijing and a good clean hotel was included in my ticket price plus transportation to the hotel and back.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Hainan Airlines customer review,9,P Moor,7th March 2012,Flew from Seattle to Beijing and back last month first time with Hainan. They were the cheapest but the service was straight down the line no problems with service food or video etc. Legroom was tight in economy compared to the Alaska Air flight I was using to get to SEATAC but I was happy especially given the cost.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Hainan Airlines customer review,9,John Wu,27th February 2012,Beijing to Shenzhen on A340-600. Seat was a lie flat business class seat with AVOD and came with a duvet and proper cushion. The cabin was showing its age somewhat. The meal was very good. I chose the western main and it was very good. Departures from Beijing are from Terminal 1 flight delayed 90 minutes. Hainan didn't handle the delay that well on the ground - no updated information was provided and announcements were only in Mandarin. In comparison to US and European flights of a similar length service and seat were fantastic.,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Hainan Airlines customer review,8,P Schulz,8th February 2012,Beijing-Xiamen definitely not the brand-new B737 I was expecting but a fairly old B737-400. Excellent crew food okay and very speedy service. First domestic flight in China and Hainan Airlines was a good choice although I was hoping for more after reading they were a five star airline.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Hainan Airlines customer review,9,C Cooledge,22nd December 2011,Beijing-Shenzhen-Sydney. Beijing-Shenzhen leg an A340 Business class a bit worn but very good for domestic service. 4-course meal served and drinks were prompt. Beijing-Sydney a new A330-300. 1x2x1 seating in business class fully-flat seats that were extremely private. Dinner and breakfast served. Food is good but not as great as other 4/5 Star airlines. Apparently it is best to stick with the Asian choices. Seats and onboard services excellent and make up for the food. The value for money is spectacular.,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Hainan Airlines customer review,10,J Curd,10th November 2011,Hong Kong (Shenzen) to Beijing. Flight delayed a few hours but I ate dinner in the first class lounge. Once finally onboard everything was seemingly brand new. The airbus A330 was very clean and the flight attendants provided more food. The airline was a very pleasant surprise and great value for the money.,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Hainan Airlines customer review,10,L Wang,31st October 2011,INC-PEK-BRU-BHX transfered in Beijing and Brussels. Economy class. INC-PEK and PEK-BRU operated by Hainan airlines and BRU-BHX operated by Brussel Airlines. Connecting service is efficient I got all my boarding passes at PEK and my luggage delivered directly to Birmingham. Polite staff and fairly new 737-800 (INC-PEK) and A330-200(PEK-BRU). I ordered seafood online and it was tasty. Worthy of ticket price.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Hainan Airlines customer review,9,C Cooledge,12th September 2011,Shanghai-PEK. Business class was $100 for a one-way ticket. A330 was clean seats are lie-flat food is great (for a 1.5 hr flight) and flight attendants were well trained. Completely exceeded my expectations.,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Hainan Airlines customer review,8,Tim Kelly,5th September 2011,Sydney to Shenzhen return. One way Economy and the return flight in Business Class. For the Economy sector I was given an exit row seat automatically (I am 203cm tall) and did not have to ask. The food was good video on demand excellent and the cleanliness of the bathrooms impressive. My only criticism was that they told me that they only have 2 bottles of white wine in Economy for a 9 hr journey. Coming home I paid for an upgrade to Business Class for the over night journey back to Sydney. There was no-one in 1st class and only 4 people in Business Class the crew upgrade all passengers to 1st class cabin and provided Business Class service. The food and wine list had many choices although my video on demand did not work in 1A. Being a taller person I still did not fit on the lie flat bed. However with the combo of Y class outbound and J return the fare represents great value for money.,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Hainan Airlines customer review,8,Norman Ho,31st August 2011,Sydney to Shenzhen return. Leaving Sydney delayed 6 hours due to adverse weather in Shenzhen but passengers were well looked after given a meal voucher and informed of the expected departure time. Cabin seat was comfortable good meal service and helpful crews. Meal service flying back from Shenzhen was particularly good considering I was in Economy cabin.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Hainan Airlines customer review,7,J Blanchard,20th August 2011,PEK-SVO LED-PEK. Service was fine staff try very hard with their English but I would not rate it as fluent. My flights were both on time the B767 LED-PEK was cramped and in need of replacement.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Hainan Airlines customer review,8,Chris Huntoon,24th May 2011,Seattle to Beijing return. This airline was the cheapest but came with a very good rating from the website. I felt pretty cramped but then again I was a 250lb guy so it was probably to be expected. AVOD a bit finicky and the movie selection wasn't great but it was better than nothing for 11 hours. The Western food selections were mediocre at best. The staff speak little English that it was hard to communicate that I wanted something else. Food aside this was a clean efficient airline that I would fly again but might shell out the extra money for an upgrade.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Hainan Airlines customer review,9,J Porle,11th May 2011,Flew From Chongqing to Guangzhou on a 737. The staff was very friendly and spoke almost perfect English. A meal was served even though the flight was barely an hour. I would go out of my way to fly Hainan.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Hainan Airlines customer review,8,Jan Aghina,31st March 2011,Brussels-Shanghai A330-20. Flight attendants friendly and helpful tasty food clean toilets during the whole flight. On the flight back we seat in row 20 super legroom but a lot of Chinese passengers took row 20 as a bypass to the toilets - not so pretty!,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Hainan Airlines customer review,9,Eric Wang,29th March 2011,Toronto to Beijing last month in Business Class. Overall quite satisfied with the food and the service. Excellent mannered flight attendants and comprehensive movie choices on the Personal Entertainment System. The seat is very comfortable too. Additionally the meal is tasty and passengers are allowed to order anytime they wish.,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Hainan Airlines customer review,10,Casper van der Walt,22nd January 2011,Kunming to Haikou and was pleasantly surprised by this airline!. I have flown many times in China and I had the best flight ever with Hainan Airlines. New plane B737-800 very friendly cabin attendants who could speak good English and tasty food. Will definitely use them again. Everything began with check-in (long lines at check-in) where a friendly young man took my luggage and checked me in as I was the only foreigner on the flight. I felt a bit guilty! For the first time on a Chinese airline friendly and smiling FAs. The other Chinese airlines can learn a thing from Hainan airlines!,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Hainan Airlines customer review,10,Julian Lou,14th January 2011,It's one of the best airlines I have taken (other is Cathy Pacific). Flight attendants are very very friendly. The ticket price is low as well.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Hainan Airlines customer review,10,E Liu,24th December 2010,Beijing-Shanghai economy class on an A330. This airline is a class act I've flown nearly every major Chinese airline and Hainan Airlines definitely stands out. The cabin crew spoke excellent English. Each economy seat had a personal video screen with more choices of Western movies games and short features than many business class international flights offer. Food and beverage service prompt and efficient always with a smile.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Hainan Airlines customer review,7,J Drolet,25th October 2010,Beijing-Xi'an. We boarded on the tarmac then sat on the plane on the ground for 90 minutes due to air traffic congestion. Flight crew very friendly polite bowed during the announcements before and at the end of the trip. It is quite the treat to be served a meal on a domestic Chinese flight - a long dead practice here in North America! The breakfast meal was somewhat strange though : a vegetable porridge andsandwich. It was a nice flight the plane was a fairly new Boeing 737-800. It was my 1st time flying a domestic Chinese airline but an interesting experience at that.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Hainan Airlines customer review,10,Z Mathew,13th September 2010,Beijing to Xian. First time flying on this airline and I was really impressed. Clean well- maintained planes excellent inflight staff who were very attentive. Everyone in our tour group (made up of Americans and Canadians) commented on the excellence of service and food compared to the US airlines. Not even close this Chinese airline was way above most airlines I have travelled. The cabin crew stood and bowed to the passengers as the inflight announcement just before landing thanked all us for choosing to fly with them.

Hainan Airlines customer review,10,M Wu,8th August 2010,This was the best China/US flight experience I've had out of the many times I've traveled. The airplane was new economy seats relatively spacious for economy food was good the service was excellent. Also the inflight entertainment was awesome since every seat had a screen with dozens of titles to choose from from Chinese TV programs to big name movies. There were games available. The bathrooms were cleaned regularly. Also stewardesses came around with water tea and coffee at regular intervals. In the back they had beverages biscuits and sandwiches for between-meal munchies. It was an excellent value and I would recommend them to anyone.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Hainan Airlines customer review,9,T Impson,18th May 2010,Bejing to Hangzhou flight was full but staff very prompt and efficient. Boarding was quick and plane departed and arrived on time. The cabin crew introduced themselves as soon as the plane levelled out and even bowed during the introduction. Very nice touch. Aircraft was very clean and new 737-800. The overhead tv`s had good entertainment. Food was not to my liking but nobody else in my group complained - so it must be me. The only complaint is that they continue to serve drinks and food when the plane is experiencing turbulence? How is it deemed unsafe to use the WC but its deemed safe to serve hot coffee? Other than that no complaints. Would certainly recommend and will try and fly them again over other domestic airlines in China. They certainly are the only 4star airline I have flown on in China.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Hainan Airlines customer review,8,P Dean,12th April 2010,Beijing-Brussels return economy class. Flight out from Beijing was pretty busy at about 70% capacity. was given a seat in exit row - quite useful because you get the extra legroom but seats are awful as the video monitor is placed with the tray on both your left and right on the aisle seats with the middle two seats having only an armrest between the two. So if you are stuck in an aisle seat it is a nightmare. Luckily I got the two middle seats after some people decided to try their luck on another row. Food out from PEK was pretty rough two services. Return was at capacity in Economy food really good for Economy. Was stuck in middle of the 2-4-2 configuration on row 19 and not comfortable only able to get up 3 times during the whole flight. Fluids a bit better with tea/water offered during flight. Service good considering flight capacity attendants did a very good job. Very good inflight entertainment given usual standards from Chinese airlines with a couple of films of really high quality. Full VOD with some 30 films on offer screens mediocre but usable.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Hainan Airlines customer review,10,Ievgen Papanin,2nd February 2010,Guangzhou-Beijing was 1 year old B737-800. Everything was perfect from take off to landing. All stewardesses during flight were near you bringing water giving breakfast etc. Even if a person fell asleep sticker was sticked to your chair and when you woke up stewardess brought breakfast immediately. The second flight was Beijing to Moscow with new A330-200. The same situation - very nice service interesting onboard entertaining system polite english-russian speaking stewards.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Hainan Airlines customer review,9,J Lapides,20th January 2010,Seattle-Beijing-Seattle. New airplanes great business class seats that lie flat. In Seattle they had a ground host who was there just to ensure everything was perfect. The inflight service was friendly and efficient. The only two negatives were a limited number of english language movies and limited in between meal food options. There were more movies on the return flight. Using Beijing terminal number 2 was a big plus as there are much fewer international passengers there resulting in no lines at immigration.,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Hainan Airlines customer review,9,J Depaepe,19th January 2010,BRU-PEK Business Class. 6 hour delay in Brussels but flight was just perfect. Nicest flight attendants ever. New aircraft very personal service great food entertainment very good. Missed our connecting flight to Seoul but Hainan staff waited for us at the gate in Beijing and helped us book another flight. I would recommend this airline to everyone!,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Hainan Airlines customer review,9,Pieter D'hamers,10th January 2010,BRU-PEK-BRU. New A330 good and friendly service. Vegetarian meals correct and good. Every seat with personal TV screen. Toilets were cleaned regularly and seat pitch was about 32 inch. Only minus was that some seats couldn't be adjusted. Price/value was my best China trip in 16 years. Also convenient arrival time in PEK and BRU (early in morning).,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Hainan Airlines customer review,10,Y Chen,9th January 2010,Beijing-Guangzhou B737-800 in economy. Despite the 30 minute delay HNA did well to inform us and right afterward came the departure. Excellent service by flight attendants as they followed requests efficiently. Recommended.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Hainan Airlines customer review,10,A Smith,16th December 2009,XIY to CTU on Boeing 737-800 in Economy. Flight delayed one and a half hours due to weather crew did their best to inform and entertain us during this period. After takeoff flight was absolutely the calmest ever- not the slightest hint of turbulence. Friendly crew explained patiently to pax (including why we were on a Shanxi Airlines a/c as they and Hainan have not fully merged at that time yet and the a/c was yet too be repainted). Landing in Chengdu smooth and arrival equally so.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
