"""thank Lufthansa and its airport crew""",10,Anna Karmazina,21st November 2021,"✅ Trip Verified |  
I would like to thank Lufthansa and its airport crew Cristian Lenz. He is a life saver! On 13-14th of July, 2021 my family and I had to fly Lufthansa Miami - Frankfurt - Kyiv with 2 month old baby, but our flight from Miami delayed for 2+ hours because of weather conditions, we missed our next flight, so, in Frankfurt we asked to give us any flight even through other Germany city, just to get home faster at the same day, so, we've got such a flight with extra city. We were so much tired, with a so little baby, so many and hard flights. At that (third) city (i don't remember which exactly, it was just for transition), we were already exhausted. We forgot my small bag at the airplane with my phone, documents, bank cards, money ut already couldn't return for it. I was in panic, cause in 1.5h we had another flight, to Kyiv. I, with a little baby on my hands, saw an airport crew guy - Mr Lenz, told him about my trouble. Truth be said I didn't think he can help, i thought he sends me to the special service for finding things  as most are doing.. But he said: don't worry, take care of your kids, I will get it for you. I was very happy. The airplane already wasn't at the place, Cristian did real magic and found that my bag before our next flight. I appreciate it so much! I even don't know what we would do, especially with 2 month old baby, who was already very tired. I'm so grateful this Person for His heart and willing to help. Also want to admit the stewardesses on the flight from Miami - they were so attentive, helped much with the baby, changed our row to a one with the extra space and baby bed.. we enjoyed that flight.

"""overhead bin filled up quickly"" ",5,J Wachie,8th November 2021,"Not Verified |  The first leg BER-FRA was delayed due to late arrival of the aircraft. The flight is completely full and the boarding was chaotic without much prioritisation of the Group number. Most passengers brought along huge cabin luggage. The gate staff announced to encourage passengers to check their bags free of charge, but they didn’t go out of their way to pick some obviously large and oversized bags. Once onboard, the overhead bin filled up quickly. Cabin crew were standoff-ish, saying that it was not their job to facilitate the space arrangement.  The flight was further delayed because passengers continued to run up and down the aisle to find space. Once arrived in Frankfurt, there was nobody at the gate to facilitate connecting passengers, so everyone ran for themselves. My second flight FRA-LHR was also further delayed for unknown reasons. Upon boarding, I was told to go to another gate staff to have my documents checked for COVID & locator form etc. The other staff  refused to do it because it wasn’t her duty, whilst the one holding that duty was nowhere to be found. Once onboard, again, similar situation with the overhead bin space reoccurred, but this time the male steward were slightly more hands-on than the previous flight, but they still could do more. This trip wasn’t the first time I encountered LH cabin crew staff’s attitude towards assistance with the overhead bin space. Since before COVID, I’ve gradually switched from BA to LH as my preferred full-service airline, but the LH cabin crew attitude is making me think twice on my future flights, especially LH has now scaled down the inflight catering whilst BA started to offer some free stuff

When I called (again), this time, I was told that the full ticket was canceled and, there were no other available flights for November or December. The free flight change would only cover flights to the same destination within 7 days of the initial booking dates. If I would like to reschedule for January onwards, I would have to pay 1100 Euro per passenger.

"""food in business class has been downgraded""",2,M Deulen,29th October 2021,✅ Trip Verified |  I used to enjoy the food served on Lufthansa business class flights. On short flights it were often just a few bites very nicely presented which gave you the feeling to be a well treated guest by them (and you also always paid the high price for it). On the most recent short haul flights I took with Lufthansa I was shocked the food served in business class has been downgraded while ticket prices are as high or even higher as ever before. The food served on my business class flights were uninspired tasteless sandwiches. They looked similar to the sandwiches Lufthansa used to serve in Economy until a few months ago. If this is their strategy to attract full fare paying guests in Business they really got it wrong. It’s an absolute disgrace for people paying so much money expecting a standard above average.

In the past, the airline delivered not perfect but pretty good services as on the ground as well in the air. The last 5 years the situation has changed drastically. I had multiple serious issues on the ground and in the flight, when Lufthansa staff demonstrated a full ignorance or arrogance to the passengers. The numerous complains to the support line result in formal response without any real measures. The COVID pandemics worsened this disaster service even to more catastrophic. I could provide my personal tens of examples how the Lufthansa employees treat the customers in bad manner, starting from business lounges and further at boarding and in airplane, however, this review is not aimed to make a long story but just to express the general status of the services by Lufthansa. Last but not least, recent changes in price policies and in-flight services just confirm the general trend of company degradation. For example, on some international flights longer than 2 hours (flight FRA-LED), which I recently used, there is no more complimentary food/drinks service. The ticket price, however, increased!

"""overpriced and unworthy""",2,Yevheniy Kahanovych,23rd September 2021,"Not Verified | Paris to Kyiv via Munich with carry-on only. The good news first. Both flights were on time. Both planes were clean. Both crews were courteous. Then the bad news time comes. Online check in was disabled. I arrived to check in desk at CDG2B 3 hours before departure (guessed that all who normally use online check in should be already there). My guess was just partly correct. Not just all Lufthansa, but also Swiss, Austrian and some other airlines sadly shared 3 or 4 staffed desks to check in all the flights to Munich, Frankfurt, Zurich, Vienna and God knows where else. The queue was endless and moving in the slowest possible pace. Things looked quite scary, so I opted to go directly to business class check in with my Turkish frequent flyer card (unsure whether eligible for that). After some 25 min of wait (at business class line folks) I was checked in and given tags for my carry-on.  Boarding was a mess. Calling passengers by groups (to lessen physical contact I guess) gate agents then asked everyone to form a standing queue near the gate door within a small space providing close physical contact. Then the gate door opened, so people were able to board, and without airline staff guidance things got back to normal. Onboard it was ok. The seat back recline has been eliminated since new A320NEO came to fleet, so seat comfort is now not on par with low cost carriers. A bottle of water and wet napkins were handed out. We took off and landed on time. Disembarkation in Munich also went by groups. It slowed things down, but not badly. Then boarding flight to Kyiv was another stupid quest. Without any announcement all the passengers were re-directed to another gate. There instead of boarding we had to get our boarding passes stamped. But with stamped boarding passes instead of boarding the plane we were diverted to the initial gate where they were trying to enforce boarding by groups ignoring the fact that stamping passports was not done by groups, so they were finally able to form quite a big disorganized crowd. Boarding took forever and some more covid infection was spread in this interesting way. Onboard it was uneventful.

We arrived at the airport 4 hours before departure. As soon as our flight was indicated, we went to the indicated counters. However, only an electronic check-in was possible there. This check-in did not provide for the possibility to check-in children belonging to the exchange program either. Therefore, we went to the counters where check-in took place physically. After a long line, we were ready to have our documents checked. Although the documents were alright, the women at the counter still had to consult her manager because she was not sure if the documents were in order. When she was back, she confirmed that the docs were alright, but said that it was too late now and the gate had already closed and would not be opened for boarding for my daughter. Despite the fact that there was still over an hour before departure and that all other airlines I have experience with close their gates just before departure, LH refused to accept my daughter. Lufthansa fails to realize that it has a contract with the passengers and that not only passengers have obligations, but also LH has and it is expected to make an effort to find a solution, in particular in a situation which does not really presents a problem. Not to mention any kind of services which is fully missing on the side of LH. All in all, I consider this procedure unacceptable. Two days before departure, I wanted to clarify one more point with LH and called LH's information desk at 23:00. According to the information on LH´s website, the support line is open until midnight. The announcement on the phone was that all the lines were overloaded and the waiting time was 20 minutes. Since the clarification was important to me, I decided to wait. After waiting until 23.50, I hung up. I think that this example about the customer orientation on the part of LH is meaningful enough and no further comments are needed.",,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Frankfurt to Vancouver,August 2021,,,,,1.0,1,no

Check-in at CDG on an August Sunday afternoon was just one long queue for all Lufthansa and Swissair flights (despite buying my ticket online, check-in via the app was disabled). Even arriving two hours in advance, you would have very little time to spare to reach the aircraft given how slow things were going (luckily I was spotted by an airline rep as having no luggage to check in and was moved to the free business counter). The A320 to Frankfurt was new and spotless. The crew went around handing out a single alcohol towelette to each passenger in a great display of hygiene/safety precautions (other airlines give you masks, gel, wipes, etc). Each passenger was given an individual bottle of mineral water  and Swiss-style chocolates. That was it, for an early evening flight. On the FRA-HKG leg, there was no choice of dish for dinner or the usual apology of ""sorry, we have run out of"" -  some penne in tomato sauce. Breakfast was very skimpish and un-German (picture).

After the trip I had contacted Lufthansa about 25 times over the phone and just about as many through their email and social media. I requested a refund back in may and was told I will receive money back in 7-10 days. I called back 3 weeks after and they was no idea what refund I was talking about, they stated that there was no ticket for a refund on my account. It took me 3 hours and 4 attempts to get a hold of a live person, since the first 3 either hung up, or put me on a 30 min hold and then hung up, the representative that work for this company have zero respect for customers time and money. I always asked very politely to not disconnect the call and to call me in case we get disconnected. Not a singe Lufthansa representative called me back after hanging up on me.

Moreover, if there is a government-imposed travel ban, they will not allow you to have refund (only rebooking, usually at a very high price because the last-minute booking is usually twice or three times the price of the original ticket). Other flight companies allow for refund, but Lufthansa is instructing their call service to deny the refunds and rebooking cannot be done online. To rebook, you need to call their call service, which is a nightmare. I tried to rebook 3 times. First time I was on hold for about an hour.

I asked one of the staff that I have a flight leaving very soon and I will miss it, is there anyway I can get to the front of the line, she said you have to wait.

I ran through the immigration and I asked the guy who worked at the immigration again if he thinks I can make it then he told me he doesn’t think so because of the gate is very far, the farthest gate it’ll take me about 10+ mins if I run (Z68).

I missed my flight while my other fellow American who ran with me said while they were told this connection flight will wait for us.

Unsurprising given most are German, but still, should be more pleasant. No meal choices. Every other airline I have ever flown has offered at least some food choice ~ meat, chicken, fish, etc. Not Lufthansa! It was pasta with tomato sauce and wasn't even tasty.

We traveled from Frankfurt to Johannesburg on flight LH572, departing on June 3 at 22.05, which lasted approximately 10 ½ hours. During this time, we experienced disrespect, rudeness, and overall unpleasant attitudes and service by some of your flight attendants. We were seated in row 32, seats G, H and K. I understand that food is limited, however, when we inquired if our daughter could have an alternate meal, the female flight attendant blurted out “Everyone has the same thing! If you wanted a special meal, you should have requested it before the flight.” That’s fine, but the insensitive and rude behavior of this flight attendant was not acceptable, by any culture! When the plane pulled into the gate at Johannesburg, the fasten seat belt sign was turned off. I stood up to stretch my legs as I am tall and my knees hurt. Again, this flight attendant shouted at me to “sit down until you are told to get up!” Is this the type of behavior that is tolerated by your airline?

On arrival to Frankfurt, I couldn't my flight from Frankfurt to brussels. I went to check this with customer service and was told there is no such flight. I was shocked about this given that my travel dates had be changed earlier by them. The woman at customer service desk was super rude. She told me that there was no such flight scheduled for Brussels at 12.00 and if there was earlier on the flight was cancelled (12.00) and that the next one was due at 21.00 and there was nothing she could do. She also told me that is is not Lufthansa's fault that the flight was cancelled and that I should have been informed about the cancellation by booking.com from where I had booked this flight. This when the exchange between us got heated and and there was raising of voices despite the fact that there were other customers in the queue. Eventually she told me that there is nothing she can do and waved me off. This really shocked me because I am sure booking.com cannot cancel the airline's flights and the responsibility of getting me to my destination is on Lufthansa. But more surprisingly, is the fact that they never bothered to contact me about this. I had to travel to my destination by train hoping to be compensated for this inconvenience. On my return to Helsinki, both flights were late again. Upon arriving in Helsinki at midnight, my suitcases went missing. Again there is no traffic during corona time so I did not understand this. Helsinki airport was a graveyard, there was no one to ask. So for one hour I just walked around the airport looking for help which I finally got and I finally filled the form. Since I arrived late in Helsinki, I had to get a hotel room and pay for taxi as there was no direct bus to Turku at that hour. The next day I spent money buying essential warm clothes. I obviously a claim form and sent an email to Lufthansa requesting for compensation for the inconveniences: canceled flight and the cost incurred during the period (6 days) my luggage was missing. When they finally got back to me, I was shocked when they said that it is not their responsibility that Lufthansa canceled my flight and therefore they will not compensate me for the train ticket. They never apologised for the late flights and time spent looking for my luggage that led to me missing the last bus to Turku. In total I had spent 315.95 euros during this period, however, they refused to compensate me the full amount and only decided on 123 euros.

On both flights (1113, MAD-FRA | 430, FRA-ORD) there were constant violations of Lufthansa's policies regarding covid-19. Many passengers were visibly not wearing masks for a long time (not just during the meals) or not wearing them properly and the crew did not do anything about it. There was also a family who wore masks so evidently inadequate (they looked like gaiters for the neck) that a flight attendant offered them surgical ones, but they were allowed to refuse these masks and continue on board! Lufthansa has to do much, much better if they really are committed to protecting their customers (and their employees!). I know it is difficult for the crew to control everything that goes on during a flight, but to be blunt, it is their responsibility and they failed their costumers who followed the rules (doing everything to avoid infecting and getting infected) miserably. I will spend the next days both terrified and angry and hoping to get another PCR done asap.

I had planned and packed carefully knowing I’m a woman going to a conservative, patriarchal country. Doesn’t matter, Lufthansa left our luggage in Frankfurt. I didn’t think too much of it to begin with because half of the time I travel international they lose my luggage. But normally they get it to us the following day or the day after at the latest. If we didn’t have 5 multilingual, wonderfully kind guides from our tour company constantly harassing Lufthansa and the airport carriers, I don’t think we’d ever see our luggage again. At first they told us to come in 2 days later before we flew from Cairo to Aswan and they’d have it for us to take with us (since they have the same flight coming in every day). It never was put on the plane. Then they tell us it will be sent to us in Aswan. We’re there for 2-3 days so they have time to get it to us before we get on our Nile Cruise. They never tried to send it to Aswan. Now we just heard we won’t get our luggage until we go back to the Cairo airport and retrieve it in person. Why? Because they honestly don’t care. They don’t think it’s their problem that we don’t have our luggage. Reminder that we’re not just in a foreign country, but in Egypt. We have a body guard assigned to us from the Egyptian government to escort us whenever we leave our hotels. “Go buy some essentials and we’ll refund you 50% of the cost.” First off, even refunding me 100% of the cost is not enough to even begin to cover this inconvenience. There’s clothes, snacks, and other items in my luggage that I bought specifically for this trip that I’ve now bought in vain because I will never use them.  I saved up money, which is precious right now during the pandemic, to come here and enjoy myself!

What a mistake ! Our return flight from Crete to Brussels on the 19th November was cancelled and the proposal we received by e-mail was a flight from Athens to Brussels. When I called their customer support the first proposal was a flight on November 30 (11 days later) leaving 6:55 in the morning and arriving 20:50 in the evening. There were flights available leaving 6:55 arriving 10:50 several times a week but we could not be booked on those because we did not have the right booking class. I was asked to call again later, maybe other options would become available. The next time I called the proposal was even better: we would leave on the 29th and arrive on the 30th (a stay in a hotel was not included). I could contact customer relations if I did not like this, which I did. The only answer I got from them was that their customer services were able to handle this problem.

When I tried to get this changed I was told that I would have to pay because I confirmed their alternative. When they were calculating the cost they ended the call so I gave up and booked a flight with another airline and got home without problems.

Later, Lufthansa infomed me the flight was cancelled. Lufthansa rebooked me to a Swiss Air flight on the 25th October from LHR to PVG. I also received the confirmation email from Lufthansa about my rebooking and it said my flight was confirmed. Today, I rang Lufthansa and the customer services told me my ticket with Swiss Air was not issued so I cannot take the flight on 25th October, the one I thought I was going to take. Then I rang Swiss Air and they told me my reservation is in their system but the ticket is still the old Lufthansa ticket for 27th October, so they cannot issue me a new ticket on the 25th flight. Meanwhile, I was told there was no Economy seat but Business and First on the 25th Swiss Air flight. But on the 1st of October, when the rebooking was incurred, there are plenty of economy seats on that flight. Besides, there are other flight options in October. Now, I was told there are no available flights in October. I'm so upset and disappointed with Lufthansa, this has totally disrupted and ruined my plans and it will cost me significantly. I have urgent business matters and I need to be in Shanghai on time. If Lufthansa did not provide me the false information and told me right at the beginning (on the 1st October) that the rebooking is not successful then I would still have other options. But today is the 6th October and there are no other flights! I called your customer services multiple times and they couldn't help me at all but just asked me to wait! This is truly absurd!

Today I called customer service in Johannesburg as there is a flight on 29/10/2020 which connects with the second leg and this was rapidly processed with no mention by the seats. The confirmatory email arrived with no seat allocation and mention of our not having seating included. I called up customer services again and was told there was a R2 difference in price per seat so they could refund the entire cost of the tickets (read as wait many months to get our money back) and rebook and pay again.

Then, less than one week before of the flight date, they cancel your booking and put you in the flight that costed the least. I arrive to my  destination at 1am in the morning without the possibility to take any public transportation.

Only after numerous attempts did I get through to Lufthansa only to be cut off in the middle of my call. I tried to call 4 or 5 more times to simply be cut off before anyone answered the call. I then tried using the Miles and More member number, I got through after just a few minutes and was helped by a courteous friendly assistant who, after 5 minutes, re-allocated the original seats. At no time did Lufthansa inform me of this change or of the fact they had seated two people on the same booking some 15 rows apart. I wrote an email to Lufthansa on 29.06 asking for an explanation on 23.07 received an automated replay that did not address my question. The seat numbers continued to change in the days leading up to the flight at least the changes were in the same area. 48 hours before the flight the screen showed that the seats ""could not be pre-booked on this leg of the journey¨ but could be selected at time of check-in? In line with an apparent Lufhansa ""Covid19 code of conduct"" during this whole seat reservation farce the seat next to a booked seat was shown as ""non-bookable"" .. an intelligent and logical move, a positive Lufthansa initiative. However on boarding the plane (after ground staff informing us the pre-booked boarding assistance was ready! I had no requested this and after a brief discussion the whole thing was dismissed with indifference and lack to interest on their part. Upon boarding to my surprise people I saw that in fact passengers were sitting in the ""non-bookable seats"" .. no Covid19 distancing as implied by Lufthansa. In addition to being incompetent during the booking and boarding process they were also lying about their ""responsible seating policy"", Additionally boarding was more chaotic than normal, people queuing in the aisles, moving from the back to the front of the plane: evidence of the Lufthansa “dynamic seating process”. During the flight the FAs handed out 3 documents in a disorganized and giggly fashion, requesting us to complete them. The request was in unclear/garbled English and German. When unable to fill out 1 form (as none of the options applied to me) I asked the FA how to proceed: she replied “I don’t know, I´m just a FA, just fill in something!”  One form was handed back to the FA, the other 2 had to be handed to the French authorities at passport control/security at Lyon arrivals. There were no officials at Lyon arrivals, no passport or security controls. One document was only valid for nationals from non-EU countries (plus UK, Norway.) The FA clearly had not understood the forms she was handing out. On the return flight I received a “Boarding Gate change” on my phone, the new gate being quoted as G26. As I was unable to find any “G” gates I asked a security guard where the G area was (no ground staff were at the original boarding area). We were then called to board (at the original gate) only to be kept standing for 15 min while the confused and theatrical ground staff gave us unclear and contradictory information.

As I read (or mis-read online) there was supposed to be a button in the online environment to click to issue a re-fund and so I did.

At the airport the frustrated Lufthansa staff confirmed the same. So we stuck in Toronto, lost our tickets and may be the chance to get back home in this crazy times. I know that these days/weeks are extremely difficult for all of us but the way how Lufthansa left our family with confirmed tickets on an other continent showing no interest of finding any solution for us - this is very disappointing.

I´ve asked him what the solution would have been and he didn´t have any information regarding it, therefore as I had to go back to Vienna due to work business I asked him to rebook me to any flight within the star alliance airlines, and he mentioned just the possibility to fly via Brussels, although there was still a spare place via Zurich with SWISS. I received an Email confirmation with my flight to Belgium with Brussels airlines and proceeding with an Austrian Airlines flight to Vienna. I wanted to check- in online but on Brussels airlines it was not possible, but for the flight with AUA yes. I was a bit concerned, but I thought due to the strike this could have been normal. I arrived a bit earlier to the airport and at the check-in counter by giving them my documents their answer was “we don´t have any flight booked under your name” I was very furious as it was looking like there would have not been any solution to fly back on that day. I had to talk to other three people, until someone could have started helping me out for it, the only supervisor for five star alliance in an international airport… ridiculous, and neither from the airline but from the group S.A.V.E., company operating in Venice airport. They had to call several times, many Lufthansa desks until they told me they would have had to rebook me on a flight via Zurich (the one I´ve seen the day before, but which was never offered to me…) It was a kind of realizing news they gave me, although I was stuck at the airport for about 4 hours as it was way much earlier my scheduled flight to Brussels.

The flight was on time, and as expected it was the usual professional, polite but non engaging service on board. As it was a midday flight, a cold lunch/snack and warm bread was served, along with drinks. Comfort wise, there is no difference between Economy and Business seats. The seat pitch is the same, and though the empty middle seat offers more space, considering this is just an hour flight, it did not make any difference. The experience on the outbound journey in Economy and return on Business was just the same except for the food and bar service.

Despite the connection in Frankfurt (I was coming in from London), I find this flight more enjoyable than some other alternatives. On boarding, I was offered the usual nonalcoholic welcome drink, and we were away on time. Once the bar service was opened, I opted for a scotch on ice, but with a half litre bottle opened, I got a very small drink served! That was followed by a tasty lunch, wine, and I settled down to watch a movie on the IFE. The choice here is a very limited (compared to the likes of Emirates). On my return flight, which was late night, the service started with drinks and a delicious beef sandwich. 90 minutes before arrival a bland breakfast was served consisting of omelet and cold items. The seating on Premium Economy is very comfortable (2x3x2). The usual water bottle and small amenity kit was also provided. But as I was at a window seat, stepping out to use the toilet was difficult, especially as the passenger in the front seat had his seat reclining. My fellow passenger had to get off his seat to let me out.

Soon after take off, unlike some other European airlines, a pastry snack and drink was swiftly served. Service, was formal, non-engaging, but quite adequate. However, on landing we had to be moved to a far away parking slot and it incurred a long bus ride, and further rail ride to the actual allocated terminal area.

To be short, the service was terrible. Stewards never offered to warm bottles, never bothered to check or ask how we were doing and when we did ask for some hot water it was given very abruptly. After only 2.5hrs of a 9.5 hour flight the cabin lights were turned off completely. This was not a red eye flight so I have no idea why this was done. When I got up to stretch and stand I was told within 2 minutes to go and sit down by the rudest stewardess I have ever encountered. She also badgered other passengers throughout the flight. There was also no safety briefing at the start of the flight and all the announcements were so garbled you couldn’t understand what they were saying, in German or English. There was no offer of assistance while de-planing and no offer of assistance in regards to where we go next for our next flight. Once we arrived in Frankfurt we were almost run over (literally) by a golf cart doing at least 15-20mph! We had to walk almost 2km to get to out next gate and when we went to the Lufthansa service desk for directions there was no one around (of course).

When we arrived at the check in they said they had overbooked and if we could volunteer to go on another flight (KLM) leaving at the same time. I figured no harm so I ran to the other side of the airport only to be told by KLM that we had not been booked on that flight and that the gate was closed. So we had to run back all the way to Lufthansa to then be told they could get us on our original flight. In form of “compensation” they offered us €250 each and put us up in a hotel with a shuttle bus from the airport. But like the previous promise of another flight, the shuttle was non existent so we ended up paying for taxis out of pocket. Next day when we arrived early to follow the given instructions about the compensation once again, no one knew anything and everything they told us was wrong. The only thing we could do was file a claim online. Of course this is a very convenient way of not dealing with customers. I called and was told if I wanted to make a reservation of course I could talk to someone, but if I have a complaint that can only be done online, nice way of avoiding responsibility and not facing your many unhappy passengers. We filed the claims, I sent all the required emails and have received no reply. I am very frustrated with what I consider to be lies and lack of responsibility.

"""Senator Lounge is in free fall""",6,Harun Rathore,10th October 2019,"✅ Trip Verified | I flew from Berlin to Tivat via Frankfurt on 6 October in Business Class. The Senator Lounge in Berlin is in free fall. There was a lot of talk about the new Senator Lounge. In the end, the new one is worse than the old one. The choice of food and drinks is very limited. For breakfast, there used to be at least three choices of cold cuts and cheese; now, it is one each. The croissants are gone, the toast has gone, there is only one kind of sliced bread. There is no free champagne anymore, the alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks selection has suffered considerably. Shame on Lufthansa for giving such a bad impression in their lounges in the German capital. The departure from Berlin was 30 minutes delayed because of the late arrival of the incoming aeroplane. However, the announcement was only made when it was already time for the pre-boarding announcement. As I was in a good position overlooking the apron, I knew that the aeroplane had not even come yet, but, to many other passengers, this came as a most unpleasant surprise, as a lot of them seemed to have short connection times in Frankfurt. The aeroplane left with a delay of more than 30 minutes; the flight itself was quite good. In Business Class, they served a tray containing a plate with slices of roast chicken, vegetables and pesto, accompanied by some bread rolls with butter as well as some panna cotta with cherry sauce and clotted cream. For me, there was enough connecting time in Frankfurt, as I knew exactly how I could get from Terminal 1 to Terminal 2 quickly. I spent some 20 minutes in the Senator Lounge. It was quite empty for that time of day. The food served reflected the fact that the Oktoberfest in Munich had started. It was all very Bavarian – the same you get in the Munich lounges all year round. Within the 50 minutes I was in Frankfurt, the departure gate changed at least four times from B30 to B20 to B27 and finally to B28. The flight from Frankfurt to Tivat was the real disappointment. The flight was more than twice as long as the inner-German flight from Berlin to Frankfurt, but the food served on board to Tivat was exactly the same as on the previous flight. I mean how is this possible? How can it be that Lufthansa – a so-called 5-star airline – offers the same kind of food on two different flights at two different times of day with different flight duration? Frankfurt is Lufthansa‘s main hub; the vast majority of the passengers have connecting flights here. Is that the impression Lufthansa tries to leave? Austrian, a Lufthansa-group member, is able to serve a hot meal on all international flights no matter how long it is. Why is the parent company, Lufthansa, not able (or willing?) to do the same?",A320/A319,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Berlin to Tivat via Frankfurt,October 2019,3.0,4.0,3.0,,3.0,3,yes

Now, before I took this flight with my dog I made sure the flight will be the most comfortable as possible for her. The rules are that dogs can fly in cabin as long as they are secured in their carrier during take off and landing and when the seatbelt light goes off the dog is allowed to sit in your lap. I asked the rules several times before traveling because she hates being in a carrier and goes crazy barking and crying. I even got her tranquilizers from the vet just for her to be able to deal with those few minutes she has to be in the carrier. This is the way we traveled to Europe a few weeks ago. Nice and smooth she made it thru.  Lufthansa banned me from flying their airline because my dog, who came out of her carrier by poking her head out, mid flight and was barking! This pilot demanded At the beginning of the flight to keep her in the carrier the whole flight and told me that that is the rules. My poor dog hates being in the carrier, I probably would’ve not brought her if that was really the rule because she barks and cries when she’s in the carrier. I asked the pilot why he would not use his own discretion with his rules, for my dog will make the whole plane crazy by barking while being locked in a small box. It’s the rules.  I did what he told me anyway and my dog barked for 25 minutes straight while I apologized to the other passengers.

"""seat is narrow and offers no privacy""",2,Dagmara Walkowicz,19th September 2019,"Not Verified |  Really disappointed with Lufthansa business class seat. Its a joke for which one pays a premium price. The seat is narrow and offers no privacy whatsoever. I found it very hard and uncomfortable. When it was fully flat I felt like I was in bed with a strange man as there was a stranger seated next to me and I was lying so close to him. The distance between the seats is almost like economy class, there is no privacy divider of any sort. When in seating mode, there was not enough space for my arm and I kept hitting my neighbour with my elbow. There is also no storage space to put things into. All my stuff ended up on the floor by the window. I have never seen a worse business class seat, ever. The flight was full and perhaps because of that the service was not good, either. The cabin attendants looked harrased and did not smile, it was difficult to to get a drink as they were busy with a full cabin, it took a long time for them to respond and then I felt like a nuisance asking for a glass of orange juice. Despite bad service, the food was good. Also, the in-flight entertainment was easy to use and had a lot of choice in English. But the seat is most important to me so I will never fly Lufthansa in long-haul business class ever again unless forced to. I cannot believe that an airline with such bad business class product can be a 5-star airline. Avoid.",A340-600,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Munich to New York,November 2018,1.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1,no

Hardly time to visit the toilet and certainly not opportunity to go into the Lounge. At the boarding gate I asked about my luggage and I was reassured by the staff, after checking the computer, that it had been transferred successfully to the second plane. After boarding the plane, lunch time, we were informed that there was no catering service at all due to the recurrent issue that they have had .. for over 2 months now. But being served just a wafer is totally unacceptable, they didn't make even the effort to get us a sandwich despite departing from their main hub. Credit must be given to the crew on board as they had to put up with this situation for not fault of their own but because of the incompetence and unprofessionalism of the company. To add insult to the injury my luggage didn't make it to the second plane and it was still in Frankfurt (despite being an easier journey through the airport than mine) so I had to spend another 25 extra minutes to go through the queue and forms at the baggage handling company desk in Madrid. I had to beg then for having it express delivered on that night (only Senators and HON members are entitled to such privilege) despite being Star Alliance Gold and Lufthansa Frequent Flyer. Fortunately the staff took pity of me and they managed to get it approved by Lufthansa. Needless to say that I sent the feedback form to customer services on the very same night. I requested for someone to call me as soon as possible.

I have chosen this airline for many years as a family friendly airline and for its reputation. Unfortunately when I traveled this time it was a total disaster leading me to write this review. I consider myself a frequent flyer, having done this trip over twenty times but never with an infant. I have a multitude of complaints including complete disregard from crew and personnel, unsanitary conditions on the flight and rude service. I am extremely disappointed and will never choose this company again after paying $1700 for this roundtrip ticket. First, I paid extra for a special seat to accommodate my daughter and I and found myself in the middle row. I understand that I chose to have her in my lap as these were the only options given to me during booking. Secondly, the staff in economy was extremely rude and unaccommodating to our situation and even refused us a bottle of water. Thirdly, the conditions in the plane were a disgrace. People were throwing up in the aisle, multiple passengers had their bare feet on the seat rests and television monitors with no consideration for others and the crew did nothing to remedy this. I was horrified at the thought of changing my infants diaper in the bathroom under these conditions. Lastly, no one showed any consideration or patience while aware that I was carrying an infant, a stroller and two carry-ons while boarding and deplaning and no one offered a seat on the bus that brought us twice to two different terminals forcing us to stand and trying not to loose our balance. I understand that I am not in control of the behavior of others, but the crew showed complete indifference towards this and lacked complete empathy for the passengers on this flight and my daughter and I. I believe that the crew's lack of care reinforced an atmosphere of total indifference.

"""would not be my first choice""",2,J Aberg,25th July 2019,"✅ Trip Verified |  Copenhagen to Los Angeles via Frankfurt. I have found Lufthansa becoming more and inconsistent in their performance. On the first leg, we had secured nice exit seats with plenty of leg space, to be told at the gate that we had instead been upgraded to business class. However, this is is the first time in 25 years of travel that I get an upgrade, and the service offering is a down-grade. First off, the seat pitch is less than in economy class (compared to the exit seats we had). Then, it turns out that there is not enough business class catering, so  we each get a KitKat snack to keep us happy. Suffice to say that If I can afford to pay more than 1000 USD for a ticket, I can afford to buy an unhealthy snack for 50 cents. The purser expressed that she was ""sorry"". I acknowledge her statement, but I would much more appreciate her fixing the problem. The long-haul portion of the trip was average. The IFE and power supply did not work for me and the people sitting next to me, and it took the crew hours to figure this out. I had ordered Lufthansa's a la carte dining, which has been very good in the past. Today, parts of the meal were very unattractive. I cannot believe that they have the heart to charge 30 EUR for a rip-off of this sort. A final observation from the long-haul part was that we spent almost an hour holding at the tarmac at LAX, after landing, before finally arriving at our gate This was handled very poorly by the cabin team. I was for instance able to get off the plane before almost all premium passengers. In conclusion, not Lufthansa's finest day, by far. Would I fly them again?

"""I was not allowed in""",1,D Calikiene,23rd July 2019,"✅ Trip Verified |  Istanbul to Munich with Turkish Airlines connecting to Poznan with Lufthansa. Our experience started on the way back when I tried to check in online. I couldn't do it as booking code I got by email was not applicable for Turkish airlines. When I contacted via FB Turkish Airlines I was asked to contact travel agency and get another booking code. Second proposal was to call international customer line. Not working processes should be airlines responsibility and customer service shouldn’t send me back and force but should take responsibility and manage by them self. After few hours communication in FB we decided to check in the airport before flight. Early check-in was important to us because we wanted to get seats on the first row to be able to leave plane ASAP to catch another flight because we had 50 min between flights. So we were proactive and wanted to do the best. In the airport representative of Turkish airlines was surprised that FB client support were not able to check-in and told us that customer service people can see another booking number which was needed to check in (clients are not able to see). I am not angry that situations like this happens, I am angry that nobody from Turkish Airlines wants to listen customer experience and move even one finger to improve they processes and client service. And day by day everything goes worst. Instead of asking to share feedback and send to responsible people to take a look what is wrong everyone is shaking heads. So my try to share my experience in Istanbul airport was unsuccessful. At least I was able to check in and we got seats in the 8 row. But luggage was sent instead of Poznan to Munich. Probably she had already feeling that we will not reach Poznan tonight? Lucky we saw that on time and we asked them to redirect our luggage to Poznan. And for sure the Turkish Airlines flight from Istanbul to Munich was later then planned. We asked flight attendants if they can contact people on the gate and ask to wait. We asked passengers in the plane to let us go first to be faster. When we reached the bus to go to another terminal we asked bus driver if he would be able to contact gate and ask to wait 5 min (because we had to wait 5 min for bus schedule). Answer was no we cant so we had to wait. When reached Terminal number 2 we ran as crazy (maybe somebody could explain me why?). And I came to the gate 6 min late, and plane was still there.

Firstly at the start of my trip, I almost missed my flight to Denmark from Frankfurt as my flight from Heathrow (Lufthansa) was delayed which made me have to run through the airport to catch the last bus to my flight (I must also add that I have asthma and needed to constantly use my inhaler during the process of running to catch my flight. On my return from Denmark to London I experienced yet another delayed flight except this time it was from Denmark to Frankfurt. By the time we were meant to be boarding the plane, it had only just landed. Once we touched down in Frankfurt it was already time to board my next flight to Heathrow. Other flights had a minibus to take them directly to their next flight, however, Heathrow did not. The gate for Heathrow was announced once we landed which we were told it was B41, this was a gate change from the initial gate which was B20. Once we had finally got off the bus, I and a few others had rushed out following the correct signage. I eventually made it to B41 which I was then told that the gate has moved to B47 which I then had to rush off to. I think that this is extremely unacceptable as this is now the second occurrence in the space of 4 days, and I am sure that this didn’t just happen on the 2 days that I experienced it, this is a continuous occurrence and something needs to be done to eliminate or even minimize this issue.

Lufthansa prides themselves to deliver what is called Signature Service in Business Class which means that every Business Class passenger gets assigned a personal flight assistant who is supposed to introduce her/himself to you after boarding. Ours did nothing of that sort. When I asked her, her response was a counter-question whether I would be missing something. Great service attitude indeed. We have been sitting in row 15 on the A380 (upper deck) which is separated by sort of a curtain from rows 10-14 despite all rows are supposed to be Business Class. As a consequence, we were entitled to watch how passengers in rows 10-14 were looked after by their personal flight attendants while we didn't get anything. We felt like being in sort of a second class of Business Class. I don't know whether this is common on LH flights on the A380 but it is unacceptable.  When the service finally started, we found out that other passengers got offered a salad between the started and the main course while we again heard nothing about it.

The service was just outstanding and ground staff made sure we were reseated next to each other (it was not possible during online check-in).

Both dishes were really good and were met by a good selection of drinks. The seats in Business Class are full-flat on the A330 and offered a comfortable night sleep.

"""All-in-all, nice flights""",7,D Garnor,10th June 2019,"✅ Trip Verified |  Budapest to Oslo via Munich. I have mixed feelings about LH's business product. The check-in was ok (this time the BUD 2A terminal was totally empty, nobody was at the LH business check-in desk), the fast track security was ok, but the next step, the lounge was not ok. LH uses the Celebi Platinum Lounge at BUD, and the standard is around middle! Food selection is poor, quality is bad, there is no warm food at all, snack and sweet selection is pretty bad too, so I'd say this looks like rather a premium economy level lounge. I don't know if Celebi or LH upgrades or checks this lounge, but it would need a definite upgrade, cause for the business class ticket price, it was a disappointment. The boarding was ok both at BUD and MUC. On board, it is also a bit strange. The seat is not a business seat, it is an economy seat, only the middle seat left empty, but this is the only good thing one can say about LH's biz class seat. No bigger legroom, no bigger recline comparing to economy. The food is ok, there is no warm food, not even for a MUC-OSL route. The dessert was fine though (in fact it was better than the main course), and the tea was served in a ceramic cup. Bread was ok, butter was ok, though there was no hot towel. The pursers on both routes were kind and helpful. The Lufthansa business lounge in MUC was super, that one would have to be copy-pasted to BUD! And of course, it was nice to have the possibility to check-in two baggage (which this time I did) and to go on board with two handbags (which this time I did).

However, they’re still pretty good, and have a 2x3x2 configuration, unlike the stingy 2x4x2 for Singapore Airlines in premium which we also experienced. We feel that premium economy is really what ordinary economy should be like — you shouldn’t have to jam yourself in to ever tighter spaces, but today’s aircraft are getting worse in that regard. Lufthansa’s offering is one of the best in premium economy, comparing favorably with Air NZ and easily beating Singapore Airlines.

Flights were on time, FA's were friendly and attentive, and IFE exceeded expectations. I slept as much as I ever have on international flights. Sure, there is no PE class on connecting flights, and the distances between gates in FRA are quite long, but I did not see these as major issues. The basic product LH offered really worked for me. The fundamental issue was whether the extra cost for PE is worth it. After seeing that the incremental cost above economy was significant, I would say that it is not worth it. Extra leg room, food served on china, and an amenity kit are, in my book, not worth hundreds of dollars. I realize others may see this differently, but I could not justify the extra cost.

The aircraft operator has been changed (from Lufthansa to Sun Express) We then called Lufthansa to ask what and below is the response. First call we are told the flight had been moved to a different airline and we should contact them directly (Sun Express) and that Lufthansa cannot help us any further despite us booking directly with Lufthansa.  2nd call were told that this is a Lufthansa flight but this plane is not listed on there website as an aircraft used. The operator then said it was a different operator and I asked if there are any alternatives. The operator booked us on a later flight same day this time with Lufthansa.

Lufthansa (And Frankfurt airport) in general is a great airline to fly, with good planes, well maintained, great staff, clean, courteous, and efficient operations. The challenge is their digital experience.  For an airline this large, I am shocked at how bad their web sites and APPS are. The speed is so slow that I feel I am back in the days of dial-up service. They seem to have layered so many pages on top of one another, that when you click on a button, you wait 10 to 15 seconds for the next page to load. Then, when you think you have it loaded, some other layer loads on top, and moves the screen so you have to search for what you were just doing. I recently booked a simple flight from Frankfurt to Valencia, and it took me over 30 minutes to book online. I then tried the APP - couldn't eventually book it in the APP because I kept getting kicked out. I don't know if this is because of internet security requirements, or whether it is because the people that designed the Lufthansa internet and APPS are incompetent.  It makes me want to fly other airlines. KLM's web experience is quick and easy. ",A320,Business,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Valencia,April 2019,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3,no

This time I spent a little more money for an economy ticket on Lufthansa but I was disappointed. I was flying on a rather new Airplane (B747-8) but Lufthansa seems to be using old  seats in this plane. The Infotainment system has tiny screens and is super unresponsive. The touchscreen often registers your tap in a different location. Food: The food quality is ok but below the standard of other airlines. It is obvious that Lufthansa is trying to cut some costs. For example my meal included a salad that only had the leaf in it, no tomato or other vegetables that usually belong in a salad. For my chicken I thought they served me tofu because it was just some white cubes of something dumped into some sauce without even bothering to mix them together. Lastly for breakfast I was served the main dish, a yogurt an a roll. That is alright but I would have wished for some fruit to be served along with it like other airlines do. The service is good but when the staff accidentally bumps into you or spills something they just pretend like nothing happened.

"""boarding was a total mess""",5,R Jano,19th February 2019,"✅ Trip Verified | Miami to Munich. How Lufthansa is a 5 star airline has always baffled me but this time I really got the confirmation. I will not blame them for the 3 hours we spent on the plane before departing on our outwards trip (MUC-MIA), there was heavy snowfall in Munchen and we had to wait for the runways to be cleared and the plane to be deiced. However, during those 3 hours there was no service at all. I wasn't expecting much, but a glass of water would have been nice though. Now, the A380s cabin is seriously outdated. And even though it's clear that the plane we flew on recently underwent a C-check, being repainted in the new livery, the didn't bother retrofitting the cabin, so you get a 10 year old in-flight entertainment system. The touch screen barely works, it's slow to respond and responds only to every 3rd of 4th command. And on the inbound leg (MIA-MUC) the control keys (volume, channel, reading lights) didn't work at all. The IFE also froze and reset several times. On the outbound flight some passengers had the IFE not working at all and although they announced on the PA systems that they reset it several times, it didn't solve the problem. We also landed with the cabin light on (they should have been turned down) due to the same electrical problem. The seats are quite uncomfortable and the pitch in economy is just bearable and there are large metal containers protruding in the leg area. I have flown on low cost airlines which had the same seat pitch. There were no amenity kits provided, which if I'm not mistaken, should be provided by a 5 star airline, even in economy (I have flown on ones that do). The food is also nothing to brag about, it's half decent but certainly expected more from such a prestigious airline. On our backward trip the crew arrived late (but again, not their fault since there was an accident and a traffic jam), however the boarding process was a total mess. People aligned according to their seat numbers, but then they decided to randomly close lanes and just board people wherever. There wasn't even a boarding announcement, just for first and business class. When they started boarding Economy and Economy Premium they just opened two random lanes. This meant that no one really knew what's going on and the random boarding made the boarding time unnecessarily long for such a large plane (people in the back which should have been first ended up waiting for people in the front to sit down, who should have been boarded last). The crew however is pleasant, smiles and does a good job. The pilots also seemed professional and seemed to have everything under control, despite quite rough turbulence at times. At least this time our bags arrived safe, this is a miracle for Lufthansa since they managed to break 2 trolleys on my previous flights. In conclusion, definitely not a 5 star airline and regret choosing them over the other 5 star airline with which I could have flown (despite the fact that my flight time to MIA would have been an hour longer since they operate from a different hub and would have had other connecting flights).",A380-800,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Miami to Munich,February 2019,3.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1,no

"""horrible post-flight service""",1,Dennis Campbell,26th January 2019,"✅ Trip Verified |  The complaint is not with the flight itself but rather with horrible post-flight service. And attitude. Snowstorm in Europe. Budapest departure delayed. Thus missed connecting LH MUC-DEN flight. Rebooked LH MUC-ORD-DEN. 2-hour wait. Boarded LH MUC-DEN. Told we had to wait at gate for people arriving from Greece. LH MUC-ORD departure thus delayed nearly 2 hours. Long time to sit on the plane. Thus, missed UA ORD-DEN connecton. At LH service desk in ORD, discovered my wife had been booked by MUC LH on LH ORD-LAX, not ORD-DEN. LH ORD told us only choice was to take AA flight next morning to DEN. As that was the only choice that LH offered, we accepted. LH put us up in a distant rather basic hotel. Arrived at AA (Terminal 3) early next morning to check in. Long line. Denied boarding. AA said LH incorrectly booked our AA tickets. We have to go to LH in Terminal 1 to sort it out. Thus missed AA flight. Arrived at LH in Terminal 1 and told they would not open for 8 hours. Went to UA, they tried to help. There was a UA flight at 8.45 to DEN. Why didnt LH book us on that instead of AA. UA called LH to get OK to write the ticket (Hey, Star Alliance, right?). LH agrees but disconnected before transaction completed. UA agent calls again. Starts to tell story, disconnect. Calls again, starts to tell story, disconnect. Finally he is able to tell the story and again request OK to issue ticket. LH says: NO! No? Yes, no. You have to go back to AA (Terminal 3) and ask AA to reissue the ticket to UA. But, wait, there is no valid AA ticket. That is the problem. In any event, if we go back to AA, we will miss the UA flight. So I buy the tickets, and I will ask LH to reimburse. UA prints out receipt and says surely LH will reimburse. After all, if the LH agent in ORD had been paying attention, he would have issued a ticket on UA and not AA in the first place.

"""isn't worth the money we spent""",7,Cheryl Lum,26th November 2018,"Not Verified |  San Francisco to Munich. First time my son and I decided to try flying in Premium Economy as we were flying with Lufthansa. In short, it isn't worth the money we spent. It was more comfortable than flying in Economy for the extra legroom, but it's nothing special. Differences between Economy and PE are that the meals are served on chinaware and one sits 55 plus rows in front of Economy, there is a complimentary bottle of water included as well as a small amenity kit with typical items. The kit has 'Cerruti 1861' on it not Lufthansa and was just okay. They serve a pre-flight drink (only orange juice) which I think should be varied. The drinks they serve with snacks or with meals are not individual mini wine bottles but from a large bottle. British Airways and Air France serve wine in individual mini bottles so prefer that better. The service was fine. We had very friendly flight attendants both on the outbound and inbound flights. Food was tasty. However, there are just two choices: Meat dish or pasta. And the portions are as small as a frozen meal. Everything was tiny from the tray to the chinaware. Bread rolls were at least warm but again tiny. The flight attendants put out snacks in the galley but one had to either know beforehand to expect them or just happen to walk past the toilets then notice them as there was no announcement made nor on the menu they handed out. However, the choices were either crackers, Lindt chocolates, and juices and water. Seating as mentioned above is roomy for legroom and a tiny bit widthwise. I found it problematic to recline. In fact, I could not figure out how to do so. And the tray table is folded so it is a bit of a nuisance to unfold and fold it back into the arm rest. If I weren't sitting next to my son I'd need to ask my seat mate if I could disturb them as this tray table folding/unfolding experience necessitated bothering one's seat mate's arm rest too. Worst part of the experience is that the toilets were only two for the entire PE section and they were filthy. Plus the crew seem to be stingy on toilet roll replacing. In fact, they only have one toilet roll from the beginning of the flight. Sometimes it ran out with no replacement timely. Also hand soap ran out and it took some time for them to refill it. I've flown British Airways and Air France which have bad aspects, however, at least their flight attendants were always replacing missing toiletry items regularly during the long flight. This was a connecting flight between Munich and Rome. Hated that we were not told that upon arrival in Rome we'd be landing on the tarmac and would need to take a shuttle bus to the terminal. It was cold and windy and frankly hard to maneuver the steps from the plane for me. Would hate to have an infant and/or small children in tow. All in all, I'd have to think hard if I want to spend another $2K for Lufthansa's PE in future. I just didn't feel it was worthwhile as it was not much different from sitting in Economy. In fact, they make it known that you're really in Economy as you have no special boarding privileges either; you enter with all of the Economy passengers.",A380-800,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,San Francisco to Munich,November 2018,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2,yes

Seated next to me was a gentleman that seemed not able to do anything for himself; he couldn’t pick up his napkin directly before his feet, he couldn’t replace the tray back in its pocket rest, he couldn’t turn on the entertainment set, and a few other annoying things that I would have protested in doing myself. However, this young lady despite the challenges held her resolve and “passed the test” literally speaking. She was not to be rattled by such behaviour. She went about her duties in methodic manner and executed her service in a timely and professional manner. No running back and forth servicing one passenger at a time, or forgetting this or that. Beverages and meals were served expeditiously and very professionally; the clean-up service after meals was no exception.

I asked if the luggage had to be picked up in Beijing and re-boarded to CKG, I did not receive conclusive information in Hanover and at the boarding gate in Munich. The lady at the boarding gate in Munich has looked in the PC, but she was not able to give a conclusive answer. She just gave the advice to ask in Beijing! On my objection that I do not speak Chinese, she said that at the jetway when leaving the plane there are always someone with English language skills. That was not the case. Then, as a precaution, I waited for my suitcase on the luggage belt, which then came. The food of the flight section MUC-PEK can be classified as problematic. The first leg of the return flight, which I took with my wife, was done by Air China. The first leg was delayed by 1:40 hours due to fog in CKG. We had to fear for our connection in Shanghai, because an airport change from Shanghai Hongqiao to Pudong (around 60 km) was necessary. When we made our online booking only a terminal change was indicated for Shanghai. Later it was changed in an airport change. Air China was unable to obtain any assistance because of the delay. Then there was an altercation at the check-in CKG because of the number of luggage (2 pieces each 23 kg per person). Air China wanted to carry only 1 piece with 20 kg/person. Furthermore, it was forgotten to enter the passport number on my wife's boarding pass, as soon as the next trouble occurred at the security checkpoint.

The European flights offered a sandwich with beer/wine/soft drinks, few airlines offer any complimentary service on short-haul flights, so that was nice. My biggest complaint would be that en-route to Kiev, my suitcase was destroyed at Frankfurt airport so I had to buy a new one upon arrival in Kiev. Also, my VIE-FRA connection was too short to be comfortable, 45 minutes to connect at a huge airport like Frankfurt is really stressful. I just barely made it to the gate a few minutes before they closed the doors. My already short connection was made even shorter due to the fact that the flight from Vienna landed what seemed like several miles from the actual terminal, and we were then treated to a 15-minute bus tour of Frankfurt airport, so I ended up literally having to run all the way to my next gate. Overall, I'd still fly LH again, they're still better than any USA-based airline, as well as better than many European ones, but as a supposed 5-star carrier, they really need to improve the food on long-haul flights, work out the glitches in the entertainment system, and take better care of passengers' luggage.",Boeing 747-800,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Kiev Boryspil/Vienna via Frankfurt,August 2018,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3,yes

I sent this note to customer service because of the sweetheart that helped me get home. After a delayed flight from Sofia to Frankfurt, I missed my connection back to Florence which in and of itself would not be a problem if I did not have another flight the very next day from Rome to Bangkok, ironically connecting in Frankfurt again. The flight was not on the same booking as I had taken a last minute trip to Bulgaria and felt comfortable giving myself one day in Florence before my flight back to Bangkok. What would have been a few busy days of traveling quickly turned into a nightmare. After a long walk to terminal B to the transfer counter, which I could not find and was not clearly marked, me and hundreds of other frustrated and tired customers got in line. Standing there I realized that I could potentially miss my return flight to Bangkok the next day because of a one hour delay; my best laid plans were ruined. As I inched forward slowly to the front of the line, I could see the agitated groups of people huffing and puffing about their misfortune. I started to feel a tinge of panic too. Standing in the very front I looked at the flashing number and approached the counter. I was greeted with a welcoming smile and cheerful voice. Already an amazing feat as far as I was concerned seeing the amount of verbal abuse that was going on at the counters while I was waiting. This immediately put me more at ease. I explained my predicament: If the earliest flight from Frankfurt to Florence landed at 9:30, I would not get home to get my other bag and drop off the keys to my friend's apartment until at least 10:30, it's a 30 minute walk to the train station and a taxi is not much quicker then I would have to hope there was a train right away. If my some twist of fate I got an 11:15 train, I'd be at Rome central station at 12:45 and then have to hope again there was a coinciding train to the airport just at that moment which would get me there around 1:30pm for a 2:55pm flight and that is if absolutely everything went my way carrying two pieces of luggage in the hot August sun. Maybe some daredevils think that is plenty of time but I'm a traveler that arrives 3 hours early for every flight. Just thinking about that time frame was causing me stress. The friendly woman behind the counter listened and empathized with a smile. She could have just told me that even though both flights were with Lufthansa because they were on different bookings that there was nothing she could do. She could have politely told me that the 8:30am flight was the best she could do or brushed off my concerns and turned her attention to the hundreds of people behind me.

First, I couldn’t even check in online because they asked me for a visa/permit to enter Germany, which wasn’t even my final destination? I have a Hong Kong passport, not China and I don’t need visa for schengen. They saw my ticket was for 5 months, so asked to see proof of my “residency permit” in Sweden. I showed them the letter from the Swedish migration agency, which obviously is mostly in Swedish, but they did not consider it enough or readable.  Eventually, I managed to get past the counter via showing the Swedish school’s acceptance letter. The only reason I gave 3/10 and not 1/10 is because of their air crew and service, which is good, and one of the ground personnel who knew German and helped me out a bit with the translation and arguing to let me pass.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Stockholm via Munich,August 2018,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,2,no

I would have expected the ground crew to offer some information and explanation to the lined-up passengers. This did not happen. We were just left to stand in line for 30 minutes. Part of that time was spent uncomfortably in the jet bridge. When I politely asked a member of the ground crew to explain what was happening, I was rebuked for my impertinence. Even stranger, during the flight there was no mention of the delay, as though this were perfectly normal. Service on board was acceptable.

We had a bit of hope that it would be fixed in 10 minutes, but after we were told that the luggage is on the carousel, we went back to the check-in desk again.

Economy class booked through Lufthansa website, with advance seat selection. YVR-FRA 10-hour intercontinental segments were mainline LH flights using Boeing 747-400s. YYJ-YVR 20-minute connecting flights by Air Canada used Dash 8-Q400 turboprops. FRA-GVA 1¼-hour connecting flights were an A-319 and a CRJ-700. I customarily book in Lufthansa's Premium Economy, but their 747s have only four rows of seats and the only PE seats left were in the front bulkhead row, which aren't worth the cost. (In that front row, although you have extra knee room, you can't stretch out your legs fully because there are no seats in front of you.) As well, in the armrest you have not only the tray table but also the IFE screen, which is half the size of screens in other PE seats. So I booked regular economy class. My seats were 49A outbound and 48K on the return. Booking those window seats cost Can$49 each way and were worth it, as they let you stretch out your legs fully under the seat in front of you. FAs were very good. Two meals were served, the main one after take-off, the second 90 minutes before landing. The meals were LH's two standard economy stodge options – vegetarian pasta or chicken. The second meal was an omelette before midday arrival at FRA, and beef stew or pasta before afternoon arrival at YVR. Connections as offered on LH website were tight, about two hours each way through FRA. Nevertheless, my luggage arrived with me both times. The only hitch was that LH and AC use different booking codes.

The food is decent, drinks plentiful, and seats are about as comfortable (uncomfortable) as you would expect. Lots of in-flight entertainment options, which is good. The way back through Munich was a mess. For whatever reason we couldn't check in online. We called and were told we could check in at the airport the next morning at the airport to get our boarding passes, then do the same again once we were in Munich. This went OK for the first short flight, but horrible for the connection. The Lufthansa service desk in Munich wouldn't print our passes and sent us to the gate without alerting anyone. Lufthansa has an extra security check-in before the gate, and those employees didn't want to let us through without a boarding pass. This resulted in about twenty minutes of additional delay with three other confused Lufthansa employees. We finally made it to the gate where we were then reprimanded by another Lufthansa employee for being late for boarding. She refused to sit my husband and I together (?), so we were placed in separate aisles. Once on board the flight, the seat I had been given was in between a woman and her two children. She asked me to move, which I did. The row behind my husband's assigned seat was almost empty, so we ended up sitting there together.

While Miles&More Senators/HON and Lufthansa Business Class customers are allowed to use the DB Lounge at Cologne Central Station, this service is not provided to Star Alliance Gold customers. Still, I find the 50-minutes train ride from downtown Cologne to Frankfurt a very convenient alternative compared to flying. What I do not like is that there are no check-in agents at Cologne Station anymore – they have been replaced by a check-in machine. So it is not possible to make changes to the ticket: No change of flights, seats, frequent traveller card or APIS when flying to the US. Security at Frankfurt was very quick and I went directly to the lounge closest to my departure gate in the A terminal (A30). It was a business class lounge and had a really good selection of food and I nice tarmac view. It even had showers (which I did not use). I found it better that the Senator Lounges. The flight from FRA to CPH was fully booked in Economy, so no free middle seat. Nice crew, a bite to eat and two drink services (1h15m flight!). All in all a good experience.

We were not proactively offered anything (drink, etc) on flight ATH-MUC, the curtain between Business and Economy was left open for most of the flight, with the result that the Business class lavatory was used by people from Economy. None of the cabin crew tried to stop them. Surely one of the benefits of flying a Business class cabin is to have a dedicated bathroom? The boarding process was chaotic - any notion of priority boarding was a joke. On 1 flight by the time we boarded, other passengers had filled the storage space. Since we were seated at seats 2D and 2F, where we had no option but to store everything in the overhead lockers, I believe that someone should have made sure that people on the other rows stored things under the middle (empty) seats. To his credit, the steward very kindly helped us find a solution - no pre-flight drinks were offered, on one flight no menus were offered. We were offered a choice of ""meat"" or ""paella"".

"""Worst A380 layout I have flown""",4,Sid Vinyard,28th June 2018,"✅ Trip Verified |  Houston to Moscow via Frankfurt. Worst A380 layout I have flown. LH management should compare layouts of Singapore, Emirates, Qatar, Etihad, Korean, Thai, or even the 777's of EVA, ANA, Asiana etc. All are superior. Have not flown LH since my last Business class A380 experience a few years ago. Seats did not lay flat, so you constantly had to push yourself up from the foot rest. Fell victim to advertising that the new seats lay 180 degree flat, but I won't return. LH uses a 2x2x2 layout, rather than a far superior 1x2x1 of other5 Star Airlines. EVA & others offer 1x2x1 on their 777's. Seats on the LH A380 are the most narrow of any A380 I've flown. Tiny foot space. No privacy dividers between seats, unlike most 5 Star airlines, so it is a crowded feeling. Seats are low back, so you can view the TV screens of every other passenger if you are in the rear of business class. Very distracting. Do not understand why LH consistently fails to select high quality seating? Seat controls are on top of the arm rests, so if you lower your seat to sleep, you must crawl ""up out of the hole"" to make adjustments. Who thought this was a good design feature? Inflight personnel offer professional service, but are let-down by poor catering & cleaning. On the IAH/FRA segment I was seated in 2nd row of Business & 3rd row on the FRA/IAH return, yet on both flights there was NO entrée selection when the flight attendant came to take the meal orders. Catering had apparently failed to properly cater the flight in both directions, so there was zero meal selection. You just had to take whatever they had boarded. The printed menu is another joke. There is NO consistency to LH's printed menu, & the food you may receive. On the FRA/IAH segment the menu listed ""traditional Italian ice creams"". What was served was yogurt with granola. Is this another mistake by catering? The cleaning crew in Frankfurt could use updated training. Side business class storage compartments were filled with assorted trash. LH has also totally given up on any pretense of offering a quality amenity bag. Worst of any business class flight I have flown. Also agree with several other reviews that LH should be sued for ""false advertising"" regarding their non-existent business class service on many shorter routes. On many routes their business class is nothing more than the same seating in coach - 3 across with the middle seat being unoccupied. No added leg-room or amenities. The LH Business class lounge at FRA is mediocre at best. For breakfast there were no pastries offered. Just some powdered eggs, selection of cold cuts & cheese, & some cold hard bread. This is LH's top offering to Business class passengers? Wewill stay with Asian & Middle Eastern Airlines for our long haul International travel whenever possible. I will say LH is better than UA, AA & DL, but that is nothing to brag about. At least the flight crew kept the bathroom clean & tidy. Waited 40 minutes for our bags upon IAH arrival.

"""customer service is the worst""",1,S Ganusharan,28th June 2018,"✅ Trip Verified |  Detroit to Chennai via Frankfurt. One of the worst customer service you will experience. Myself and my 15 month old daughter are traveling from Detroit to Chennai via Frankfurt. When we reached the airport, they checked in the bag and when they checked the passport, they found that my wife cannot travel as there is a new rule that if you have a layover in Frankfurt, we need a valid schengen visa or a US stamped visa. We told Lufthansa that you never told us anything while booking the tickets or even when i called them to pay for the seat allotment as Lufthansa charges person for getting the bassinet seat (Most other airlines provide it free if you book the flight with infant). Lufthansa just want to get the money from you and never provide any information. The person at the check in counter said it is in our website and i asked him to show it, he went and wandered for 15 minutes and said he lost the sheet which had that information. I checked their website and nothing says about the rule. They mention that if you have two layover within Europe you need schengen visa, but not for a single layover within Frankfurt. And the person in the counter said, if you have booked the ticket through Lufthansa, the customer service should provide me alternate route. So, i called the customer service as i booked the flight through Lufthansa.com. When i called Lufthansa customer service, they told me that they cannot do anything apart from cancelling (which i dont get any refund) or postpone the flight to some other day so that i can go and get schengen visa. I am speaking to them saying getting schengen visa takes days and my wife and daughter has to travel within couple of days. The customer service person said they cannot do anything. So, i went back to the check in counter and the person over there called the supervisor who made a call to customer service of Lufthansa and explained the situation. Lufthansa finally said they can put us in another flight with a huge layover everywhere and also it cost us $1500 more as it is considered as one way flight and we need to pay from our pocket. I have been going through all this mess in the airport and took almost 4 hours with the 15 month old baby sitting in the airport. I decided not to fly with Lufthansa as they treated really really bad and went to Qatar Airways and flew with them, who provided excellent care for the baby and myself. But Lufthansa didnt stop there, they charged me extra for missing the flight and also charged me more as my return flight is with Lufthansa. So, i ended by paying more than $3500 for the entire flight from Detroit to Chennai and my return flight. The person in the check in counter said, they see same scenario everyday (at least 2 people every day). Lufthansa is  making free money from 2 people at just one airport and i am imagining how much money they make from all the airport around the world. They charge people when they knew that they cannot fly and also charge them more whey they miss the flight due to Lufthansa mistake. While booking the ticket, why cannot Lufthansa mention this. Lufthansa mention that you need to have a valid schengen visa is there is multiple layover within Europe. If you can say that, why cannot Lufthansa say that if you don't have a valid US visa or a Schengen visa you cannot have a layover in Frankfurt.

It would take more than an hour or two to get to the gate! But then I realised from the live departure board that my flight to London has departed. As that was Lufthansa's last flight to London on that day, I had to wait until the next day to fly back. There was a long queue at Lufthansa's service centre as well. They arranged a hotel for me to stay near the airport with taxi vouchers. The airport hotel didn't turn out to be so near the airport and the taxi driver was horrible to me.

A passenger was apparently smoking-where and when it is of course not allowed - but to wake up 400+ passengers with an incomprehensible long and loud rant by the lead FA in the middle of the night was not appreciated or professional. Also bags did not make the flight and although Lufthansa keeps emailing you on every element of the trip (like gate changes), they didn't bother to inform us our bags were never loaded in LAX, why?

First you call 800-645-3880 and prepare for half hour minimum call (once I was cut off after hold). I explained just wanted to move up the Istanbul to Frankfurt segment couple days. Again a long hold the agent says no problem same fare. But I will need to pay $1,500 in taxes.  I ask for explanation and none given. I then for cost to cancel the entire return trip and it is $900. This made no sense so I decided to go to the airport to talk to a human being face to face. Lufthansa has their Istanbul airport office and I get some service counter agent who basically has to call and hold just like I did from hotel. Another 20 minutes to be told to change the Istanbul segment would be $2,400! If I were to purchase a business class ticket today from Istanbul to Frankfurt it is $350? So why $2,400?

"""turned out to be a nightmare""",1,K Malcom,12th June 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | This is my 3rd bad experience with Lufthansa in the last 3 months and I think I need to share it. I was travelling Business Class from Zagreb to Frankfurt and then to London with a layover in FRA of 1hr 45min. Boarding at ZAG was done without priority boarding. When landing at FRA the pilot lost his way around the airport and took about 20 minutes to park at a remote stand. Not only no separate bus was used for C class passengers, but instead all passengers were squeezed like sardines into one single bus. When I reached Terminal A I had to walk for over a mile and take a train to make it to gates B where my flight for LHR was departing from. I have never before had to go through security again during a transfer when travelling within Europe, yet Lufthansa decided to send me through a route that required security screening again. The queue for the security was one of the longest I have ever seen in my life. As a business class passenger and Star Alliance Gold member I attempted to enter the Fast Track. A lady standing at the entrance refused entrance to me saying just ""No"", despite me showing her my C class boarding pass and my gold star alliance card. I asked her three times whether Lufthansa does not allow passengers to use fast track any more and she kept telling me one single word, ""No"". I waited in the normal security queue for 40 minutes and that left me no single minute for lounge access. When I reached the gate, boarding just started and no priority boarding was used again. The Lufthansa agent just opened the gate and said ""please go"" and all passengers just run towards the plane. There are not a lot of benefits for business class European flights. People pay a significant additional amount of money to get a couple of extra benefits which it appears that Lufthansa refuses for no specific reason. What should have been a comfortable layover turned out to be a nightmare for me and a gap of nearly 2hrs between the flights disappeared. I have experienced inconsistent and bad service from Lufthansa both on the ground and in the air in another two occasions recently and this is enough for me to say that I would not recommend this airline to anyone and certainly don't waste your money to pay for business class because it is questionable whether you will receive any of the benefits at all.",CRJ1000 / A320,Business,Business Class,Zagreb to London via Frankfurt,June 2018,3.0,2.0,3.0,,1.0,1,no

The seats were very comfy, WI-FI was fast, food was good, and the staff was very friendly. Boarding started on time and in the correct order. Boarding went very smooth, and as soon as I boarded, I was welcomed to the purser. The food was great and seat very comfortable. I slept great and enjoyed my meals. Lufthansa’s staff is outstanding. A man sitting next to me was very inpatient and kept complain about the fact that the person behind him got his meal first even though he had a higher status. I would have already stopped serving, but the crew kept smiling and putting up with his moaning. My flight was great and I would definitely recommend it. After I landed in Frankfurt, I had a 4 hour layover until my connection to Zurich, but it went great and very smooth. As I was very tired, I headed to the lounge to rest, but after the lounge staff saw I was almost sleeping in my seat, they offered me a bedroom with a shower. The bed was perfect and the room looked like a 4-star hotel. The shower was outstanding and I was impressed with the service. After my rest, I headed to my connecting flight to Zurich. This flight also went very smooth and the food was great. After I landed, I accidentally forgot my iPhone on the plane, but before I had even noticed I left it, the flight attendant came running through the terminal to give it to me, I was amazed.

Unfortunately this aircraft was not prepared for Lufthansa Inflight Entertainment like the most aircrafts of Lufhansa, so it was not possible to use the Lufthansa App that provides several entertainment options. I am really disappointed about the seats. The seat was too thin and too short. All Lufthansa singlle aisle aircrafts have this type of seats. This was not a pleasure as the flight take 2 hours and 30 minutes and I had some pain at the lower back area and thigs. I guess for a shorter flight the seat is ok, but for flight of more than 2 hours it can be very unconfotable to sit on such a seat. The menu/food was ok, the tast more bland than nice. I expect more from a 5 star airline, especaially in business class! There was only one choise of coffee, filter coffee. No further coffees available like espresso or cappuccino other airlines offer in business class and same typ of aircraft, single aisle. And the service has been done with foof and beverages trollies, this is fine but at some shorter flights within Europe Lufthansa has a signature service.

"""Service was prompt and friendly""",8,T Thomas,29th April 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Business class on A321 service from Munich to Madrid. Departure was delayed due to a faulty coffee machine, of all things, but was impressed with the efficient gate change and marginal delay, even after they had to identify an alternative aeroplane. In the end, delayed by about 30 mins. Boarding was free-for-all, given the delay, but still relatively pleasant. Business seating on this flight was exactly the same as economy, except for the fact that the centre seat is left empty with a ""seat-filler"", that allows you to ""share"" the empty seat space with your other seating partner as a table-rest. Legroom also felt pretty much the same as economy. There was no IFE, other than ""pay-for-service"" wifi, if you wished. The differentiation is the food, obviously - as we were served a full breakfast on this 2 hour hop, with the food being even better than the business class breakfast served on the long-haul LH flight.

First impression was that of spaciousness, because of the high ceiling (high mounted luggage compartments). The seats have electronic adjustment of virtually all parameters, including chair softness. AKG noise cancelling headphones, and adjustable IFE screen. Slight criticisms - the pockets for placing items were not very large, for example, difficult to fit in an iPad, and not many clever storage crannies. Service throughout was efficient but lacking the warmth and friendliness of Asian airlines. Food for dinner was served on departure and the menu looked good. Breakfast before arrival was less impressive; but edible nonetheless. Reclining seats were very easy to manage; sleeping horizontal was slightly less comfortable than expected because cushions were a little firm.

The benefits were obvious, especially when travelling with a little, impatient child - you'll learn to love the fast lane, the lounge (even though the one in PMI is quite disappointing, but it is run by the airport itself and used for every airline), and the priority luggage service (which I never noticed on business trips, as I only had carry-on luggage). We loved the quiet atmosphere in the well booked business class compartment - our daughter had two seats on her own to take a nap almost throughout the entire flight.

I asked the staff to confirm this information, but she told me that everything was indicated on the ticket, which was not the case since it did not indicate the local time of arrival to Tokyo, so I had to request the information from another staff. Finally, the flight took off later than the scheduled time expected so I was afraid that I could not connect flights on time.

This is a 2-2-2 configuration and the seats are far too close to each other and lack any real sense of privacy (nor do they have a privacy screen). I do the same sector frequently and this is by far the worst of the major airlines. The cabin looks great but in practical terms (ie the need to sleep), it is very poor.

Security at JFK T1 is always disorganized, with pre check sometimes available and often not. This time, there was  a dedicated lane, I got to pass with shoes on, but, at x ray, the officer suddenly insisted “there is no precheck” and sent my bag to be prodded, examined and swabbed. LH owns a quarter of T1 and so would seem to have a at least a quarter of the responsibility to sort out the chronic security mess. The lounge was overcrowded and under catered, worn and unchanged. Pre flight dining is now a standard expectation for C class transatlantic flights, but here for a 10.30 pm departure, the offer is a bowl of canned vegetables, sadly wilting on a steam table, next to Teriyaki chicken. There are also some chicken wraps, just about edible. The wines are basic. Pre flight at TXL is even worse. Mobile boarding passes must be exchanged for paper at the desk - no obvious reason; the lounge is outside security, shabby, with a flair of filth. At 4pm, when you might want a bite to catch up on a missed lunch, catering consists of pretzel and potato salad. The security line is long and slow, inspection excessively manual. When you are on the plane, things improve. The A330 on the route has an F cabin but operates C class only, so the front is partly given away to preferred passengers and partly sold to less preferred ones for Euro 450 per leg.

About one hour before scheduled flight to LHR we had been informed about flight cancellation. This was just the begin of our horror trip .We spent almost six hours at DUS airport trying to rebook our flight. Customer service desk at the airport was rude and unwilling to help, so we had to rebook our flight to LAX on our own, via the Lufthansa call-centre. Unfortunately the first available flight was on the next day from FRA. Few words to the flight itself. I know flying economy class you can not expect too much. But the seat comfort and entertainment on Lufthansa A380 is in my opinion below average. Seats comparing to other airlines (KLM and Aeromexico) felt very cramped and uncomfortable and touchscreens unresponsive. The only positive aspect of the flight was the flight crew, which was very attentive.

The seats are a significant upgrade over Economy seats. They are slightly wider, have more legroom and more generous recline. Furthermore, each seat has a power socket. The service was basically an economy service with some enhancements (juice as welcome drink, food was served on china plates, but is the same food as in Economy). The flight attendants were professional as usual on Lufthansa, but the service was nothing exceptional.

"""leaves a lot to be desired for""",8,Stefan Oelze,17th February 2018,"✅ Trip Verified |  Whilst I am very proud that Lufthansa has become the first European airline to be awarded 5 Stars and they got it so right with the logo redesign, it is unfortunately also still true that the situation at its main hub, Frankfurt, leaves a lot to be desired for. Traveling every week on the same route (to and from Milan) from Frankfurt, the chances of boarding a departing flight via a finger directly from the terminal are 50/50. Sometimes buses depart from gates in the newly added terminal A part that require a good 10 mins walk to get there. Arriving into Frankfurt almost always means an apron position somewhere on the tarmac and easily a 10 mins bus drive. So, for instance landing on the relatively new runway West, taxiing can take 10 mins to the parking position, sometimes adding waiting time for buses to arrive and 10 mins to get to the terminal? That adds up to almost 50% of the flying time from Milan! Crazy. Frankfurt airport uses retired, cramped buses from local public transport bus companies. Then arriving bus passengers get cattled via a narrow staircase into the terminal, where on some lucky days there are two airport employees with iPads helping with gate information but generally being overwhelmed by the number of passengers asking for information. Sometimes connecting passengers are left to their own devices at this badly signposted airport with only a few areas where screens would provide up-to-date gate information. But the worst part is how Lufthansa and Frankfurt airport are providing for premium travelers (with the exception of HONs and First Class passengers). Long waiting times at security and in the Schengen Area in Terminal A there are a total of 3 lounges that, at peak times, are more than overcrowded. Schengen departures in Terminal B have no lounge access whatsoever. Guests in the three lounges (2 business, one Senator/Star Alliance Gold) can stand for an hour and are being catered for by a disappointing offer of food. All this leaves regular Lufthansa clients guessing why the airline gets it so right with their second hub Munich (2 Business lounges and a total of 4 Senator lounges/areas). In their London, Munich and hopefully soon Malpensa lounge, Lufthansa also provides a much more sophisticated food offer compared to its main hub, Frankfurt. So what is it, that is the cause of this difference? Maybe all Lufthansa management responsible for travel experience should be paired up with a passenger and follow their real travel experience for the duration of their Frankfurt airport stay to help realize, how sub-optimal the whole set-up really is.",,Business,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Milan,February 2018,4.0,5.0,2.0,,2.0,3,yes

"""I will not fly with them again""",2,Brice Dallard,3rd February 2018,"✅ Trip Verified |  Toulouse to Singapore via Frankfurt. The TLS-FRA flight arrived late, leading to miss the connecting flight to SIN and causing me to spend the night in FRA. These things happen, and as a frequent traveler working in the aerospace industry, I'm more understanding than most. However, I was not impressed at all by the way the situation was handled:  no information was given by the crew about the delay of the TLS-FRA leg. We were just stuck in the aircraft, doors closed, and not moving. After asking multiple times, I was told by the FA it was because of fog in FRA. When I proceeded to claim compensation, the airline told me it was because of French Air Traffic Control Strike. Remembering the chaos in FRA airport that evening, I have a hard time believing that. No staff was available to provide assistance once arrived in FRA airport. All customer service desks were closed, even though it was obvious that there was a big mess in FRA. It was impossible to reach the hotline to check for alternative flights. I stayed online for 2 times 45 mns, before giving up. So I organized my own hotel, transportation and meals, and in line with EU regulation 261/2004, I asked the airline to pay for the expense incurred. It has now been 4 months, and I have yet to receive the funds. I received a reply 6 weeks ago telling me the payment has been made, but it never reached my bank account. Now, customer relations department is just playing dead. On the onboard experience itself, I would say that the crew is professional, but rather cold. Food is edible, but I thought below average of other full service airlines. The major issue lies with FRA airport, where connections are very long: I had to walk 35 mns and take a train to reach the other terminal. Security was very long, with only 2 lines open, and rude staff at every checkpoint (passport control, security, boarding gates). Considering the ticket price, I will not fly with them again, mostly because of FRA airport, and the ""ghost"" customer relations department.

"""No welcome drink""",4,M Kronz,2nd February 2018,"✅ Trip Verified |  Munich to Athens. The points I mention don´t mean much, but in combination they make you wonder why you spent more than the price of an economy class ticket. Outbound flight MUC-ATH (Jan.13th, 2018): I noticed that the Business Class security fast lane at MUC airport was not open. The food in the business lounge at MUC is fine but the same. When boarding the aircraft you used to be addressed by name, not for me. The A321 business cabins have a fixed tray table across the middle seat which is very awkward for sitting down and getting up when you have a window seat. An economy class passenger stowed his hand luggage in the business class overhead compartment. No welcome drink, and announcements in German and English, no Greek.  The onboard choice of meals consisted of two main courses, the one I chose I found inedible. LH always serves freshly baked bread which is nice but for some reason they forgot me so I had to ask for it. After meal, economy class passengers queued to use the business class toilet. Return flight ATH-MUC the lounge at ATH airport nice with  better food than MUC but no toilets. Staff took the trouble to annouce LH departures personally which was a nice touch. At gate, priority boarding was announced but not enforced. This is one of the most annoying problems with LH business class travel and it happens all the time. On the flight, again no announcements in Greek, food markedly better, but disorganised service.

There were 4 options for the main course; duck (which I’m not fond of), a beef stew (also not my favourite), a vegetarian option (pappardelle) or fish. Since fish was the only option I was attracted to I took it. The fish was ‘loup de mer’, presentation was rather uninspired and the taste was extremely salt. Luckily the cheese and dessert trolley had some very good options and all was served very professionally by the crew which was one of the best and most dedicated I ever had. Champagnes and wines were not the most well renowned names as with some other airlines but the quality was extremely good and typical for the regions/varieties. Just before landing the crew came to say us goodbye personally. We landed on time in MEX and were welcomed by a Lufthansa representative holding a board with our names. The representative took us directly to the diplomatic passport immigration desks. Next we went to the luggage belt where our HON labelled luggage was already standing in front of the belt. This was really amazing; from getting out of the aeroplane to getting out of the airport with our luggage took us only a couple of minutes. This was the fastest I ever went through immigration.

The transfer at Frankfurt was terrible, having to change terminals, use a train and go through security again so contacted the customer service and asked for my return flight if I could have an earlier flight from Manchester to Frankfurt. This would involve a 3am start and I would have to pay for a hotel. Was told that this couldn't be done but if I turned up for the flight and checked in the change could be made at check-in. Turned up at 04:00 to be told this isn't possible and I have to phone Lufthansa. Made the call and after an hour and 300 EUR I had the earlier flight. Arrived at Frankfurt and began the delays, 2 hours at the gate, then 4 hours sat on the plane as the de-icer was needed, then it was needed again. So arrived after a 23 hour day still to ensure a 4 hour drive home. So, sent an e-mail and letter to Lufthansa giving them my feedback from my first trip with them, the bad customer service and the great cabin crew. Received a call from the customer service team (located in Manila) with an apology and an offer of 600 EUR compensation. Agreed this and felt that Lufthansa had actually listened to me. 2 hours later receive a call to tell me a mistake has been made and the compensation is only 300 EUR - sorry I say, you made an offer which was accepted and I'm not accepting you changing your mind. They told me they would speak to a manager and call me back. Received an e-mail 20 minutes later to tell me my 'request' for compensation had been rejected and a cheque had been issued for the lower amount.

"""will avoid Lufthansa connections""",2,K Stone,2nd December 2017,"✅ Trip Verified | Budapest to Venice via Munich. The first flight from Budapest departed with 20-30 mins of delay. This is ok as delays can occur and the duration was rather short. However, arrival in Munich was also delayed in turn by 20-30 mins. The connection in Munich was known in advance to be short, for which reason it is expected that the airline has foreseen how to manage this flight combination. Instead this connection was managed very poorly. Arrival in Munich airport took place at the gate area K, while the connecting flight (to Venice) was at gate area G. This, according to the screen indication itself, requires 17 mins of transfer time. Upon arrival, I noticed on the screen that the connecting flight was already boarding. After taking the shuttle train (needed for this transfer) and running the rest of the way, I arrived at the gate only to discover that the flight was gone. It seems nobody bothered to advise that there was somebody on the way, and hopefully the plane could wait for a mere 10 mins. Offering a connection implies that it is reasonably managed. In spite of the short connection in this case, it seems the airline makes it even worse by setting flights at different areas and not advising of people in transfer. I would never ask a plane with all passengers to wait for a long time, but I do not believe 10 mins would be an issue for anyone. After the above experience, I went to the service desk for help, where I was told that there is ""fortunately another flight tonight"". That meant at 22:00 vs. the original 15:30 that I missed. To illustrate the staff's further lack of customer service, I was told I am eligible for a voucher since I will spend a long time at the airport. I was given a voucher for 10 euros. After indicating that a 10-euro voucher does not seem exactly a correct response from the airline for the trouble caused, I was told that maybe it was a system error, and after a second check, the staff confirmed that in fact I am eligible for 17 euro. I did not continue the discussion as it would have been a waste of time. The above service gives me an impression that the airline simply does not care. In fact it feels like a joke. In any case, I would have expected a much different treatment for a company with a German origin and reputation.

"""We are done with Lufthansa""",1,K Pearce,24th October 2017,"✅ Verified Review |  We flew on Air Dolomiti which I understand partners with Lufthansa on October 20, 2017. Our flight LH 2301 was scheduled to leave Amsterdam at 8.55 am but did not leave the airfield until 9.43 am. While we were waiting in the airport there was never an announcement as to why it was late. We had an international connecting flight to Los Angeles leaving at 11.20 am. We barely made it there and I was having a meltdown. As anyone who has ever been in Munich airport will agree, it is not the easiest to navigate though. The only time Air Dolomiti said anything was before they landed apologizing for the ""delay"". Once again, no explanation.

"""a 4 hour wait at the airport""",1,Martin Grove,23rd October 2017,"✅ Verified Review |  London to Dresden via Frankfurt. First time with Lufthansa, short queue checking in at Heathrow so good start, but soon after entering the airport flight information was showing a 25 minute delay. Eventually boarded plane and flight took off around 1 hour late, problems with crew apparently. During the flight we were  told that they had no information about connecting flights and should check the flight boards in the airport. But as soon as we landed and I switched on my phone I had an email stating that I was booked on the later 22:05 flight to Dresden. Facing a 4 hour wait at the airport I went to the very busy Lufthansa service desk where I asked if I could use their airport lounge. As I was only an economy customer and not a Lufthansa member the answer was no. I was given a 10 euro voucher and a copy of my rights as a passenger.",,Business,Economy Class,London to Dresden via Frankfurt,October 2017,2.0,2.0,1.0,,1.0,1,no
"""their service was appalling""",1,D Kemp,18th October 2017,"✅ Verified Review |  Newark-Liberty Intl to Munich, LH0413, 18 Sept 2017. I did not expect something elegant or sophisticated from Lufthansa, but their service was appalling. The flight was delayed due to ""late arrival of the plane"". Quite worn out plane, not much of a welcome on board, dim light in the cabin did not make me feel bad in the beginning but definitely was not comforting. I do not mind not smiling FA's if the level of service is high. On this flight, I learned for the first time what means lousy service in business class, definitely not expected from 4-star airline. Frugal menu had one appetizer (salad) with no other choices. I chose fish for the main course which was greasy, overly salty and poorly presented. Everything came on the same tray. During the meal, no drink refills were offered (I had regular coke), so I had to ask for a favor. After I asked for the tray to be taken away, FA took it and asked me to throw the tablecloth and serviette on top of the tray. I expected a dessert would have been offered but was wrong. So again I had to ask for one. Not happy with my request, FA asked what I wanted and finally brought a portion of fruits which was placed on the table without any preparation. After such ""feast"" I tried to sleep but the seat was (though full flat) bumpy and extremely narrow even for me (I am a slim person). So the only comfortable position was lying on my side. Finally, I was able to fall asleep but was awaken soon by the noise from the galley where FAs were loudly talking without lowering their voices. About 1 hour before landing I asked for breakfast. It was not served right away, so the seatbelt sign came on. FA told me that now the breakfast could not be served. No single positive emotion during the whole flight. Extremely lousy service is only memorable thing about Lufthansa. My flight back with United (Polaris business class) was a pleasant surprise – frankly, I expected the opposite for these two carriers. Lesson learned: Lufthansa’s business is an awkward decoration of a comfort+ class with a flatbed (though very uncomfortable). Given the price for the ticket (almost 9 thousand US $), I will choose Lufthansa only if there is absolutely no alternative.",,Business,Business Class,Newark to Munich,September 2017,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1,no
"""onboard service is above""",4,P Goener,18th October 2017,"✅ Verified Review |  Amsterdam to Addis Ababa via Frankfurt. The onboard service is above average and the legroom is good. However, I had booked to leave on August 25th. On arrival at Schiphol the flight was canceled. Overbooking on another flight was not possible, everything was full. Other flights to Frankfurt departed that evening. Also on Saturdays there was only place on flights with at least three stops and a journey time which was twice as long as planned. Then only one flight took 2 days (!) Later, which cost me 2 days. Cancellation can happen and the fact that there were no good alternatives was not to blame Lufthansa. Where I can admit that Lufthansa does not wish to pay my claim. They indicate that the flight was canceled by the weather conditions. That's strange if you take into account that this was the only flight that was canceled that night, KLM just left Frankfurt. One could easily leave with a delay of an hour or so. Now, in addition to the lack of working hours, I have to make expenses to get what I am entitled to. So service on board 8.5, handling complaints a 2 - the staff is friendly, average 4.2 so. DUTCH: De service aan boord is bovengemiddeld en de beenruimte is goed. Echter ik had geboekt om op 25 augustus te vertrekken. Bij aankomst op schiphol was de vlucht geannuleerd. Overboeken op een andere vlucht was niet mogelijk, alles zat vol. Andere vluchten naar Frankfurt vertrokken wel die avond. Ook op zaterdag was er enkel plaats op vluchten met minimaal drie stops en een reisduur welke twee keer zo lang was als gepland. Toen maar een vlucht 2 dagen(!) later genomen wat mij 2 dagen werktijd kostte ter plekke. Annuleren kan gebeuren en ook het feit dat men geen goede alternatieven had is Lufthansa niet te verwijten. Waar ik mij wel aan kan ergeren dat Lufthansa niet mijn claim wenst te betalen. Zij geven aan dat de vlucht geannuleerd was door de weercondities. Dat is vreemd als je in ogenschouw neemt dat dit de enigste vlucht was die geannuleerd werd die avond,KLM vertrok gewoon wel naar Frankfurt. Men had dus makkelijk met een vertraging van een uur of zo kunnen vertrekken. Nu moet ik dus naast het gemis van werkuren onkosten maken om te krijgen waar ik recht op heb. Dus service aan boord 8.5 afhandeling klachten een 2 ( de medewerksters is wel vriendelijk), gemiddeld 4.2 dus.",,Business,Economy Class,Amsterdam to Addis Ababa via Frankfurt,August 2017,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,3,no
"""experience was frustrating""",2,G Wang,17th October 2017,"✅ Verified Review |  Athens to Vancouver via Munich. Despite the comfortable seat and good inflight entertainment in premium economy from Munich to Vancouver, our experience was frustrating, flat out disappointing. We could not check in one of 4 travelers online under one booking. Error messages such as unfortunately you are unable to check in online, your name, ticket number etc may be incorrect, and your routing does not match your ticket. Error messages were different every time we tried so you didn’t know what exactly was the reason. We were questioning whether he even had a ticket. Called customer service multiple times only for them to tell us to call tech support which was not open 24/7. We had to wait. Tech support advised that passenger was selected randomly to manually check in at the airport. Had that message shown at online check in, it would have avoided some undue stress and costly int’l roaming charges for calls. Original gate from ATH-MUN was rather close to our MUN-YVR, however we needed all the time we could get to go through exit customs since my mother in law is unable to run. On arrival, the gate of the current flight had changed, and it could not have been father away from our connecting fight. Boarding an A330 MUN-YVR was a disaster. Other than frequent flyers/business class boarding first, it was general boarding for everyone all at once and this included wheelchair passengers. If you’re a seasoned traveler, you know boarding in an orderly fashion from the back of the aircraft to the front helps prevent backlogs. Passengers were backlogged on the jet bridge so that it piled up back to a short escalator that was available to passengers and their carry ons which most, if not all, used it. Safety issue here is that it bunched up people all the way to the bottom of the escalator where those getting off had no place to go. Upon arrival into YVR, we were advised our checked baggage did not make the connection in MUN and advised they will deliver our bags the following evening. They were not delivered as promised the following evening and delivered another 12 hours later the following morning. Total 40hrs. We wrote an email to customer relations right after the online check in fiasco and the email did warrant a response from Lufthansa. It has been 7 days and still no response. ",A330 / A320,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Athens to Vancouver via Munich,October 2017,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1,no

Transfer in Frankfurt was easier than expected and had a 2 hour break in the lounge - which again is big step up from before with nice food on offer. The A380 trip to Beijing was very pleasant. I'm not a fan of the seats arranged in pairs and your feet end very close to your neighbour and seat lacks privacy.

The weak point is that I often experience changes in the flight times (I fly this route several times a year, and about 4 round trips a year on Lufthansa). The airline expects you to be understanding and accommodating, and doesn't give compensation when it causes its passengers inconveniences (like changing the departure time of its flights, or changing the aircraft type at the last hour and your booked and paid premium seat is no longer available). When you ask to be accommodated on another flight (like a later flight after a schedule change), Lufthansa provides a bunch of excuses. Their customer service call centres are a waste of time.

As I arrived early at the airport Lufthansa moved me to an earlier flight to Frankfurt, and forced me to sit in a middle seat. Crowded and old A320, with soon-disintegrating seats. Service was good, with delicious sandwich and German beer served in glass bottles. Extremely long transit walk at Frankfurt, nearly one hour gate-to-gate, with extremely rude security staff. Chaotic boarding at Frankfurt. One unacceptable thing onboard Lufthansa flights to Hong Kong is that all announcements are made in Mandarin (language in China) instead of Cantonese (main language in Hong Kong), except the safety video which makes the service inconsistent. Mediocre meal but served with wide range of beverages, including post-dinner drinks.

"""It was impossible to sleep""",1,T Girling,14th September 2017,"✅ Verified Review |  I booked Lufthansa Business Class because I needed to sleep en-route in a quiet environment.  I paid 67,000 Miles & More points for this supposedly restful, relaxing flight and I selected seat 1A on the lower deck of the 747-400 because it is supposedly a secluded area of the cabin. I discovered that two noisy young children were seated together in seats 1H and 1K, with their parents seated behind in 2H and 2K. The parents ignored them and left them to make as much noise as they wanted on the 11½ hour flight. They were loud and uncontrolled, and their laughing and shrieking lasted the entire journey, as did their playing with their overhead and angle-poise seat lights in the darkened cabin. It was impossible to sleep with this behaviour going on. Why does Lufthansa allow young children in long-haul Business Class? Why couldn’t the children have been seated one per row by the window with a parent to control them? Lufthansa is responsible for whom they allow into their aircraft cabins and for making informed decisions as to whether their behaviour would upset or disturb other premium passengers. On arrival at the Lufthansa lounge at Frankfurt  I was told that my flight LH936 to LCY had been cancelled.

"""beverages were rarely offered""",7,L Kline,12th September 2017,"✅ Verified Review | Flight from Seattle to Frankfurt, start afternoon in SEA, arrival early morning in FRA, so it was a night flight. Unfortunately, aircraft was a Boeing, thus seats much narrower than in an Airbus. Flight on time and very calm - usual, very good Lufthansa standard. However, cabin staff was not very attentive and sometimes even rude. Beverages were only rarely offered, collection of garbage even more rare. During the night, cabin staff went through the cabin with beverage trays, but did not look carefully if some passengers might be awake and wishing something to drink. About 2 hours before landing, I asked a cabin attendant who passed by with a beverage tray whether she could pick off my garbage, i.e. three empty cups. She said that she is not allowed to put garbage on a tray with food products (which I know) and she had other guests to care for. She would be back later. I asked when as I was aware that they would soon have to start serving breakfast before landing, and she said ""soon"". I did not want to talk too much or too loudly as most other passengers slept, just wanted to know whether the next collection of garbage would happen after the breakfast, whether it would make sense to go to the washroom before without disturbing the distribution of breakfast etc. Had a flight with Air Canada from Frankfurt to Calgary three weeks earlier, and they offered beverages much more often, and they also collected garbage. It was my first time that I experienced rude Lufthansa cabin staff, but other airlines do offer beverages much more frequently during long-distance flights, and they also collect garbage more frequently. Breakfast: only savoury, omelette with roasted bacon and onions. I prefer a sweet breakfast and hoped to get some sort of German breakfast on a flight to Germany with a German airline: some bread, butter, jam, maybe cheese and sausage or even some yoghurt. I am aware that an airline cannot fully respond to all customers' wishes, but a choice between a Northern American breakfast and a continental (German) breakfast would have been highly appreciated. Why not offering two choices as they do with the warm dinner (pasta or chicken)? I still recommend and choose LH for short-distance flights within Europe.

"""FAs were very good""",9,D Collard,16th July 2017,"✅ Verified Review |  Vancouver to Geneva return via Munich. Premium Economy class booked through Lufthansa website, with advance seat selection. Victoria to Vancouver  20-minute connecting flights by Air Canada Jazz used Dash 8-Q400 turboprops; and Munich to Geneva by Air Dolomiti on Embraer E195. Vancouver to Munich on A330-300 aircraft. Air Dolomiti flights had comfortable seating, and featured a couple of different regional Italian wines on each flight. LH Premium Economy seating was 2-3-2 across (instead of 2-4-2 in economy), with an extra four inches of legroom (35-inch pitch). Extra legroom and footrest were welcome but seats were narrower than they ought to have been. Between the window-seat armrests and the fuselage was a 5-cm gap on each side of the plane, and all seats had tray tables in the armrests. The front row of Premium Economy also had IFE screens in the armrests – small screens half the size of those in the other rows. FAs were very good. Two meals were served, the main one after take-off, the second 1½ hours before landing. The meals seemed to be  regular economy meals – chicken or pasta options for the main meal – except that in Premium Economy they were served on porcelain and serving size may have been slightly larger. IFE was good, although films and TV shows were classified in unexpected categories. Outbound connection from YYJ through YVR is always easy because domestic passengers can remain on the secure airside to international flights without a further security screening at YVR. Connection through MUC was better than a year ago because, although you have to go through passport control entering the Schengen area, no extra security screening was required there either. Likewise on the return trip, no further security screening was required through MUC leaving the Schengen area. When entering Canada at YVR you have to go through Canadian Border Services inspection and collect your baggage but even at that point, for passengers connecting to domestic flights, they provide a dedicated area for onward baggage transfer and a dedicated security checkpoint. Despite connection times of only 1 hour to 1½ hours at YVR and MUC, both my bags arrived with me at the destination. The only hitch was that LH and AC use different booking codes. After booking my trip on the LH website I had to telephone AC to ask for the AC booking code, which I needed in order to do the initial check-in at YYJ.",A330,Business,Premium Economy,Vancouver to Geneva via Munich,June 2017,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,5,yes

The service was horrible. Currently we are waiting to depart and there is neither personnel nor plane at our gate when we are meant to fly out in 15 minutes with no update on how late the flight is.  The options for in flight entertainment were largely disappointing, even for bilingual passengers. The flight 2 weeks ago from HKG-FRA was 30 minutes late causing us to rush to make our flight from FRA-TXL (Berlin). The onboard and ground staff were unhelpful in trying to fast track us through to our next flight. I have never flown on a long haul flight without the rest of my party.

"""required a visa to transit""",1,B Malmen,27th June 2017,"✅ Verified Review |  I was due to fly from Marrakech to Istanbul today on Lufthansa and when I arrived at the check-in desk at Marrkech Airport they refused to allow me to check in, claiming that I required a visa to transit Frankfurt, despite the fact that Germany allows Transit Without Visa for Moroccan citizens and I had already transited Frankfurt on the same ticket with no problems when flying from Istanbul to Casablanca on Lufthansa just three weeks before. I phoned Lufthansa reservations and they told me that I was right and that I absolutely did not require a visa for a 1 hour transit and I should try to check in online instead, which I did sucessfully. However, the Swissport staff at the airport still refused to give me a boarding pass and allow me to board the flight. They claimed to have phoned German immigration in Algeria but refused to give the name of the person they had spoken to. Their refusal to check me in led me to miss my flight. They refused to provide anything in writing despite me asking several times. I wasted an enormous amount of time and money getting to Marrakech airport, paying for a hotel there, car rental and reserving accomodation in Istanbul. Lufthansa took my money and then refused to allow me to travel. It appears that buying a Lufthansa ticket is like a lottery ticket - maybe you will get to fly somewhere but maybe you will just be told ""no"" and then the ticket that you paid lots of money for becomes worthless.

"""see passengers as real people""",9,Immanuel Lanzaderas,26th May 2017,"✅ Verified Review |  Budapest to Montreal via Munich. I was going to upgrade to Premium Economy, but reviews said it was pretty much the same seat and food as regular economy; so, I didn't. Online check-in was easy using the booking code, but there was no option to upgrade. To find that out, I had to go to a service counter in Munich. Flight out of Budapest was late, but staff were apologetic about it. Boarding process in Munich was a bit chaotic, since they did not inform passengers about the pre-boarding document check (which seems redundant, since they are not Customs, and we all already went through customs). Staff on the flight were friendly and attentive. They re-arranged seats for a couple with an infant, so that they could use the bassinet in the first row. The woman who gave up her seat got a voucher to use for duty free. These are really nice touches that show they see their passengers as real people with real needs. Alcohol selection was excellent: sparkling wine, wines, beers, liquors, and cognac for after the meal. The meal was fine. I liked the chicken, and the real cutlery. The entertainment system is worth choosing Lufthansa over other airlines that are offering less for within $200 of the the price. There were hundreds of movies to choose from - from many different cultures. The system was really responsive and quick. The screeN is at least 25% bigger than the ones on Air Canada, and it adjusts to more angles. USB plugs were easily accessible, right beside the screen.

"""great crews, great service""",8,Ben Lolley,23rd May 2017,"✅ Verified Review |  Washington to Birmingham via Frankfurt. This was my first experience with Lufthansa, products I experienced were Economy on the A319-100 and Premium Economy on A340-300. I opted to fly with LH as they offered both the best price for the overall trip and the most favourable times to work with my journey plans. I had initially planned to fly Economy for the entirety of the journey; however, the additional cost for a premium economy seat was so minor that it made sense to elect for the premium option. I made the booking using the LH website initially, which was fine, but then opted to manage my booking using the mobile app. The app I found to be very cumbersome and slow. It took some navigating to make simple amendments like seat choices or adding API/visa data.  I didn't have hold baggage for this journey so my exposure to ground staff was minimal. The first leg of my journey commenced at BHX. The check in process proceeded without issue; however there was a slight delay with boarding, and we departed 30 minutes late. This made me nervous given that I was meeting a connecting flight, however the cabin crew were friendly, informed us of progress and connection plans at all times. I was seated in 10A, and exit row seat with ample leg room. We were offered a basic snack (marble cake) and a juice/coffee. Service was expedient and pleasant; which is how I would describe all of the flight. After landing at FRA I proceeded to my next flight. Unlike many airlines there aren't many ground perks for flying PE with LH. no lounge access, no priority boarding. The enhanced comfort offered on board however is more than worth the cost. The PE seats on the A340 were akin to retro business class seats. Wide, with built in IFE and tray table, with a foot stand (I was in 10A again). I had an end of aisle seat which meant I was not reclined in to. The catering option offered with PE is the same as economy, served on China and with metal cutlery and a glass. It doesn't sound much but it in fact makes the experience considerably more pleasant. We were allowed use of the business class lavatories which was nice given the economy toilets were a good 15 rows back. The cabin crew overall were friendly and helpful. They seemed cheerful and willing to do as much as they could to enhance your experience. For the flight back I elected to pay to use the IAD Lufthansa BC Lounge. It cost a mere $35 and was worth every penny... however, it lacked some of the comfort and grandure usually associated with lounges. As an economy passenger I wasn't particularly fussed but If I was a BC passenger paying a flexi fare (i.e. a lot of money) I'd have found the lounge to be understaffed, A little untidy, and lacking in food options. The return legs were almost identical to the outbound; same aircraft, same seats, same comfort, friendly crew. The food on this occasion was served in tins, but this can be overlooked. Again the crew offered use of the business class lavatories which I appreciated. Overall my first experiences with Lufthansa were good.

"""very nice travel experience""",9,C Andrews,16th May 2017,"✅ Verified Review | Lufthansa has once again lived up to my expectations of a good airline. I had to make a last minute flight Philadelphia to Berlin via Frankfurt and found not only an excellent price but a very nice travel experience.

Next problem is at boarding which is total mayhem with economy class trying to board at once resulting in delays and a scramble for overhead locker space.

We did indeed miss the DUB flight but we were put up in an airport hotel overnight in FRA with dinner & breakfast provided. Impressively, we informed of this and the new flight arrangements a number of hours before landing into FRA. The next morning we were flown to Oslo and then onto Dublin with SAS (Star Alliance) as all FRA-DUB flights were fully booked for Easter weekend.

"""they refuse to give me the £80 back""",3,H Richards,15th April 2017,"✅ Verified Review |  I recently flew from Manchester to Atlanta via Frankfurt and back with Lufthansa. I was travelling as part of a group and so decided to book a seat to be close to friends. I was surprised that on a flight that cost nearly £1000, I would have to pay to choose my seat but I decided it would be worth paying £20 each way per person for myself and a companion to ensure that we sat together (£80 in total). The first issue I had was that the seats we were given on the flight from Frankfurt to Atlanta and the return leg were not the ones I had booked. We ended up on the very rear row of seats but we were at least sat together. On both flights (10 hours) we were served vegetarian food because apparently Lufthansa only offer chicken to those toward the front of those the plane. To make matters worse, I was later offered a hot dog for lunch, because they had run out of pizza. The hot dog was still completely frozen. I didn't make a fuss, I thought that I would get a refund for the seats and that would be the end of it. The flight itself was comfortable and smooth so I wasn't too unhappy until I spoke with Lufthansa customer services. They told me that the seat booking fee is non refundable and that booking a seat only entitles you to that ""type of seat"" and does not mean you will be sat in the seat that you chose when you made the reservation. So ultimately I have paid for a seat that I didn't get, I had the same type of seat as everyone in economy and yet they refuse to give me the £80 back.

"""defeats the premium feeling""",9,B Stauffer,9th April 2017,"✅ Verified Review |  Flew Geneva to Johannesburg via Frankfurt. The Premium Economy on Lufthansa's B747-800 is strangely squeezed between a mini Economy cabin in the front and the main Economy cabin in the back. There are no separating walls or curtains, which kinds of defeats the ""premium"" feeling (therefore, the 2 dedicated toilets are used by everybody). The seating configuration is 2-4-2 (vs Economy 3-4-3). The seats are wide and recline well, but the foot rest is not well thought out for people over 180cm. The food is basically the same as economy, with an extra dish and served on real china and glasses (but Lufthansa's food offering is good in all classes anyway). Would I book it? Only if the price difference is minimal at booking. Best is to book the cheapest economy and ask for a 299 euro upgrade at checkin or gate in Frankfurt (which is a really good deal on very long flights).

Also with their movement we got our knees whacked. What really gets me is that we paid for what comfort Economy Class offers but this was Sub-Economy standard: we would have had more room to move in an animal crate in the hold. Trying to read or use a laptop was so awkward that we had to give up. The laptop could not be opened more than 45 degrees. We hit some turbulence along the way and were told to buckle up. After a long period of no turbulence my wife had to go to the toilet, as soon as she got into the aisle she was told in a very commanding voice to sit down.

"""no surprises with Lufthansa""",7,W Watson,16th February 2017,"✅ Verified Review | I took Lufthansa flight LH457 from Los Angeles to Frankfurt as the first leg of a trip to Warsaw. For this flight, Lufthansa uses the standard A380. I sat in seat 11D (middle row) in the upper deck. The first thing you feel in boarding this aircraft is that Lufthansa is efficient, courteous and professional. The cabin is clean if not a bit bland, but overall has a comfortable feel to it. The configuration is a 2-2-2, so the middle row is the best bet, as each seat is an aisle. The seats are comfortable and are lay-flat. My only issue is that the controls for the seat are touch and therefore, if you are resting your arm on the armrest, you seat tends to ""readjust"" itself if you brush against the controls. In the lay flat position, the seats are typical of most airlines as they are not exceedly wide, like Singapore Airlines, and narrow for the footwell. One issue is that your feet land on a ledge on the bulkhead which has only a small divider between your feet and your neighbors. Often during the flight, I was awoken as my seatmate changed position and her feet brushed mine. A minor inconvenience, but for some may be too creepy. The service on the flight was very good, if not at the personal level of some of the Asian competitors. The food was decent, but not exceptional and misses the touches of other airlines like ANA, Singapore or even Austrian. The in-flight entertainment is very good. The TV screens are large, clear and easy to see both in the dark and with the cabin lights on. The screen is operated by touch or a remote. You have a massive amount of choices and they seem to have many of the latest movies. Overall, the flight does what it is advertised to do. It gets you there safely, comfortably and in timely manner.

This flight was LH1348 between Frankfurt and Warsaw and although it is a relatively short flight, it is always connected with a long-haul to Frankfurt, so after 10 hours of flight-time, being crammed into coach seats is never welcome. If you have not flown Inter-Europe flights, most airlines do not have a separate business class configuration. They use coach seats and then do not book the middle seat. The service is upgraded in these seats, but you are basically being wedged into coach seats at a business class price.

If they can combine this with proper snack service, it would be great as not all passengers are into drinking alcohol. A warm bread roll would be a good option.

This was most unusual considering at check in they would have had to match my colleagues boarding pass to the name on his passport. Consequently my colleague had to return to the service desk to sort out the mix-up. Boarding was smooth and o board the aircraft appeared well kept. Following take off we were offered drinks and then lunch. I was seated in the second row of a very lightly loaded business class. When I told the FA what I wanted for lunch she apologetically said that they had run out of that choice. The meal I settled for was well presented but lacked taste. The dessert was dry and inedible. Wine selection was okay but I would have liked more choice. The seat was reasonably comfortable and allowed me to have two hours of decent sleep. IFE was mediocre with a sparse selection of new releases. The FA serving my side of the aircraft was friendly and courteous. Flight left slightly late but arrived on schedule.

Apart from some minor ""beauty defects"", none of which turned out to be Lufthansa ´s fault, the flight was uneventful and quite pleasant. We spent some time at the ""Sala Pau Casalls"" business lounge which is a total let-down (see my separate review). Boarding was unpleasant because the announcements were totally incomprehensible and the Airport Operator AENA seems to be finnicky about hand baggage sizes. They refused to let me take my trolley bag onboard because, despite the fact that it has the required dimensions, it expands when it is fully packed. They didn´t mind about that at MUC but they do at BCN. My bag was checked in and arrived on the same flight as myself in MUC, so no major disaster, but you have to be aware of the situation. The business class experience on this flight was pretty much the same as on the inbound MUC-BCN flight - friendly and attentive staff, good food and drinks, good legroom etc, but our A321 was older than the A320 on the inbound flight and had a sort of fixed tray table spanning the free middle seat which is unnecessary and uncomfortable.

"""staff very friendly and attentive""",7,M Kronz,24th January 2017,"✅ Verified Review |  We flew Lufthansa Business Class from Munich to Barcelona on January 8, 2017. Our flight was supposed to leave from Munich's new Terminal 2 satellite building so we arrived early to spend some time at the Star Alliance Schengen Business Lounge which turned out to be a nice experience (see my separate review). Munich right now is going through a phase of Siberian winter so we were prepared for delays, and the boarding time got rescheduled from 12:30 to 13:25 because ""your flight crew didn´t make it to the airport on time"". Funny, because everybody else did despite the snow. During that time the departure gate was changed four times and we ended up having to go back to landside Terminal 2 via the underground people mover to our final departure gate which was totally overcrowded. Boarding started ten minutes past scheduled time which is not a drama but a bit of information would have been nice, but wasn´t forthcoming. Boarding was swift but we then got bussed around the entire airport to a remote stand off Terminal 1 which LH doesn´t even use. Our A320 with sharklets looked brand-new but had apparently been standing around all night in the open and was covered in snow, so after being seated by our very friendly cabin crew the captain came on the interphone to tell us that ""winter has hit us full-blast"" (no explanation or apology for turning up late to work), and that it would take a few minutes to remove snow from the engine inlets and perform the de-icing. In fact we didn´t take off before 16:00, with no further information forthcoming from the flight crew. Obviously, delays are to be expected in the wintertime, but the lack of information is annoying. The flight itself was enjoyable and uneventful, and we landed in Barcelona around 17:30 with apologies for the delay from the flight crew. The Lufthansa cash upgrade from economy to business on European flights is worth the money in my opinion even if LH European business class is technically speaking a premium economy product. But the legroom is pretty good, the seats are quite comfortable and the free middle seat plus foldable armrest improve seating quality no end. The staff are very friendly and attentive, the food is surprisingly good and the hot bread rolls are a nice touch, china and metal cutlery are appreciated and they offer as many hot and cold drink services as you like, and the look of the cabin was new, neat and clean.

When I finally asked they were less than welcoming with the vaguest of answers about us making our connecting flight. Luckily we made the flight with minutes to spare. We asked for a snack before our inflight meal but nothing was available. Again staff were not helpful and kept offering us drink which was of no us to use and meant we had gone 8 hours with nothing but a sandwich on the last flight.

"""the crew had arrived late""",2,P Petrov,10th January 2017,"✅ Verified Review |  Munich to Sofia. The Lufthansa return flight ruined an otherwise perfect holiday. Flights were late on both legs of the journey. On the outgoing flight the explanation given was that the crew had arrived late the previous night and had to use up their 12 hour day rest, so the next day flight was delayed. Our return flight was cancelled 40 minutes before scheduled takeoff. Of course no explanations given, but considering that most other flights were departing on schedule it must not have been the weather. We were quickly rebooked to another flight 4 hours later. 30 min before takeoff that flight was delayed by 1.40 hours, so by the time we boarded we had almost 6 hours of delay. The flight did not depart at the newly announced time either, since doors closed more than 40 minutes later and by the time we were airborne it was another hour late. The flight itself was ok and apparently we made up for some of the delay. Little did we know that after landing we would have another hour of delay, this time waiting for our luggage. The crew's bags were delivered earlier but the passengers had to wait until 1.20 am to get their bags, with noone from Lufthansa or the ground handling operator to explain what was going on. So instead of getting home at 6 something p.m. the previous day we got home at almost 2 am on a Monday - not ideal if you have to go to work at 8.00 am (wish I had the ability to delay my start of work for the 12 hours rest, like the Lufthansa crew).",,Couple Leisure,Business Class,MUC to SOF,January 2017,3.0,5.0,3.0,,1.0,1,no

I have been a fan of Lufthansa for many years but this flight rocked my confidence in them. Following a smooth check-in we proceeded to the lounge which was sweltering hot and had a very poor selection of food and no cold drinks. The departure was delayed due to late arrival of inbound aircraft and further delayed due to late boarding. However, there was no explanation for the reasons of delay or an apology from the cockpit. Onboard, the aircraft looked well kept. It was the European business class configuration with the middle seat of economy style seating left vacant. The FA's were friendly and efficient which was the only redeeming feature of this journey. The food was below acceptable for Business Class and a huge letdown for LH. As expected we were late arriving in Munich and it took over 1 hour from the time we reached our gate for the bags to be delivered.

"""extremely miserable experience""",1,Z Navrenko,7th January 2017,"✅ Verified Review |  Chicago to Moscow via Frankfurt. Extremely miserable experience from business class travel.  Our flight from Chicago was delayed due to some technical problem with the aircraft. Ok, I get it, troubles happen. We had to wait 2 extra hours in a rather miserable United lounge in Chicago. On the aircraft in 2 toilets out of 3 in business, the toilet seat was not holding itself while opened - meaning you have to hold it. When the aircraft was landing some of the next flights were announced to be rebooked, but neither my flight, nor my husband was. Even though there were some flights departing after our flights, we were not announced to be rebooked. When we came out of the plane, there was a service person from Lufthansa answering questions. My husband was guided to the service desk and to me the men standing there said: ""if you run you can catch your flight"". It was 9:30 am and my initial flight LH1444 was boarding at 9:15 in a different zone (we landed to Z zone in FRA airport and my boarding was at B gate). Knowing that FRA is one of the biggest airports in the world I though it may be reasonable to go to the service desk with my husband and ask for a change of the ticket as ""running"" through the airport was not an exactly appealing option for a person with a knee injury. However, when we came to the service desk, there was a man guiding the queue to service desk windows and he also told me that I should run to catch my flight. It was 9:35 AM (as mentioned before, my boarding started at 9:15 AM). So if two people told me I should run I decided to leave my husband who was traveling to Prague and try to catch my flight. The trouble was that few steps later there was a different zone of the airport, then I had to go through train and security check, being out of breath when I finally came to the gate it was 9:50 AM and my flight had already left. The lady at the desk said that she is not willing to help me and I should go back to the service desk and change my ticket. In the lounge, they changed my ticket to 12:40 pm. Same time was the flight time for my husband, but as he was flying to Prague, and me to Moscow, we had to stay in different airport zones and were not able to come to each other. When I was boarding the plane, there was no walkway, but a bus, and they were saying that business goes after families with children to the bus. And the employee on the desk was extremely rude, screaming at business passengers they should wait till all children go the bus first. On the plane, the seats were not even with adjustable head. We had to wait for 45 minutes (plus to 4h flight) for some luggage to be loaded-unloaded and for some passenger to come to the plane. During this extra time of waiting in the aircraft there were no drinks offered. ",,Couple Leisure,Business Class,ORD to DME via FRA,January 2017,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1,no
"""experience is truly special""",10,Charles Walsh,5th January 2017,"✅ Verified Review |  Newark to Dusseldorf. Only through the grace of about a billion points was I able to snag a Newark to Dusseldorf reward flight to experience Lufthansa’s renowned First Class on my way to a final destination of Lisbon. I felt somewhat unworthy as I settled myself into my 2A open suite, however, I worked hard to maintain the requisite “I belong here” demeanor, unlike the fellow in front of me who danced in the aisle, champagne flute in hand, celebrating after his boss switched seats with him (boss relocating to Business). The A340-600 First Class cabin was full. I spent the first fifteen minutes sipping champagne, enjoying macadamia nuts, and playing with what seemed like several hundred seating variations from which to choose. Service, food and beverage was for the most part stellar although once it was ‘lights out’, our two attendants did somewhat of a disappearing act, although I’m sure they would have been prompt if I had rang for service. The dinner service was outstanding, caviar first course, followed by a trio of appetizers, lobster main, chocolate dessert, complimented with some excellent tasting wines, and all served course by course on a well-sized and nicely laid out dining table. An after-dinner aperitif coupled with a cappuccino (and a few more sweets thrown in for good measure) concluded a wonderful dining experience. Seats were promptly converted into comfortable looking beds with myself as the only hold-out. With privacy dividers raised, the group settled into a state of individual slumber. I chose to catch up on a few recent-run films through the night. A perfect photo-op of a sunrise appeared much too early, as did the perfectly prepared breakfast offering of smoked salmon and scrambled eggs, freshly squeezed orange juice and coffee.  Finishing my breakfast, I changed back into my streets in the very spacious and clean washroom. There was a noticeable lack of interaction with the flight crew. Except for the obligatory “Willkommen to, Danke für” announcements from the flight deck, nothing else was offered. Perhaps the pilots were feeling miffed with their airline, and working to rule, choosing not to associate with even the first class passengers as has apparently happened in the past. The Lufthansa First Class experience is truly special, and not only the in-flight portion, but the other touches such as personal escort from check-in, past security, and into the lounge, as well as the lounges themselves, the service and amenities offered on either continent. As I left the sanctity of the First Class section, a sense of claustrophobia overwhelmed me and I realized I was turning my nose up at Lufthansa Business Class! And, as I sat in TAP Business on my flight segment to Lisbon, with my all-on-one lunch tray crowding my thirty four inches of pitch, I reflected on how fortunate I was to have experienced the Lufthansa First Class product.

"""bad ground customer service""",4,K Teaken,4th January 2017,"✅ Verified Review |  Toronto to Pune via Frankfurt. We arrived late on the Air Canada flight from YYZ to FRA and missed our connecting Lufthansa flight to PNQ. There was no special arrangement to hurry the transit passengers to their flight. We had to wait for 3 busses to be filled as we were parked on the tarmac, prior to moving to the gate. Upon reaching the gate, we checked with the ground staff available and they told us to rush to the specified gate for our flight. We had to walk there, which we did, along with other passengers. By the time we reached the gate after going through Security, it was 5 minutes to the departure time - we were told that the flight had departed and we had to walk back to the customer service counter from where we had come for additional assistance. They advised us that they had not been intimated that we were on our way to catch the flight (along with 2 other passengers), even though we had our boarding cards. The Lufthansa ground staff insisted that it was the fault of Air Canada as the flight was operated by them.  They said the earliest connecting flight was at 7:00 am the next morning via Delhi. I had to remind them that there was an earlier one LH0760, which they agreed to put us on. They got us the tickets and told us to rush to the terminal to catch the flight before it left. We asked for a cart and were told none was available (we happened to get on the cart which the other 2 passengers who had also missed the flight were given by another ground staff). We had to go through Security again and had issues with the alcohol we had purchased in Toronto.  We requested an upgrade due to our exhaustion and inconvenience, which was refused. We got a call from a customer service representative who told us to contact Air Canada for our issues at they had operated the flight from YYZ to FRA.

"""about the experience and the swag""",10,M Norton,3rd January 2017,"✅ Verified Review |  New York to Milan via Frankfurt. Seat 1A in First class. This was a special trip to Northern Italy for Christmas with my extended family and an Aeroplan reward ticket. We left pretty close to on time and they made up time on the way over. As soon as we boarded, I changed into the pyjamas and settled in for the overnight flight. Champagne and macadamias arrived quickly and on the seat was the Rimowa amenity kit. Meal service was delicious from the amuse bouche, caviar, black pepper pasta and I think it was chocolate bread pudding, though I was so full I couldn't. The wonderful champagne, I had the old world red and a lovely port. The crew on board couldn't do enough for us yet it still felt really private with a full cabin. After dinner, they made up the bed with a comfy top and bottom duvet and I got almost 5 hours of sleep. Breakfast was fresh and wonderful, I ate light as I had a 6 hour connection in Frankfurt before flying to Milan. My favourite part of flying first on Lufthansa is the First Class Terminal in Frankfurt. This is a separate building with no gates attached. You walk out the main terminal doors and turn left and it's a five minute walk. Take the elevator up and they personally take care of you from then on. You can do this not only as a departing but as an arriving first class passenger too. The whole place is bar, they have a smoking room with, and I don't smoke them but my friends would love the cigars. Shower/bathrooms, private snooze rooms and comfy wing chairs and ottomans to sit and read a book. One of the three bathrooms has not only a shower but a full on soaker tub too. I booked it and read my book until my time came. Lufthansa understands that some of us still love to fly and it's about the experience and the swag. Sitting on the bath tub was another collectible Lufthansa First Class Terminal rubber ducky to add the collection. I had a delicious breakfast in the a la carte restaurant, the mimosas and long espressos were great too. It was Christmas after all and vacation. When time came to board they escorted me downstairs to a waiting limo (they have a fleet of Mercedes, Audi, BMW and Porsche vehicles from sedans to SUV's). They drive you across the tarmac to your next flight. I find it hard to fault Lufthansa these days, I like the whole experience in the air and on the ground. There are rumours that LH will discontinue first from North America, I hope not.

My flight to Frankfurt was just a few hours away when I got a text that the other leg of my journey from Frankfurt to Boston had been cancelled. I could not afford to be stranded in Frankfurt and nearing panic and desperate, I managed to book another flight through British Airways which would land me in Boston just a few hours later than the cancelled Lufthansa flight. So seventeen hundred dollars and a lot of heartache later, I finally landed in Boston. The following day, I decided to reach out to Lufthansa customer service to inquire about my refund for my cancelled flight. A curt lady told me that the refund was in process and would take anywhere from a couple of days to a week to go through, but she would not divulge the amount to me. I went ahead and told her that I had spent $1700 to rebook my flight just so I could be back in time for my wife's surgery at which point I was told, and I quote - ""that was your decision and your problem. We are not liable for it"". So, was it my fault that Lufthansa decided to cancel my flight because of the pilot strike which is their own internal problem? And they have had this issue for years; their cabin crew and pilots have gone on impromptu strikes for the past couple of years now and the ones to suffer are the gullible passengers. Lufthansa reported recorded profits this year and it is not hard to imagine where most of that money came from: their gullible customers who they so merrily swindle at every opportunity. The only reason that I have posted this review is that I do not want another person to go through what me (and probably thousands of others) have suffered at the hands of this inconsiderate and greedy airline. I would dearly suggest to you that if you are booking your flight at least a month in advance, you are better off going with a more stable airline, as Lufthansa is very unpredictable and can cancel flights and leave passengers stranded with no recourse whatsoever.

The return flight was quite different, it started with Lufthansa canceling our flights on one date and telling us we would have to leave a day earlier or a day later the problem was I would either have to pay for an additional day which was not available - so I opted to leave a day early which meant I was out a days room rent, which is not cheap. We were also bought our tickets 6 months in advance and paid extra for seats in the front of the plane. On the flights they put us on we were in the back of the plane, telling us it didn't matter that we paid for advanced seating, that only meant you were paying for window or aisle - really - we paid $180.00 extra for a window or aisle seat.

Flight from LHR to FRA departed on time. It was a short flight and we received snacks. Cabin was clean, crew very polite and professional. Arrival in FRA was on schedule. Transfer in FRA took more than 2 hours so there was plenty of time of getting to the required gate. Boarding started on time. The only little con, however, was that we were taken to the plane by bus, despite the fact that it was an A340-300. Cabin crew welcomed us with smiles. The plane from FRA to PTY also departed on time. Throughout the whole flight crew was present and did their best to make us feel as comfy as possible. There were 2 hot meals, snacks and plenty of drinks. What I can recommend Lufthansa, though, is to enlarge an IFE choice, especially the movie collection.

"""Premium Economy was not as good as other airlines""",6,G Pearson,31st October 2016,"✅ Verified Review |  This was my first flight on Lufthansa flying from Osaka to London Heathrow via Frankfurt. I booked Premium Economy as I usually do on other airlines where available. Overall, I thought that whilst the flight was comfortable and reasonable value, the Lufthansa Premium Economy was not as good as other airlines that I have used. There was just a few rows within the Economy class and the only thing to differentiate Premium Economy from Economy was the seats and legroom (which were fine I might add). The food was the same as Economy (very average both ways even by Economy standards although printed on a different Premium Economy menu), shared the same stewards on board and at check-in and boarding there was no separate boarding queue for Premium Economy. Whilst these are not big issues at all I do feel that for paying twice the airfare they might have offered slightly more to differentiate it from Economy.

A delicious veg curry, plenty of fruit, some really good bread and cheese. Plenty juice and water offered throughout the flight, plus a weird tasting cookie at one point.

I've had the 'pleasure' of flying Lufthansa Airbus A380-800 in economy cabin and it was a horrible experience, unfortunately flying with business is a similar experience. One of the worst business class cabins I've flown - seats are narrow and tight, if you do not get a window seat there's no storage space at all for anything (window seats come with additional storage space along the fuselage) so every time you have to get up and reach the overhead bin. Film selection is so-so, the only positive side are the noise cancelling headphones. Food was average at best, service was mixed - the flight attendant taking care of my section was great, smiling, friendly and speaking English. I've noticed that on numerous Lufthansa flights that cabin crew first of all has this cold business attitude and tends to speak German, even if you speak to them in English. The second leg was ok, with a typical short haul flight seat, space and service - nothing special worth mentioning. At that point I would also suggest to avoid travelling through Frankfurt as this airport is a disgrace with rude and puzzled personnel and long waiting lines.

"""PE well worth the extra cost""",9,Mark West,12th June 2016,"✅ Verified Review | Frankfurt to Addis Ababa with Lufthansa. The connection in FRA is laborious and involves lots of walking. I took a leisurely stroll directly from my arriving flight to the gate (stopping for a little shopping for around 10 minutes) and altogether it took almost an hour to navigate through the airport, the mono-rail, the security checks, the other security checks and then to the gate. That said, when I arrived at the gate, boarding had just been called so the timing was, in fact perfect. I am impressed with the number of people on the ground to assist you with the transit. It seems there are no end of red-jacketed people to see that you go in the right direction. The crew were very welcoming and bright. Before take off a welcome drink of minty orange juice was offered in plastic wine-style glasses. After take off menu cards were distributed and pre-dinner drinks offered. They commenced with the meal service a little while later but had to abandon it due to turbulence. A helpful announcement was made, apologising for the delay. Two choices of main course were offered which were served on china and with metal cutlery. Red or white wine was offered from a full size bottle with water (sparkling or still). I have a little gripe with the way the service is ordered as I have noticed that on every flight a refill of wine is not offered until just before the coffee service. I would like to be offered a second glass of wine with my meal. After coffee (quite a long while after) after-dinner drinks (Cognac or Baileys). I asked for a refill of coffee at this point – it came about 10 mins later. A chocolate was also offered. Prior to landing in Jeddah (refuelling and crew change) a small half-sandwich was offered (no choice) and this was followed by a glass of orange juice served from a tray. Another gripe is that there is no tidy-up of the cabin during the re-fuelling stop. There were vast numbers of strewn blankets, discarded cups and every conceivable wrapper strewn all across the cabin and they remained there for the rest of the flight to Addis. I don’t really understand why either the departing crew don’t do a once-over, or a cleaning crew pop on board to do a quick tidy while we were on the ground. Overall, I like the LH PE service. I do not have other PE products to compare it with, but for me, it does what it says on the tin. Gives that little bit more attention and comfort to the economy traveller.

The highlight was the plane change at FRA where we arrived at around gates A1-A2 by bus, walked all the way to gate A69 in the newest terminal extension (T1) and realized that we're bussed back to around gates A1-A2 where the A321 to Helsinki was waiting for us. 9/10 for their solid performance and 4/10 for the transfer arrangements between flights, it was so hot and unpleasant in the buses.",A319 / CRJ900 / A321,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,HEL to DRS via MUC,April 2016,4.0,5.0,5.0,,2.0,5,yes

I do get that fly attendants are not waiters but trained professional here to assure our security, but having them smile is much appreciated. We were a bit late, it may be only 20 minutes but it shortened my connecting time. Second flight from Frankfurt to Hong Kong was not good. Being served last and not having a choice of meal is something I do not care about. I was pretty close to the galley and could hear FA's chatting/giggling very loudly for most of the flight, and they should have cared a bit more. Most of them were quite cold and they were not serving drinks enough. The seats weren't comfortable, and once the front seat reclines it feels way too cramped, I was surprised it could be reclined that much. Sit back and enjoy the Lufthansa entertainment programme is more like sit back and enjoy your own device.

Also that they could either take the luggage or the passengers.  However, it went from bad to worse as it has been 2 days and my luggage still hasn't arrived. Well, it did - at 1am this morning but was taken away when nobody answered the door. How very selfish of me not cooperating with the courier for being awake at 1am following a long haul flight.

I was most impressed with service, the FAs kept to high standards, with service in an non-intrusive manner and a sense of humor.

Staff were not particularly apologetic at LCY, just herded people to fill out forms and promised bags will be delivered by next morning, which turned out to be a lie as bags still have not turned up yet the next evening. They outsourced this task to an appalling company that even they can not contact as they never pick the phone up or respond to emails.

Find the seats very comfy and like the colour scheme. Was greeted by a friendly flight attendant on entering the aircraft. Shortly after that greeted by name by the purser. Welcome drink was served by your 'new' personal flight attendant. On this route LH has introduced the enhanced restaurant service. Guess it is a very nice new touch but it didn't work out at all on this flight. Seemed like it was the first time for the team as the purser kept telling them what to do and they seemed pretty overwhelmed with the additional work. Overwhelmed and stressed with a warm smile though. The restaurant service will probably be a nice addition once the crews are trained. Other than that it was another great flight experience. Have been a Senator with Lufthansa for almost 15 years. After some years if downgrading I am very happy to see how much they have improved their entire product.

Onboard the A380 the premium economy cabin is separated from economy cabin which is very nice and creates a more exclusive touch.

I had pre-ordered a meal, but the cabin crew did not notice it. Thus I had to ask and wait my meal. The seat was good and comfortable. I could recline it much more to the back.

I was informed that my Contract with Lufthansa ended in Bangkok as my connection was booked separately with Thai Airways and not through Lufthansa.  I had  to go to customer service online or look for Thai Airways staff in Bangkok. When I tried to explain to him that it is basic courtesy that he or someone in Frankfurt office communicates this to their Bangkok office in advance, so I don’t have to go looking for their representative at midnight after a long flight, I was informed this is not possible as they had given me an airport hotel voucher in Frankfurt for the delay and had met their obligation and their contract ended the moment I landed in Bangkok. I re-iterated that all I wanted was that they communicate to their team at the other end, so whatever solution they have can be pre-planned, as it was Lufthansa fault. However, it proved too difficult for the counter person to comprehend, and I had to ask for his supervisor, who seemed to understand and agreed to inform their Bangkok team.

We decided on the Thai Royal Orchid lounge as opposed to the United Airlines option. Lounge not too busy, varied choice of food. I had dim sum and spicy soup, sandwiches and a glass of white wine. Sadly there is no champagne in the Thai lounge at HKG nor any choice of wine other than red or white. Nevertheless, we enjoyed the experience and the gate was not too far away. Boarding was orderly, despite the best efforts of some passengers who clearly didn't understand the logistics involved in boarding the A380. We were amongst the first to board and received a warm welcome from the cabin crew and we were addressed by name during the service. Pre-take off drinks were offered including sparkling wine and an amenity kit, slippers and a bottle of water were in the seat pocket. After take off drinks included champagne with a smile and the dinner service was excellent, the scallops and chicken with rice dish was very tasty and the crew were charming. Dinner was rounded off with cheese and port and then coffee and a rather nice Cognac. The seat when fully reclined was comfortable and felt more roomy than the Swiss seat/bed I had on the outbound and I managed to sleep for a few hours undisturbed. The cabin on the A380 was noticeably quiet, maybe because Business class is upstairs. A hearty hot breakfast was served which was tasty and ample. An excellent flight with a stellar crew. Quick disembarkation at FRA and we made our way to the quiet Senator lounge prior to our, not cancelled flight to London City. The flight was very full because many of the mainline flights to Heathrow were cancelled. This short flight was another enjoyable one with a personable crew and a quite filling continental breakfast of cold cuts, cheese, fruit and pastries. The usual bus to the terminal but at least there were the e-gates so not much waiting at immigration and our bags were waiting for us on the carousel.

Also, they seem too few, so queues build up after diner and before breakfast and landing, crowding the cabin and making it busy.

Upon her arrival in Singapore I called Lufthansa to file a complaint and was met with the instruction to do this via the website. I did that and got an automatic reply. Since then (now 14 days ago) I have heard nothing from Lufthansa. On her departure from Singapore I was guaranteed that my mother would have access to the business class lounge in Frankfurt on her transfer back to Karlstad as a compensation for their mistake on her outbound journey. (The thing is that there is no business class on the flight from Frankfurt to Karlstad so even though I booked a business class ticket I couldn't get any on that leg).

Seating and lounge position was very comfortable. Screen is nice and entertainement had plenty of options to choose from. Only minus in my opinion is the lack of stowage and the rather small seat width around the shoulders when fully reclined. The issue with the feet being close to the neighbour didn't really disturb me. Food was good but not excellent. Crew was great. Had about 7 hours of sleep and arrived well rested.

Our row was directly behind row 44, which is the bulkhead row. Sitting there, I expect that there may be a baby or two seated in front of us, but not five (5) as was the case on this flight. As the plane attained altitude the woman in front of us changed her baby's diaper in the seat. The staff softly mentioned to her that changing should be done in the restrooms, and then proceeded to reward her behavior with a multitude of gifts for her two children. The children acted out, screaming and yelling, setting off the other children in the row during the entire flight. They were continually rewarded with extra attention from the flight attendants, while we struggled to get their attention for basic service. Surely five is too many young children too be in one row, making the flight a miserable experience for everyone seated around them. Lufthansa needs to disperse the children on any flight, so they don't constitute a critical mass of misery for all the paying passengers around them. At the very least, all other passengers should get their fair share of attention from the flight staff.

Thanks to my Star Alliance Gold membership I was able to use the first class check in, which was very nice. Staff really friendly and helpful. In contrast to that however, was the receptionist at the lounge. She was grumpy and unfriendly. The lounge was rather crowded. Food selection was OK and there was a rather vast selection of beverages available which was nice. DUS to FRA is too short for any kind of service for economy class. The hardware is the Lufthansa hardware for short haul flights. Nice and comfy for short flights. Transfer in Frankfurt was unpleasant due to the long walking distance. I went directly to the gate where the boarding procedures were comencing shortly after. I was able to use priority but the procedure seemed very smooth. Shortly after take off menus were distributed, however, only to some of the economy class passenger. Also, there was no choice between food options later on. I know some passenger had a different menu. Crackers and drinks were served. I ordered water and tomato juice, but my juice was forgotten and I was left with only salt and pepper until I had to remind the FA. Approxmately 3hrs after take off dinner was served.  Food was tasty, and the portion itself was comparable to other economy classes. The seat comfort was better than I had expected. The seats recline nicely and there is a decent amount of legroom available. When I wasn't enjoying the new very good entertainment system I was able to catch some good sleep. During flight, the FA served water and juice and there was a self service bar for drinks and crackers in the galley. Shortly before arriving for a technical stop in Kuala Lumpur breakfast was served.

Our seat choices were honoured as well. Food was edible but bland. What impressed me was how Lufthansa dealt with a delay issue (not LH fault) by proactively booking passengers through on alternates while we were still airborne to FRA. What didn't impress me was the lack of enforcement of cabin baggage rules on the US-EU sector, if you werent on the plane in the first 10 minutes of boarding, you had nowhere to put luggage due to all the maximum sized carry ons already occupying the overheads.

Before the flight, I visited the First Class Terminal. Having been there a few years before, it's amazing how Lufthansa keeps the service at such a high level. When the plane was ready to board, I was driven to the 747-8 with a Porsche Cayenne. First Class has eight seats, however, on this flight it was only one other passenger and myself. From the moment I boarded the plane, two flight attendants looked after us for the next 14 hours. The seat has to be the most comfortable on any plane these days. I sat on 2A, which is my favourite. Lufthansa did a really amazing job. The amenity kit might not be as luxurious as on other carriers, but it was good for me. They gave me a Pyjama from van Laack in which I could sleep. The food was superb and I was served several starters. One of the flight attendants offered to prepare another main dish if I didn't like the course I ordered. It was followed by desserts and pralines. The service was very kind and attentive without being intrusive.  IFE was great and had a fairly large selection of movies, tv shows, music and other things. When I was ready to sleep, the flight attendant made the bed on the seat behind me (3A). The bedding was almost as good as a regular one from home. They also put something like a mattress on the seat to make it more comfortable. I asked to be woken up two hours before landing in Buenos Aires and so I was.  On this flight, the purser came around three times to check on me and the other passenger.

Lufthansa’s ambition is to become Europe’s first five-star airline and measured by the new C-Class service concept, they will get there. The service was impeccable with the flight attendants competently managing the fine line between attentive and personal helpfulness and care – and well-meant, if imposing suffocation of passengers. Kudos to the cabin staff. The food was the well-tasting and delicious food, best I’ve had on a long-haul flight, wines were excellent too. The cabin was well-appointed, colours pleasant, and lots of space for your carry-on luggage. The IFE programme was impressive (but this has become an industry standard, I guess), including the large screens. The not-quite-so-new fully reclineable (‘lie-flat’) seats have been described by others. Since I’ve been flying on the South American services, which appeared to be the last to receive these ‘new’ seats, it was still a new experience for me. Hence a couple of words about the seats: they are certainly not bad. The foot-end is rather narrow – perhaps too narrow for comfort – and I don’t really understand the reasoning behind it. Space in general does not seem to be missing. Another minor issue is the compartment under the in-seat entertainment monitor. This is where you find your kit with socks, toiletries etc. In our case, you couldn’t close it properly, simply because it seemed to be poorly made (I’ve noticed it on a recent 747-8 flight, too). Flying on the world’s biggest and heaviest passenger plane and then not being able to shut a compartment box somehow feels silly.

On the short flight to Munich from Frankfurt, we were served Leibniz Minis during boarding and inflight, were served only drinks. This wouldn't happen on an American based airline. Once in Munich, you have to walk to the ""H gates"" for flights to USA, which means you have to go through passport control. For my flight to Newark, you have to go through another security screening right near the gate, where you and your carry-on bag are thorougly searched. The A340-600 is a beautiful aircraft and the flight could not have gone better. All the flight attendants  were attentive, very friendly, and spoke mostly English on flight to Newark. You were served many choices of drinks throughout the flight, given crackers, meal choice was between Cheese Ravioli with Spinach and Beef, and were later given something before arrival. The seats were comfortable and inflight entertainment had a good selection of movies, shows, games, and music. My only two issues were at check in, you do everything yourself (weighing, tagging, and placing luggage on belt) and during boarding, it was pretty chaotic.

Lufthansa customer review,2,Lee Clutterbuck,11th August 2015,"We were told at checkin that out 5 and 6 year old children would be in separate seats across the plane as there were insufficient adjoining seats. Traveling with young children is stressful for any family, but traveling next to unrelated unsupervised kids is surely most people's idea of hell. After 45 mins of arguing we finally managed to secure two pairs of seats in different sections of the plane, sandwiched between strangers. I know it is the modern way to extract every dollar out of the customer through random taxes and numerous surcharges, but it doesn't make any sense to scatter family members throughout the plane.  Maybe Lufthansa should automatically allocate seats for families with young children or be transparent and honest about hidden costs of securing seats. I'm not sure the current policy is very customer inspired for the family traveller or the individual that could be sittings next to an unsupervised, emotional and tired young child.

Lufthansa customer review,10,Bojan Tercon,10th August 2015,"Lufthansa's first class product is truly world class. Flying in seat 1A on the 747-8i from Frankfurt to New York was like sitting in a decked out BMW. Everything in the cabin exuded luxury and precise German engineering. The leather of the seat and the console. The seat movements were effortless. The table slid in and out from the side console without any resistance. It is a quality product. Even the details in the bathroom made it a pleasure to hang out there. Although the cabin has a very open feel, unlike the very private suites on Singapore Airlines or Emirates, there is a side panel that you can lift that creates enough privacy if you so desire it. The catering was superb, as was the service. European professionalism with class. Add to that the First Class Terminal in Frankfurt and the drop-off to the plane in a white Porsche, and you get a Top 3 global first class product. If I had to change one thing, it would be the video screen. It’s far too small for a product like this. It doesn’t do justice to the rest of the cabin.

Staff are friendly and attentive. Seats were comfortable, and needed to be so, as Lufthansa seem to have a unique way of putting a plane down quite hard onto the runway. My only criticism is with the lack of organisation at the check-in gates, with flights sometimes not being called properly so that passengers mill around not knowing what is going on. This aspect is even worse when things go wrong, as they often do on the trip to and from Salzburg as a result of delays and cancellations due to adverse weather.

Lufthansa customer review,7,Michael Bucka,27th July 2015,"LH145 - 06/07/2015, A319. Easy boarding Process in Nuremberg, friendly staff on board. After arriving in Frankfurt, due to short connection, direct transfer with a limousine was already organized. LH440 - 06/07/2015, A380. Unfortunately when arriving at the gate to Houston, plane was delayed due to technical issues. Ground staff were confused, delayed the boarding twice. Boarding started about 45 min later than normal. Due to the amount of seats in business class, there were already 2 lines of about 40 people each for the boarding process. When boarding started the ground staff did that manually in only one line, without activating the two self service scanners. After 20 min I went to the purser and asked if she can assist me with boarding (First/Sen). She told me the boarding process had already started (sure, I was waiting there) and I can board after queuing in the line. After I asked why the scanners were not activated, she looked confused around and asked some colleagues, who then activated the scanners, which gave me the possibility to board. Unfortunately already a lot of people from Economy had boarded, which caused a delay on the stairs to the two bridges (First/Business and Economy). Overall my worst boarding process flying First with LH. Welcome on board was great, service and food thru the entire flight the same. Great people and a big thank you to the team of LH. The pilot could not catch up, so when we landed in Houston and the door opened, I had 10 minutes connection time to the boarding to TPA on C34.

Flight delayed 30 mins due to late arrival from previous sector. Nice, but not overly friendly cabin crew. Only one FA looked presentable, others looked shabby and tired, but still, they always smiled. Nothing special about food - little tray with hot pasta, one bread roll and tiny Mars bar. Boring.

Gate to Munich is right next to the Lounge. Warm welcome from the ground staff, excellent food and wine. Easy boarding process for First Class due to a direct door from the lounge to the jet bridge of the plane. Very warm welcome from the cabin team. Very good food on board with excellent Service. One hour before landing I got my wake up call with a easy and lite breakfast. Overall a great flight. Easy and fast Immigration in Munich with Custom/Federal Police office in the Lufthansa Lounge.

Lufthansa customer review,2,Thor Kristjanson,25th July 2015,"On Tuesday 7th of July 2015 we checked in to flight LH1285 to Frankfurt from Athens. When entering the aircraft we noticed that the seats in Business Class were the same as in economy and the legroom was the same. The seats were uncomfortable. Usually when you come into Business Class in an airplane you are greeted with a drink (water, juice or wine), but not on that flight. The stewardess did not pay much attention to us. No english newspapers. We had a little boy with us (8 years old) and when his mother asked for a pillow and blanket, only 2 pillows where found in the whole plane and 2 blankets. We waited a long time until food service started, even economy passengers in back of us got service before us. We were served 20 min later. As I said before the seats were very uncomfortable and as I am not a small man I could not put the tray all the way down because the legroom between the seats was not that much. 7th July 2015, Frankfurt to Keflavik Iceland, flight LH856. The same poor quality seats. We asked for a pillow and a blanket but there was only one blanket and no pillows in the whole plane. The reason we were given was that the plane came in over night and all blankets and pillows were used! The stewardess onboard was very nice and tried to calm me down, the reason she said that the seats weren´t better than this was that the flight was short haul. I fly all over Europe at least 15 times a year and everywhere, the Business Class has better seats.

Lufthansa customer review,3,K Nyman Metcalf,24th July 2015,"Lufthansa used to be the best European airline, not least due to their care for ensuring connections even in case of delays. I am very disappointed that this appears to now be history. As a business class traveller with a Senator (Gold) card I would expect the best treatment so if I am treated as I have recently been, what must it be like for other customers? 1 hour delay from London Heathrow (about 30 minutes on arrival to Frankfurt), no busses there to meet the flight I guess is airport rather than airline problem. No information on the flight, the head purser first doubted that what I said about my onward flight, gave some wrong information and was later very rude as well as claimed that it is not Lufthansa´s task to give information (on a Lufthansa connection with a Lufthansa ticket?) this is most definitely a problem of the airline. With a direct transfer I would have made it, now it was a night in Frankfurt instead and arrival 13 hours late. Add to the misery that I was finally told, by the pilots, that I should hurry to the gate, although when I arrived the flight had left long ago so all the running was a total waste. Recently (end March 2015) on a late arrival from Amman to London, again with a Lufthansa through (business class) ticket via Frankfurt, I made it (running) to the gate for the next flight but no rebooking had been made and again, no information whatsoever from the flight crew. I am afraid Lufthansa is rapidly ceasing to be my first choice. What a shame, when only better information would deal with this problem. The very value for money that I used to appreciate - pay more but get something for it - rapidly slips with such treatment.",,Business,Business Class,London Heathrow to Tallinn via Frankfurt,July 2015,4.0,1.0,4.0,,1.0,3,no

Connecting in FRA extremely stressful (this airport is now worse than CDG), I had 60 mn to do it. It took 30 mins only to arrive at terminal, due to very very remote parking plus a lot of airplane traffic that stopped our bus. Then a long queue at Immigration, and very remote finger (Z62). Boarding had started when I arrived. Service on upper deck (FRA to KIX) was pleasant but slow, the food was delicious. Brand new flat seats, a bit too narrow, but pleasant anyway.

She was helped into her seat by the very friendly cabin crew who escorted her from the aircraft entrance and I was helped with my onboard luggage. During the flight the flight attendants helped my mother with the food, something that I greatly appreciated. Upon arrival in Frankfurt we were met by very friendly and professional Lufthansa ground services personnel who escorted her and myself all the way to the Sheraton Airport hotel as there was a 12 hour wait between both flights and later came to the hotel to pick us up for our onward journey.

When we got the the airport the lines for check in were long so we all went to the online check in counter and they allowed us to check in. Flight on time and boarding was quick. They serve a horrible roll after take off at 1am which was inedible. Seats quite uncomfortable. Headsets can hardly hear and this looked like a new aircraft. Crew was pleasant enough. Overall uneventful flight. Landed in MUC on time with a 40 minute connection and had to run for our next flight which we made with moments to spare. LH did nothing to make the connection easier which they so proudly advertise.

Lufthansa is clean, efficient and friendly. The seats were very comfortable, screen was big and food was ok. I slept for a straight 8hr and my wife slept 9.5hrs.

Breakfast served was okay and service was nice on this 3 hour flight. Got to FRA with a 2 hour connection. Had to get from one end of the terminal to the other and we kind of ran as we were a bit lost. Got to our gate and sat down to wait. After 30 minutes of waiting and near the boarding time I went to the desk to ask the status and was told we were delayed 3 hours. They did not tell passengers unless they asked and they never showed any change of timing on the information boards. LH then started handing out 5 euro meal vouchers- nothing in the canteen nearby was available to eat for 5 euros! Flight finally left 4 hours late and arrived at 5am in Mumbai instead of 1am.

Lufthansa customer review,8,T Eldem,20th July 2015,"Check-in and boarding were efficient. On board it was a fresh looking A330 with new Business Class seats. These are an improvement over the older angled seats but they are inferior to pods found on other carriers. In the fully flat position there is little space for your feet and overall, the seat is narrow. Flight left late due to congestion at FRA and arrived slightly behind schedule. The service was fairly attentive with FA's smiling throughout the flight. The appetizer was delicious but my lunch selection was overcooked and was quite bland. There were a wide selection of spirits and drinks to choose from and the wines served were fairly good. Pre-arrival meal was tasty and the portions were quite big. The IFE had a poor selection of movies and lacked in the number of new releases for both movies and music although the Bose noise-cancelling headphones were a nice touch.

No seating was available at the gate. It was a mater of just wait and don't block the passageway. No information was given on board about the connecting flights. No effort was made to fast track passengers to make connecting flights. Enroute to the gate to get the Johannesburg flight we were informed by other passengers that the flight had left. Again there were no announcements. No Lufthansa representative was assigned to deal with passengers that were stranded. The group was split as some passengers did not have visas to enter Germany. After much walking and asking random people what to do, we found a service desk with staff willing to assist. This was also stressful as it was late and everyone was going off shift. The airport was near deserted except for the confused and stressed passengers, some of whom were travelling with small children. We were given a taxi, hotel and meal vouchers for the overnight stay. We had no luggage so a change of clothes and toiletries were an issue. We have been re-routed via Lagos with a 6 hour layover.

Lufthansa customer review,7,Margot Love,19th July 2015,My original flight for my return to NZ was to Shanghai however due to Thunderstorms at Frankfurt the Paris flight was delayed and arrived an hour and a half late causing missed connection to Shanghai. Hope was given to us by the crew as they said everything was delayed and so we had a good chance but this was a false hope. On the Paris flight the English announcements were hard to hear as the sound was not turned up loud enough to overcome all those that had understood the German announcement and were now talking loudly. Attendants on Dubai flight were friendly and professional. There was mixed customer care when hundreds filed in to the customer service area. Some received overnight kits some received juice and water and some did not. The processing of people got faster when a second area opened up downstairs. Again mixed customer service. I got great service with all vouchers explained as well as clearly written on what was what as well as a meal voucher where as a lady I buddied up with didn't get as good service and no meal voucher. On return to Frankfurt airport the next day for rebooking great professional staff sorting out re ticketing of new flights. Accommodation was supplied in Frankfurt and also at layover on Dubai.

Once on board the aircraft was in pristine condition. As it was not a full flight I moved into a row all to myself and had a very comfortable journey. The FA's were not particularly friendly and performed the inflight service like preprogrammed robots. The dinner served was fairly basic but quite tasty.

Transfer at Frankfurt is complicated and long, compared with for example, Schipol, but better than Paris. All flights pretty full - but full compliments to Lufthansa cabin crew, very friendly and attentive given busy short haul flights. Complete punctuality. Also, a nice touch that pilot comes out of cockpit to say goodbye to passengers at end of flight. In contrast to Heathrow, check in at Barcelona extremely quick and efficient.

Lufthansa customer review,1,Tan Eng Hui ,16th July 2015,"My family took a long haul flight with Lufthansa to Berlin via Frankfurt. They only give us a transit time of 1 hour 5 mins. By the time we came down from the plane at Frankfurt, I happened to look up at a clock in the airport, and it was already 20 minutes into the transit time. We walked to the gate, and it was a long walk. An airport staff member stopped the whole group of passengers from going down to the immigration clearing area, which we had to pass through before we can reach our gate for the connecting flight to Berlin. He just said the area downstairs was too crowded, so we cannot go down. He held us up for 10-15 mins. Finally, we were allowed to go down, and there were only 6 staff doing the immigration clearance (as compared to over ten in Heathrow airport). That takes another 10 minutes or so. In the end, we reached our gate 2 mins late, and the plane had left without us. After that, customer service was non-existent. This is no fault of ours. They could not put us onto the next few flights as they were all full. We were told to go to the gate to wait and enquire if any passengers didn't show up. We tried this for one flight, and I refused to do it again. The next available flight was 5 hours later. But we would have reached Berlin too late for us to take another connecting flight to London. I have booked this BA flight some 4 hours plus after our supposed arrival time in Berlin. Yet we had to miss it. To add to the insult, we were told we had to take the flight to Berlin, or they would re-calculate the total cost.

We can understand this the first time, but the second time it happened we didn’t get to choose our food, we felt being treated unfairly, and to us it clearly showed that Lufthansa did not care about attending to customers’ needs and respecting their right of choice. We paid our fares as everyone else! It is not about we really have to have that particular food, it’s about the fact this happened twice in a row and obviously did not respect customers choice.

Lufthansa customer review,5,Tim Rupert,4th July 2015,"This was our first time flying Lufthansa. While the organization that paid for my flight booked an economy ticket, I noticed the opportunity to bid on premium economy tickets for 3 of the 4 legs of our round-trip flights. Our bids were accepted for two of the flights, but not accepted for the third. Ironically, this is the one leg for which we had bid the most because we hadn't been able to secure good seats in the economy class. Even more ironic, when we checked in for this specific leg, we asked if there was an opportunity to upgrade class and we were able to do so at half the cost of what we had bid. Overall, the experience in premium economy was good. Much more room than the typical economy seat. But one leg was a bad experience. On the final leg, the seat map that we used to choose our seats was not accurate. It showed our two seats being in front of a set of bathrooms. When we boarded the plane, we found that our row was actually the first row after the bathrooms. Because we were on the side row, there was no wall or curtain between us and the bathroom. It essentially became a seven-hour flight sitting next to the bathroom. We would have been much better off with our original economy seats.

Lufthansa customer review,8,H Mutschler,23rd June 2015,"FRA to TLV. Arrived with LH train ticket via high-speed train in Frankfurt. On check in I asked for upgrade, since I have more than enough miles. Upgrade was granted and walked to their lounge in terminal C close to gate 14. This lounge looks like a more basic lounge and as it was before 10a,m the selection seemed limited. But after one hour we boarded the A321 for Tel Aviv. The plane is a basic Lufthansa plane for short haul, so there are no special Business class seats, only the middle seat is free, which gives you no more legroom. The crew was nice and served a pre-drink, as the flight was about 20 minutes late, due to high traffic in the air. Soon after take-off they served a nice Gin and Tonic with nuts. After that they started the food service on a tray. The food was nice with starter, salad, main dish and fruits. After that they served coffee and chocolate.

The seat was comfortable if sitting upright but less comfortable if you are trying to recline for your night sleep. Overhead storage cabins are sufficient unless your fellow passengers are selfish and store too much there. Plenty of leg room even if I store my bags up front (talking about the window seats though). Service quality by the staff (attitude, promptness and helpfulness) was 4 out of 5. As for meals I was highly impressed because of their setting.  Metal cutlery (not plastic), menu to read, delicate desserts, and nice dishware. Other than that, the food is OK, the dinner being good while breakfast was  poor.

Lufthansa customer review,8,Martin Tong,13th June 2015,"Quick day trip to Munich and impressed with Lufthansa, specially when compared to British Airways Club Europe. The LH lounge at T2 was wonderful, although crowded in early morning. The breakfast spread was fabulous by lounge standards. Staff told me the food is by Do & Co, and hope they can provide food to all LH lounges in future. Onboard service efficient and friendly staff, I like that they still offer you a good choice of magazines even on short flights. A light breakfast served, seats reasonably okay with middle seat empty. In MUC decided to try out the ""paid"" VIP Terminal on way back - wow! It is fabulous and even has its own beer garden and outside dining area. You get taken by car to foot of steps for boarding.

We did, 3 ground staff had to take care to rebook some 300 passengers - a most unpleasant experience. I am sure the staff did their best but Lufthansa for sure didn't.

Lufthansa customer review,2,Mary Bonner,6th June 2015,Flew round trip from Denver to Frankfurt in May. As noted in previous reviews service was curt lacking in smiles or friendliness. Return trip the bathroom was the dirtiest smelliest mess I have encountered on a plane. Is anyone responsible for checking it during the flight? I have very low expectations of food on airplanes but these meals were worst I've ever had. What really has made me decide to never fly Lufthansa again is this: I paid extra to reserve seats in the first row of economy which has a partition in front of you instead of a row of seats and more leg room. When we checked in for our return flight we were told those seats were not available. I was told by customer service that paying extra to reserve a seat gives you no guarantee or rights to those seats and my request for a refund was denied. Absolutely terrible customer service in my opinion.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,,2,no
Lufthansa customer review,4,Yevheniy Kahanovych,1st June 2015,I had 8 flights with Lufthansa last month on routes between London and Frankfurt Frankfurt and Gdansk (round- trip) Munich and Kiev (Round-trip) Frankfurt and Kiev (round-trip) Frankfurt and Gdansk (one way). Some flights were with City line subsidiary some with Lufthansa mainline. City line is better in terms of seat comfort (2-2 on Embraer aircraft plus good seat pitch) but no hot meal service. Lufthansa serves hot meal but seating is crowded and provides less comfort. Also City line crews mostly look disinterested. Ticket prices looked excellent value for money. A big letdown was Frankfurt airport experience. Not a single time had we embarkation or disembarkation via finger. Long bus rides only. To add insult to injury when boarding via bus they never used bus gates. We had 5 flights downstairs from Z gates designated for A380 only to stand for 25 minutes on the apron waiting for the bus to pick us up. Then 20 minutes on a bus standing and waiting for plane stand assignment. Overall very average. Flights are on time. Bags arrived safely.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,,4,yes

Well it wasn't bargain basement but a reasonable price. We had already enjoyed P/E on the way over to Europe so thought why not? P/E is well worthwhile and as mentioned for previous flights should be standard. It is just so more comfortable compared with economy but much more affordable than business. Food service all extremely good and IFE is now one of the best on any airline we have traveled with - fast and responsive with a good choice of channels.

The staff were extremely helpful. On my first flight there was a problem with my pre-booked seat so I called customer service to ensure my return flight would be correct. The lady whom I spoke to was very helpful and made sure I got the bassinet seat. For the long flight the staff had little Lufthansa toys they gave my baby I really appreciated the thought and had not experienced this with another airline we've flown with. Staff on board constantly checked on me to make sure I had everything I needed and to see if I needed any assistance (baby slept the whole flight).

As I was traveling alone with an 11-month old it was important I had the correct seat. The flight was fully booked but the staff were wonderful trying to help me out they managed to find a seat where a lady was willing to switch with me so I at least had the single empty seat beside me and my baby wasn't kicking somebody for 9 hours. The man in the seat ahead of me however reclined his seat fully back 10 minutes into the flight and refused to move it forward even for the meals the staff did their best to make me comfortable. Both at the airport and on-board the aircraft the staff did everything in their power to make my travels as easy as possible. The aircraft itself was new and clean. I am average sized and there would have been plenty of space had I not had another person on my lap. I only gave a lower rating for food as it tasted good enough but I am a picky eater.

Lufthansa customer review,6,A Palomo,27th May 2015,BHX-FRA-GIG 27/04/15. Return EZE-FRA-BHX 18/05/15. Flight from Birmingham with layover at Frankfurt then on to Rio De Janeiro was nearly faultless. Cabin crew were very attentive and friendly. The equipment used was 747-8 which was a delight fly on. Good selection of in-flight entertainment and food was also good. I asked for a pack of toothbrush and toothpaste and was given straightaway without questions asked and the lady FA had a friendly smile. Flight back from Buenos Aires was somewhat hit and miss. They were asking passengers for an upgrade for a minimum cost. I spent sometime travelling around South America and was down to my last few dollars so wasn't able to avail their promo. I found out later the they have upgraded quite a few passengers even though some of them were not frequent fliers. I am a Miles and More member and also I have got a frequent flier from SK which belongs to Star Alliance and I earned my points for quite some time now. I felt left out by the upgrade and so I asked one of the staff why the Miles and More members had been left out and my queries were rudely brushed aside telling me that 'You only fly economy'. Some of the FA's on board were friendly enough apart from one female FA with a really bad attitude. When I asked for a pack of toothpaste and toothbrush she immediately told me off they haven't got any and why did I bother to asked because I was in the economy section and then she walked away. When I asked one of her colleagues I was immediately handed a pack. I thought that being a Miles and More membership had gone to waste.

Lufthansa customer review,7,Gianluca Ratti,1st May 2015,Flew SFO-FRA on the A380. 11hr 20min in Y. Boarding at SFO was a mess because of some bad handling of their staff regarding priority boarding of disabled people that were flying with us. On board IFE had a decent selection touchscreen not very responsive though. They served dinner and breakfast in the morning. Honestly both were quite good. Staff were smiling even during breakfast in which they surely looked tired but they kept a professional attitude. They gave us a pillow and a blanket (which were acceptable) and the headset (terrible sadly). During the flight water was distributed frequently and you could also serve yourself in the galley for some snacks or some juice and the staff was gald to help. The recline is not bad at all but the pitch is really lacking sadly. No mood lighting also (which would have been a nice touch). Capt spoke frequently to the cabin also because of some sustained turbulence we had that interrupted breakfast: he assured everything was alright but we were unlucky as some strong tail winds shook us for a good part of an hour on the Atlantic. After we landed it was a mad rush to the connection with Air Dolomiti to Verona: FRA is quite huge and we only had an hour or so. All in all a good experience: I find that atm what sets apart an airline with an another is their staff which I found really helpful kind and respectful. I would fly with them again.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,4,yes

Lufthansa customer review,9,Jezrel Sabaduquia,20th April 2015,MAD-FRA-JFK. Airport experience in FRA was absolutely the worst. However on board product and service is excellent. First leg on the A321 full bar service and tasty hot breakfast was served despite being a short 2-hour flight. Service was excellent and attentive. Second leg on the A380 and sat on a small section of Economy class on the upper deck. There was a dedicated flight attendant for the mini cabin and service felt very personalized and private. He was extremely attentive caring and friendly. Lunch was delicious and substantial and so was the pre- arrival snack. IFE had a good selection of movies TV shows and cool features like the tail camera and the screen was of decent quality and responsive. Seats were comfortable and reclined a lot although under seat storage was extremely limited due to the IFE box.

I needed to freshen up before landing there were no seatbelt signals up so I seized the opportunity to use the lavatory to freshen up. As soon as I finished and exited the lavatory there was a flight attendant waiting for me. I opened the door and this woman was standing in front of the restroom with what seemed like arms folded and a scowling face as though I'd done something wrong. No I wasn't in first class and yes my ""freshening up"" in the lavatory may have taken some time. But at the end of the day I paid for my flight and frankly it is no business of a flight attendant what passengers do in the restroom. She said not one word and basically stared me down as I walked back to my seat. Needless to say the customer service was lacking from the flight staff and I will never fly with Lufthansa again.",,,Economy Class,,,4.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,,3,no

Everything was as planned our seats did not get mixed up like they usually do on other airlines. Boarding was smooth as expected. The flight was 100% full overheard the flight attendant saying that not a single seat was empty didn't also find an empty seat when I looked around. The flight attendants were very friendly and attentive overall the flight was very pleasant. Next flight was MUC-DEL onboard an A346 unfortunately it was a plane with the old IFE and seats but the outstanding service by the friendly flight crew compensated for it. Food was great didn't expect that good food from LH. Legroom was enough for this flight we landed 20 minutes late in Delhi due to thunderstorms in the area. DEL-MUC operated by an A333 with the new cabin very clean plane. It had the new IFE which was very neat looking however I think they need to add more popular albums and more movies. The legroom wasn't great but it was enough for me I'm 177 cm tall. The flight attendants were extremely friendly on this flight as well in fact all of the LH flight attendants were friendly. I don't like to eat breakfast on my flights but the food wasn't bad flight landed exactly on-time in Munich. MUC-ARN once again operated by an A320 flight was on-time with friendly flight attendants again. They served a sandwich on this flight which was not bad. Overall I'm very satisfied with Lufthansa's service very nice flight attendants they also had very helpful ground crew at DEL. I would gladly fly long-haul with them again!,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,3,A Acosta,16th April 2015,"4/10/2015 FRA-LAX LH 456. Lufthansa from FRA to LAX on A380 economy class and won't repeat this mistake anytime in the future. Seat pitch is listed as 31"" but felt more like 28"". Width is listed as 17"" and that felt about right. Seat configuration is 3-4-3 which is pretty much standard. It was just too cramped again I believe the pitch that Lufthansa list is wrong as I've never felt so tight with a 31"" pitch and I've recently lost 25 pounds. All else was great. Food was above industry standard staff were polite and attentive after meal drinks were plentiful and included brandy wine and beer at no charge. Snacks were passed out during duration of flight. Flight entertainment was weak but having a place to charge my laptop was handy as well as WiFi although slow and charged at 17euro. Unfortunately I have a bad back and will have to take a different carrier next time out.",,,Economy Class,,,1.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,2,no
Lufthansa customer review,1,Cristoffer Cedergren,16th April 2015,I went from Frankfurt to Singapore in a A380. Lufthansa had changed my prepaid comfort seat to a standard seat because of an equipment change. Drinks and food came in the wrong order. No menus were distributed. Staff were not service minded and looked more interested in playing with their smartphones in the gallery. Movies could not be seen with English subtitles. Not the level I expect from Lufthansa.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,2,no
Lufthansa customer review,10,S Tegtmeier,12th April 2015,Short flights FRA-VIE LH1138 and VIE-FRA LH1137 in April. Excellent flight experience concerning all aspects. After security check in FRA Lufthansa offers coffee and hot drinks for free and also a wide selection of international and German newspapers. During the flight you get a tasty sandwich and full bar service. Seats are comfortable for short haul flights legroom is good. Captain kept us informed about flight route arrival time and weather at destination airports. Cabin crew was fantastic attentive smiling and charming. LH is highly recommended for European flights!,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,2,B Borg,12th April 2015,OSL-FRA-TXL-FRA-OSL. A couple of hours after I checked-in online the day before I was supposed to travel OSL-FRA- TXL Lufthansa sent me an sms to inform me that my Lufthansa OSL-FRA sector was cancelled due to Lufthansa pilots being up to one of their capricious strikes again. This Lufthansa cancellation caused me a lot of inconvenience. Furthermore it was all in vain trying to call Lufthansa's reservations in Norway and elsewhere in Europe - lines were too busy to get through. So despite my very busy schedule I went to Oslo's Gardermoen airport where SAS do the ticketing for Lufthansa. In a very short time SAS rebooked me on the SAS direct morning flight from Oslo to Berlin-Tegel therefore greatly reducing the inconveniences caused to me by Lufthansa and Lufthansa pilots on strike. I paid extra to fly on Lufthansa as I had to be in Berlin early but in hindsight SAS was cheaper more reliable and better than the competition on this occasion - paying a premium to fly Lufthansa resulted as a waste of money time and effort (given the pilots strike not just SAS but also Norwegian and Ryanair would have been better on this occasion). On the return sectors TXL-FRA-OSL the service was very good and significantly better than I what experienced lately on Lufthansa. However all in all this is was the second time in the space of just 3 months that the industrial disputes between Lufthansa and capricious Lufthansa pilots caused me inconveniences while travelling between Oslo and Berlin. This time the inconveniences were not acceptable to me and as a result similar future travel arrangements will be on other Star Alliance carriers but preferably not Lufthansa.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,,1,no
Lufthansa customer review,8,Hang Van Hiep,6th April 2015,HKG-MUC on LH 731 seat 10D. The new seat is rather small (~ 47 cm in width) but it is almost flat. The screen for entertainment is approx. 15 inch. Lots of films and musics as well as documentation to watch. Food was good there are less magazines to read than in the past. The new seat is somewhat smaller but you can sleep better since it is almost flat. Impressive.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,3,yes
Lufthansa customer review,1,Gordon Allan,4th April 2015,In March of 2015 I flew from Vancouver to Frankfurt. As a world traveler I have experienced my fair share of cramped seating but was particularly appalled with the quality of the seating on this flight given that it was an 8-hour flight. The seats bordered on being hard-back chairs with little decline and poor leg room and width. This coupled with a mediocre audio-visual system and totally bland inflight food service left little to like about the airline. Granted the staff were helpful and friendly but in the end I just hated this flight. Impressive.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,,1,no
Lufthansa customer review,10,Sviatlana Papova,28th March 2015,Travelled on March 18th from Minsk to Barcelona with a layover in Frankfurt. Both flights were perfect. Great thanks to all the crew members for excellent service and comfort. Yesterday on March 25th took the same flights back from BCN to MSQ! The first flight was rather nice but the plane from Frankfurt to Minsk experienced some technical problems and we had to fly back to Germany. But all the staff members both in the airport and on the plane acted very professionally. We got a new plane and landed safely in Minsk. Impressive.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,10,Ian Patrick,25th March 2015,I travelled from Kuwait to Frankfurt and back for one night on 17th/18th March. Both flights had the new Business Class seat which is excellent. On both flights the crew were attentive and smiling and the food was very good. Check in at Kuwait was fast and efficient as was the boarding (for an early departure). The flight was short at just over 5 hours 30 minutes but the crew was relaxed and not rushed offering drinks a nice snack and a choice of breakfast. Returning from Frankfurt was equally pleasurable from check in to arrival with only a small delay due to congestion at Frankfurt Airport. Another good flight to Kuwait with equally good crew and catering. Impressive.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,4,yes

Lufthansa customer review,7,M Peretti,23rd March 2015,LH 414 11/3/2015. I've been and still am a loyal flyer to LH for more than 10 years but now its network of connections (LH and Star Alliance in general) is getting less competitive and forcing me to evaluate alternatives: in the US I'm forced to fly with alternative airlines. In Italy where I live connections to AOI airport have been cut and now I'm frequently going SkyTeam. I'm not happy with this.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,3,yes
Lufthansa customer review,8,Crowther Alexander,20th March 2015,Flew from VCE to FRA and from FRA to DUB economy class ticket. The crew on both flights were extremely polite and kind. On the VCE to FRA flight we had to wait in the aircraft for around 45 minutes due to problems with snow in Frankfurt. Some people were worried that they would miss their connecting flights but the crew and flight attendants kept us informed about all delays and changes. I got my flight to Dublin on time and it also had a slight delay. I have flown with Lufthansa most of my life and I am very satisfied with the airline. The food however is like with all other European and American airliners if you fly on an economy class ticket.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,7,Richard Connett,20th March 2015,"LH903 - LHR/FRA - A320 - 27 Jan. The check-in service at LHR was exceptional and one of the best check-in experiences I have had. As I was a premium customer the agent gave me an exit row seat and kept the next seat to me vacant. The service changed for the worst in the departure lounge. First of all they announced boarding for business class and Star Alliance Gold customers. I skipped over to that line to board only to be hauled up by an abrupt and loud ground crew member to be told in front of everyone that ""we are only boarding business class and Gold Star Alliance customers"". I had pleasure in telling her I was a Star Alliance Gold Member (actually Elite with Air New Zealand) and I then boarded. In this day and age no one should ever presume that only people wearing Savile Row suits and Italian shoes are the Premium customers. The rest of the flight was typical LH clean plane efficient and professional cabin crew with pilots getting us there before time and baggage being unloaded within minutes.",,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,2,Milan Grohmann,20th March 2015,LH 402 Mar 8 2015 from Frankfurt to Newark. There was a standard that on Star Alliance flights the gold members got following standard benefits on board. a) Priority boarding b) personal invitation on board by the steward c) free seat next to passenger's one to provide more comfort (if possible). On this flight everything was wrong. Boarding was chaotic there was no priority boarding. No invitation. The flight was not overbooked but stewardess seated another person next to me so she reduced my flight comfort significantly. She could have seated that person easily somewhere else. It didn't happen for the first time. The service standard of Lufthansa has decreased a lot during last 9 months.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,,2,no
Lufthansa customer review,10,F Biewer,20th March 2015,I recently experienced a great and very comfortable Business Class flight with Lufthansa from Munich to Miami. Perfect service very professional helpful and friendly crew. The food was delicious and a nice variety of wines was served. Everything very clean comfortable seat that was converted into a full flat bed. So I could get some hours of sleep. Very clean plane and technically in perfect shape as far as I a business person could see. Great service so I can highly recommend Lufthansa.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,6,R Thut,20th March 2015,MUC-TLS-MUC on March 12 and return March 16. The flight was operated by Lufthansa's CITY LINE with an E195. I love this aircraft. The crew to Toulouse were very nice and happy to passengers opposite on the way back. Presented themselves a little arrogantly. The service was a sandwich and a drink service. Fine with me. However they served the exact same sandwich on the way back. I am happy that Swiss will fly as of May 1 2015 directly to TLS so I don't have to fly to MUC to change.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,,4,yes

Lufthansa customer review,5,V Ladhani,17th March 2015,HAM-FRA-RIX: I have travelled this sector a couple of times in past few months and service has always been consistent although at times crew can be sour. All the flights were operated on time on standard A321 without AVOD. I am 189 cms tall and find LH seats hard but I somehow fit in cost cutting can be clearly seen. At all flights informative announcement from cabin. Toilets on LH can inconsistent dirty on some segments. On both flights to RIX crew ran out of sandwiches so we had to take leftover croissants. The crew are doing an acceptable job but they need to work on their snack service. This segment is 2 hours and has enough time to serve a decent snack and please also consider vegetarians. Even though I pay for a premium airline I always have to buy a salad or sandwich from the airport to eat inside the aircraft just because sandwiches are either with chicken or eggs. No vegetarian option and one can't even book a meal for long EU flights.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,,3,yes
Lufthansa customer review,9,V Kini,17th March 2015,DXB-FRA BUD-FRA-DXB. Usually exclusively fly with Emirates but I'm glad I chose Lufthansa this time. Online check in worked like a charm and the bag drop counter was very fast. As the intercontinental flight was red-eye didn't get to properly check out the IFE but it looked very promising. Food was excellent very good taste indeed. Cabin crew were nothing exceptional but very good nonetheless. Seat on the A340-300 was quite comfortable and I got some good shut eye. Seats on the A320 BUD-FRA were a bit thin but can't complain as it's adequate for the short hop. All flights were perfectly on time and although we had a 1 hour connection in FRA on the return trip we had plenty of time. Overall very good first experience on Lufthansa!,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,7,T Eldem,17th March 2015,LH475 from YUL to MUC on Airbus 333. Used the priority check-in for Star Alliance Gold and was served by a very efficient duo of agents. They moved me forward in the cabin and put me in a seat which had a good chance of having the neighbouring seat empty. It also provided extra legroom as it was in a transition row. Aircraft was spotless and bright and the pullback from the gate was on time. Service by FA's was efficient professional and attentive. Two choices of main course was offered for dinner and the food quality was good for Economy. There were several drink rounds throughout the overnight flight and breakfast was served prior to landing. IFE was expansive and offered a great choice of recent movies and other entertainment. Bathrooms were spacious bright and kept clean. Seats were as comfortable as one can expect in Economy and provided reasonable legroom. Flight arrived on time and we were kept informed by the captain at just the right points in the flight. Another great experience with Lufthansa they seldom disappoint.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,7,J Egan,17th March 2015,LAX-MUC on an A340-600 (newly reconfigured with Premium Economy). Had the aisle bulkhead in the front of economy. LOTS of legroom though the IFE and tray are both in the armrest (fine by me). Seat was very comfortable and I slept well. Crew were excellent as was the food. Got to watch 2 recent Oscar winning films in the IFE. I love the A340's having the economy class toilets downstairs. Wish LH flew directly to New Zealand: they would have my money every time.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,3,yes
Lufthansa customer review,3,Sebastian Nossing,17th March 2015,I traveled from FRA to LAX on a brand new Lufthansa Boeing 747-8i. The plane itself was in great condition with a wide selection of entertainment programmes and friendly staff providing good service. But economy seating was absolutely not acceptable in terms of seat dimensions. I am a pretty average sized male (187cm 90kg) and my shoulder width was wider than the seat. Same goes for my seat neighbour which meant that we had to sit uncomfortably bent and twisted or get personal. The forward distance was so narrow that my face was only 5 inches from the back of the forward seat when it was moved fully backwards. I tried to avoid the whole thing by upgrading to Premium Economy but I learned that a regular Economy ticket was not eligible for an upgrade. Only Eco Flex tickets can be upgraded but they are so expensive that I would go straight to Business Class instead of buying one of them. Overall I am still wondering what all these bonus miles on my account are good for. Conclusion: When I have an alternative on a direct connection next time I will give the competitor a try. Lufthansa's problem aren't overpaid crews but a lack of respect to the needs of passengers.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,3,no
Lufthansa customer review,5,O Benyehuda,17th March 2015,Flew Business Class from Newark to Stockholm and return to JFK both via Frankfurt. Outbound on 747-800. Beautiful plane and has a high tech feel. New Business Class is nice but somewhat cramped - the seats are very narrow and there is really no storage space. The angled seats puts your feet uncomfortably close to your neighbors. Service on board was very professional and attentive. The meal out of Newark was surprisingly good with an excellent fillet mignon but ground service was lacking - boarding was delayed by almost an hour after it was announced for unclear reasons and the lounge was crowded with terrible internet. Connecting flight on A321 - just economy seats for business class price. Nice service but terrible product. Return was supposed to be on United from Frankfurt but flight delayed for 7 hrs due to mechanical so switched to LH400. Again impeccable service but meal as is standard for Lufthansa out of Frankfurt barely edible - tough lamb with weird vegetables. Desert so small one needs a microscope to see it. The breads served were the best part of the meal. The biggest problem is Lufthansa's angled business class seat. The most uncomfortable business class seat in the air. The IFE system had very limited choices. We circled JFK due to a bad snow storm and then waited for gate forever - total delay of 2.5 hrs. but the crew kept everyone informed and were very nice. Bottom line - highly professional service with sub par cabins.,,,Business Class,,,1.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,,3,no
Lufthansa customer review,9,Glenn Standish,9th March 2015,I flew from Frankfurt to Tokyo and back on am A340-300. Both flights were excellent with good efficient service and responsive in flight entertainment. The wifi (paid service) was excellent and really helped to pass the time during the long 11-12hr flights. One passenger had an eating disorder and for some reason there had a misunderstanding and Lufthansa didn't have a meal for them. I was very impressed how the chief purser went out of her way for the passenger offering him food from business class and at one stage even her own food! The outbound flight was delayed due to a technical malfunction just as we were taxiing to the runway. However was impressed with how Lufthansa handled this. The pilot kept us informed several times and we were only delayed by an additional hour. Overall I highly recommend Lufthansa!,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,4,K Fortwaengler,9th March 2015,As large person (6ft 4in) it is almost impossible to sit in one of the standard economy class seats! I learnt that with the cheaper tickets a seat reservation is no longer possible. So even if you check in online (24 hours prior to the flight) only middle seats are available - absolutely impossible for people like me! I had luck that one person didn't check in so one of the seats with additional leg space was available. The crew supported me in this (the woman at the check-in told me that the seat maybe would be available and I should ask at the gate as I've arrived at the gate they already were informed). So this time leg space was no issue but if you don't like close contact to your neighbors you will not stay in the seat for a long time! You can't sit erect you have to buckle. I've spend more than 50% of the time walking around and chatting with the very friendly crew. For me (not paying an extra charge) this seat was OK. But for my neighbor who paid extra it was annoying - he like me was more walking around than sitting in the insufficient seat!,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,3,no
Lufthansa customer review,6,Devottam Sengupta,4th March 2015,Business class on BCN-FRA-DEL. BCN-FRA flight was decent (same seats as economy nothing to write home about good breakfast warm service) but for some reason was parked halfway down the Rhine valley when it arrived in Frankfurt. Took over 40 minutes to make my connecting flight at literally the other end of the airport. For some reason Frankfurt airport staff thought it necessary for all buses to wait for all passengers to leave the aircraft before staring the long trek to the terminal instead of a bus starting off when full. FRA-DEL flight was on the A380 with the old style angled flat seats. Given that both of Lufthansa's supposedly downmarket brands (Swiss and Austrian) have better long haul business seats Lufthansa has no excuse for continuing with this substandard product. To add to the cost-cutting feel the portions of food served on the flight seemed smaller than those I've gotten in the past on LH. At least the IFE worked fine and has good choice and the staff tried hard to keep the passengers happy. Would recommend flying Lufthansa business only if flying on an aircraft with the new business class.,,,Business Class,,,2.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,3,yes

Lufthansa customer review,8,S Buchholz,4th March 2015,Had a 10hrs flight from LAX-FRA with this airline and the service at the airport was okay. I did online-check in 24hrs before so I only had to go to the bag drop counter. The line was very long so I had to wait a long time. The funny thing was that the check-in line was much faster. Boarding was fast. The impression I got of the crew was that they were very unfriendly and were very stressed. The seats were comfortable for a long flight. Leg space was okay if the front seat isn't reclined. A plus was the inflight entertainment a large selection of movies music TV shows and games. The food was better than average a choice between two dishes. I had the chicken which was okay for an onboard meal. Breakfast was an omelette with spinach and hash browns a plus is that you have a good choice of beverages and alcoholic drinks. All in all it was a nice flight with average food and stressed stewards. In the past service was much better.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,7,O Hazan,4th March 2015,"IAD-IST (via FRA) in economy on February 21 2015. I arrived at IAD during a bad snowstorm. The gate counter showed the flight as ""on time"" until the 748 showed up 60m before the scheduled departure time. Departure was then delayed by 90 minutes. The American agents at the gate weren't very polished about it but not too bad either. They were able to give me my new arrival time in Istanbul (3.5h later than originally planned). We boarded but needed to de-ice and it took 2.5h between boarding and taking off. I am glad I had had a snack at IAD! The captain was frustrated and very apologetic throughout. This was my 2nd flight on LH 748 and although I love the Queen of the Skies the 748 economy cabin is not pleasant. It is very chopped up and you don't have that Wow feel you should have in a 747. I was on the first aisle seat behind the premium economy which means that the aisle abruptly narrowed and I was ""in the way."" Dinner was fine and the choice of entertainment was great. Because of the delay I had a rushed transfer at FRA where the passengers needed to take a bus to board (no jetway for the IST flight). The flight to IST on a spotless A320 was uneventful. Good lunch but no entertainment at all. All in all Lufthansa did well considering the storm.

Lufthansa customer review,9,Arthur Mosher,4th March 2015,"I choose Lufthansa over other transatlantic carriers because I have and continue to experience excellent service even in the economy class. I do wish however that Lufthansa had not followed the lead of United in the reduction of space in regular economy class and the introduction of a ""premium"" economy class for an excessive amount of additional fare. The space in the ""regular"" economy class has become too tight. Service continues to be good although the ""snack"" before landing in Chicago left much to be desired. The flight attendants on this particular flight (LH 430 on February 25) provided excellent service in a friendly and accommodating way. The interface between the Lufthansa and connecting United flight was better than I have experienced in the past although I believe that United continues to be the weak link in the Star Alliance particularly with regard to US-domestic flights that connect with Lufthansa international flights.

The cabin staff did not even bother to close the curtain separating business from economy throughout the entire flight that tells you everything you need to know about Lufthansa's incredibly poor short haul domestic product. I had transferred from a long haul flight where I experienced the new business product which is excellent. I guess the business cabin on short European flights is used mainly by connecting long haul business class passengers - surely nobody would actually pay to fly business on only a short haul flight at least not on LH group carriers.,,,Business Class,,,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,,2,no

Airplane looked new the cabin was in good condition and clean (the bathroom less so at least after a few hours into the flights). Beverages were served several times selection and quality were good. Food was o.k. but nothing to rave about except for the very tasty passion fruit cream for dessert on the flight back and the chocolate in between. I am glad though that again there was a vegetarian option. Service was quite friendly and attentive. For a tall person though the space in Lufthansa's Economy Class is really sub-standard: narrow seats leg room barely alright if the person in front of you has the seat in an upright position but very uncomfortable if that is not the case. My seat neighbor who had a center seat could hardly get out of the row. The space on Avianca's A318 for a domestic flight before that was definitely more generous and did not feel as claustrophobic. The IFE touch- screen did hardly react on both flights. Changing the program was therefore difficult.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,9,Erksson Jens,24th February 2015,LH 457 LAX-FRA 9th February. It was my first trip with a 747-8 and it was a great experience. I had a real good seat - 27K where I could feel comfortable and very good space to be an economy seat. Lufthansa always offers me a good service.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,8,R Ingo,18th February 2015,Trip FRA-SIN and BKK-FRA on A380/A340 respectively. Friendly crew good service. IFE has improved too. New seats in economy are OK but seem of poor quality as the recline function was already faulty after not a very long-time in service. I always notice that the crew 'vanish' after their routine service.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,9,Ford Alexander,18th February 2015,We flew FRA-SIN-FRA in business class. They have really improved their service offering. Now you get slippers and socks which does make perfect sense when you want to go to the restroom. They serve champagne in champagne glasses and finally serve espresso too. The crew to SIN was very friendly and courteous and took great care of us. On the return it was a little less overwhelming less smiles. IFE in general great more quality than quantity I prefer that. On return flight our screens didn't work and they didn't do much about it apart from suggesting we should sleep. Middle eastern Airlines really made a point and now all the others must follow if they want to stay in business. Advantage goes to LH their crews interact with customers .It's all a bit bland but what you see is what you get.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,9,D Keipinger,12th February 2015,Flight: LH430 FRA-ORD. Excellent crew good IFE very good food. Economy Seat could be improved.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,10,Di Mugno Michael,12th February 2015,Washington Dulles to Frankfurt. 19/1/2015. My first time in Premium Economy and it's been fantastic! Its not as cheap as Economy Plus on United but you can't compare that! Far more leg space fantastic seats where you can nearly lay down as in Business Class food and drinks served with style and great taste! For my next trip I will book Premium Economy for sure. It's 100% worth it!,,,Premium Economy,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,9,Krumm Christian,12th February 2015,"LH475 Montreal - Munich. Almost fully booked. Seats (Economy) quite comfortable but a little more space would be great.

Lufthansa customer review,10,Grund Thomas,12th February 2015,LH434 Munich to Chicago 26th January.

Lufthansa customer review,1,Decker Alexander,6th February 2015,LH460 22/1/15. We booked Lufthansa for our flight from Munich to Miami a 11.5h flight. We wanted to avoid an awkward flight with no space therefore we chose LH and paid more compared to other airlines. They say: there is no better way to fly. Honestly this was the poorest flight over the Atlantic. Absolutely no space to sit a domestic flight usually offers more space. The touchscreens almost were not controllable. You could touch them but they did not react so we could not really enjoy the inflight entertainment. The stewardess tried to help she was nice rebooted the system several times but it did not really work as it was to supposed to. Will never do it again.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,,2,no
Lufthansa customer review,6,L Richter,6th February 2015,The crew on the reviewed flight to the USA was great - very attentive and always friendly which isn't self-evident with regard to Lufthansa. The food was ok but the portion was too small for such a long flight (~11.5 hrs). The seat is very uncomfortable (hard and small cushion) my back and posterior already hurt after sitting there for 2 hours. Nevertheless it was better than a regular seat in Economy Class since I had at least a bit of legroom because I paid extra for an Emergency Exit Seat. I think it is very inappropriate to charge that much money for an Emergency Exit Seat. Overall experience was ok but not great.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,,3,yes
Lufthansa customer review,8,Benussi Patrizio,30th January 2015,LH 435 on 24th January 2015. Flight was very nice and punctual! Service very good! Business Class Lounge (of United) in Chicago is rubbish! Not really worth going there! No Flair no real comfort - just very cold and without any expression! Biggest disappointment on this trip! Otherwise the flight was good!,,,Business Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,9,Puneck Holger,28th January 2015,LH 797 Hong Kong-Frankfurt Jan 18 on B747-8. Really impressed by the new LH Premium Economy which I could use for the very first time. Check-in friendly and quick. Boarding efficient. On board a very friendly crew. Once I had taken my seat welcome drink was offered to all passengers in this section. Nice amenity kit at every seat. The seat is simply great much more space than in normal Economy big IFE-screen with huge entertainment options. This was one of the drawbacks of flying Lufthansa but they finally improved it. Meal service from a menu 3 main dishes to chose from. Well presented on fine china. Due to departure at midnight service very efficient but never looked stressed. Wanted to give us more time to sleep. The seat is very comfortable good enough to sleep for 6 hours or so. Of course can't compare with their new Business seats which are top notch. During the night staff came around with drinks and snacks. Breakfast could have been better in my opinion. But that's the only negative point. In all Lufthansa is getting a real premium carrier. Staff excellent efficient friendly and professional.,,,Premium Economy,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,9,R Friess,28th January 2015,LH 428 flight to Charlotte/USA was the introduction of new Premium Economy at this connection. Had a chance experiencing this new offer and was satisfied. Seat very spacious in economy and service upgraded compared to standard economy. A good option for the money having more room better service and comfort.,,,Premium Economy,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,10,Michael Esser,23rd January 2015,LH 457 1/15/15. My first time in Premium Economy. I will never fly business again. The leg space was great the seat did not incline like in business but still enough to enable me to sleep. The service was ok+ of course not like in business but still very good food and drinks were more than sufficient. I also have to mention the excellent service at the gate. I had been on the waiting list for an upgrade to business which had gone lost though. In premium economy there were only middle seats left which I didn't like. The attendant behind the desk looked into it and found a window seat for me. After some terrible experiences with other airlines (especially British Airways whose economy class has become a joke ever since they decided to divide their aircraft into five (!) different classes) this was an enjoyable experience.,,,Premium Economy,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,2,J Tydeman,23rd January 2015,Flew to and from Sao Paulo via Frankfurt. Already written about the disastrous seat reservation system so I won't rant on about this here again. I would say though that it took no fewer than 4 people at Frankfurt to actually resolve our seating issues. In the end only the Flight Manager was able/willing/empowered to deal with it. The crew on all flights were to be fair very good and the food was fine too. Seats however were very uncomfortable on the B747 so I got little if any sleep on the long 11 hour flights. Also the IFE is terrible. I have a very varied and eclectic taste in TV music and film and found little to entertain me. And to top it all off Lufthansa left our bags in Frankfurt en route back to London and can't seem to drag themselves to get them back to us in Southampton until tomorrow even though by their own admission they have now arrived on a later flight. Appalling.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,,2,no
Lufthansa customer review,8,Ursula Bonfiglioli,21st January 2015,LH 428. Flight and connections were very good. I would improve entertainment on board (old movies) and food could be better! Overall they are good!,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,9,Grimme Franco,21st January 2015,LH491 January 10 2015. I have been a senator member for many years and since 1998 I flew practically only with this airline to my complete satisfaction. In the years I also became an hon club member thanks to my very frequent flight trips. Now I am retired person I cannot afford to fly business and I regularly fly 3-4 times a year either to Brazil or USA to visit my son and daughter. I always book well in advance my flights (the last one of December 16 2014 was booked on June 6 2014). To be more comfortable (I have a knee problem) I always try to book emergency seats and this seems to be almost impossible. I would like to see the airline more sensible to this subject.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,3,B Niemeijer,21st January 2015,LH428 11/1/2015. Flight MUC to CLT with a small 330 / 300 Airbus. Flight was almost fully booked but plane was not parked at the gate but parked on the tarmac. Had to travel with busses. Plane was already delayed and extra de frosting made the delay even bigger. Entertainment system needed re booting several times. Crew were friendly. When you fly a lot like I do you expect a bit more variety of food - not always chicken with pasta.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,,2,no

Lufthansa customer review,6,T Persson,19th January 2015,"FRA-IAD with Lufthansa. I was upgraded to ""Premium Economy"" due to Senator status and a full plane so they bumped ""upwards"". It was a new 747-800 so the screens were OK and picture quality good. Positives: Better food than regular economy. Better legspace and seat pitch than regular economy. Negatives: Lousy headphones same as regular economy so could not hear the movie properly. Premium economy cabin was ""messy"". Strange sharing with regular economy in 4 rows before Premium and approx 8 rows behind in mid section. So premium was in the middle of regular economy so it did not feel special in any way it was just as flying regular economy but with better legroom. Service level was same as regular economy due to the location of the cabin. I don't think it is worth the extra cost (600 Euro more for round trip FRA-IAD) for so little extra comfort. If LH reaches Thai Airways premium levels then it is worth the extra money.",,,Premium Economy,,,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,,2,yes
Lufthansa customer review,5,K Watzinge,19th January 2015,LH460 12/16/2014. It was very cold in the cabin during the flight. The plane was very noisy. The seats were uncomfortable - the upper part of it pushed the head uncomfortably forward. The bun offered was dry and tasteless. The cabin crew were very nice and the inflight entertainment excellent!,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,,3,yes
Lufthansa customer review,9,W Michael,19th January 2015,Munich to Boston A330-300. New Business Class has finally arrived in most of the LH planes. In general I like the 180d-flat seat biggest drawback compared to other good business seats is the missing space for e.g. a laptop adjacent to the seat which superior seats from their other brands OS/LX offer you so you always have to use the foldaway table instead. Despite a fully booked C service was very efficient crew very attentive (and professional as always on LH). Entertainment screen is top of shelf. Plane was a little late and some people that had tight connection flights were fetched directly after arrival which is the efficiency LH is known for.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,9,Marcus Nyberg,19th January 2015,Stockholm - Munich - Lisbon return. Everything worked out perfectly on this trip. The planes were in good condition the service was excellent and the food was better than expected. The short stop in the clean and efficient Munich airport was a nice break.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,3,yes
Lufthansa customer review,6,Marcus Nyberg,19th January 2015,Stockholm - Frankfurt - Dallas. This time the Lufthansa experience was not as impeccable as I am used to. On the long flight during the day from Frankfurt to Dallas the IFE system never started up. This made the journey feel a bit longer than the 10 hours it actually took. Apart from that the service the food and the comfort was very good. Without asking for it I was also offered a very generous amount of frequent flyer points as compensation a few weeks afterwards.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,,2,yes
Lufthansa customer review,10,D Christian,19th January 2015,FRA-SFO: First Class Terminal in Frankfurt is very elegant. Onboard service very good. Professional crew. Quality of food and drinks very high. The minus was the arrival at SFO: No separate lane for immigration. The bags from all passengers (it was an A380) came on one belt - totally chaotic.,,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,9,F Livi,19th January 2015,LAX-FRA LH457 7 Jan 2014 (LAX) and 8 Jan 2014 (FRA). I choose Lufthansa pretty often since I like their competence services flexibility regarding the luggage and their on-time flights. The aircraft's I have flown with were mostly in good to excellent conditions. There is often a good communication from the captain about the flight conditions and so on. Friendly and efficient staff. Sometimes fares could be a little expensive but it is easy to find interesting prices. I would definitely recommend this airline to everybody.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,10,Grassegger Hannes,19th January 2015,LH 418 1/9/2015. Great service a beautiful new plane competent and friendly staff - had a wonderful experience going from FRA to IAD in the business cabin of a 747-8 on Lufthansa!,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,7,F Bertoni,19th January 2015,Sao Paulo-Frankfurt in Premium Economy operated with a packed 748. Flight left late but made it perfectly on time. I always fly this route with Turkish Airlines in Comfort class (Premium Economy) but this time I decided to give Lufthansa and its new product a try. Seat: absolutely adequate and wide enough. There is plenty of room for your legs. It is ok for getting some sleep. I liked the amenity kit distributed. What I really did not like it's the absolute absence of privacy as the Premium Economy seats are actually not separated in any way from regular Economy class. Very good (and upgraded) IFE. The welcome drink despite very basic (juice) is a nice touch. Cabin crew as always with Lufthansa is efficient similing and polite. But let me spend some words on the food: almost inedible. It is actually the same food you would get in Economy class but served in china plates. Portion are getting every time smaller and food is almost tasteless. The price paid was quite high - overall not the best value for money. I'm afraid Lufthansa lost me on this route as I will keep flying Turkish Airlines Comfort class. Generally speaking Lufthansa remains a reliable airline.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,,2,yes
Lufthansa customer review,8,M Schnaufer,14th January 2015,Vienna - Frankfurt - Buenos Aires (and back): Web check-in worked fine got my reserved seat in the rear of the B747-8. The feeding flight to Frankfurt was uneventful the small snack was okay I also like that you can have a beer on shorthaul flights. The walk to the departure gate was very long but that's not the fault of LH. Flight left Frankfurt on time but arrived late due to the very long flight time of 14 hours (resulting from bad weather over the Atlantic Ocean). Food was okay but less in quantity. I frankly do not understand why airlines cut costs by reducing the amount (and the quality) of food. At least you get alcoholic beverages. Entertainment is now great with a lot of movies/shows to select. I could also find some rest during this 14 hours flight. Unfortunately flight attendants did not make their rounds with beverages that often. Breakfast was very poor! Lufthansa is a reliable and professional airline they usually get you to your destination on time. But I am not really thrilled flying them.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,7,Ralf Bostedt,14th January 2015,Basically uneventful flight. Relaxed and stress free boarding. Perfectly on time (both departure and arrival). However cabin staff (on my side of the aisle) was in training. (Hopefully). Forgot things full command of English or German deficient. Couldn't answer question on what the food is. All acceptable however not the lack of friendliness. That is unusual at in my experiences as frequent travelers with Lufthansa. (Senator/Gold status).,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,2,A Klick,14th January 2015,I have never felt more like cattle than on our trip FRA-HOUSTON on 1/6. Very crowded cabins with seats too close on the Airbus 380-800. Seats cannot be reserved ahead tried every way possible spent ages on it. Check-in online with actual access to seat map that allows you to chose your seat would make a lot of frequent flyers of all categories much happier. Flight attendants are overwhelmed with issues because of the random automatic system booking. Families are scattered all over the plane. Even after take off there were still people trying to reunite. This mess causes people to try frantically to reserve seats from 3 days before until past the door closures why in the world does Lufthansa want to have their personal overwhelmed with this problem is a mystery they lost my trust.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,2,no
Lufthansa customer review,3,W Staab,14th January 2015,JFK-Frankfurt-Budapest then Vienna-Munich-JFK. Tried to book seats online after booking flight but now Lufthansa only allows seats to be booked online by paying a fee (amount depending on the seat chosen) until 23 hours prior to the flight time when online booking of remaining seats is free. First aggravation. Start was delayed 2.5-3 hours due to late arrival of aircraft at JFK- no weather problems all other European flights left on time only this Lufthansa flight was late. The plane was a 747-8 not full had 3 seats for myself. Food not of high quality but the service throughout was exemplary - superb. Arriving in Frankfurt of course missing connecting flight to Budapest with a 4.5 wait for next flight. Asked Lufthansa in Frankfurt if I could have use of a lounge during the long wait and was outright denied that privilege though they gave me a 10 Euro certificate for something to eat in the meantime but as we had passed customs there were no restaurants available in that area only snack bars so had a torte. Flight to Budapest was routine sandwich and drinks. Luggage arrived timely in Budapest. Return to JFK with short flight Vienna to Munich (drinks but no snacks) - then Airbus 330 Munich to JFK which was quite cramped as to seating even on the aisle. Food barely passed muster (metal cutlery though) as Lufthansa has declined dramatically in their culinary department but again the Flight attendants were magnificent many drink runs and staff courtesy and organization superior to both Swissair and Austrian flown on similar routes in the last months (Austrian has the best food of the 3 airlines but being owned now by Lufthansa that too has declined considerably from a few years ago). The new 747-8 had a quieter flight than most other planes flying transatlantically. Without the inability to book seats earlier than 23 hours before each flight and the very late departure of the flight to Frankfurt from JFK I would rank Lufthansa higher than a 3 - probably an 8 despite uninteresting bland meals.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,,3,yes
Lufthansa customer review,9,A Althani,14th January 2015,This was my return flight from Paris CDG to DOH via FRA in Business Class the flight from CDG to FRA was on an Airbus A321 was comfortable with prompt efficient service all on time though I was troubled that at check in although I explained to the staff that I had fragile glass ornaments but they refused to put a handle with care stickers on my bags. The portion from Frankfurt to Doha was on an Airbus A330 with the new business class which was very nice and excellent service with wonderful meal selection I really liked the Bavarian Goose. Though the connection time was very short just one hour but all our bags made it through which was also very nice.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,9,N Rieskamp,14th January 2015,Trip from Frankfurt to Dublin in Business Class on A319 (no connecting flight). You get what you expect. The weak point is the seating of NEK as its an Economy Class Seat with the middle-Seat blocked. Seat pitch and space are not luxury the recline is ridiculous and it feels somewhat cheap. There is no IFE and no power socket what was not so important on this 110 minutes flight. Nevertheless I would spend the money again as the rest was really ok.,,,Business Class,,,1.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,9,Hoang Van Hiep,11th January 2015,LH772 FRA-BKK with A340-300 window seat 23 K. Everything worked as expected. The flight was on time both for departure and landing. Check-in security boarding as well as disembarkation and baggage retrieval worked without a hitch. On-board service was competent and caring. No complaints at all for Economy Class you can't do much better than that. LH seats seems to be bigger than in the past a little bit harder but more spacious in length. The inflight entertainment is excellent with touch screen 8' monitor quite good quality. The only complain is that it shows the program of December 2014 even we started the trip on the first 2015. The steward promised to check and answer but he never returned.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3,yes
Lufthansa customer review,10,Hoang Van Hiep,11th January 2015,LH779 SIN-FRA with A380 window seat 23 K. Everything worked as expected. The flight was on time both for departure and landing. Check-in security boarding as well as disembarkation and baggage retrieval worked without a hitch. On-board service was competent and caring. The C class seat near the window got extra storage on the side and is very convenience. The only problem is the remote control under your arm rest some times you unintentionally hit the remote control and your film stops. I like the A380 very much.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,9,M Riccardo,11th January 2015,I flew Venice-Frankfurt-Delhi on December 28. Initial flight was supposed to be a day earlier so I missed my connection in FRA and was put on a Lufthansa flight to Delhi rather than Air India which was nice. VCE-FRA was delayed by 2hours and I only managed to make it because FRA-DEL was also delayed. FRA airport although I was there for less than an hour was an atrocious experience. I had to speed like crazy to make the flight and still had to go through security one more time and they were extremely rude unprofessional and in no way understanding. This is surely not Lufthansa's fault but it did ruin my trip. Flight to Delhi was on their A380 which I adore. Leg room was fair food was decent although they only had vegetarian options. FAs were extremely polite and professional and always asked if we wanted any drinks throughout the flight. My issue was mostly related to IFE which was not what I expected from LH. Overly German focused and pretty dull overall. Regardless I surely would fly them again.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,4,C Teed,11th January 2015,I flew on the new 747-8 that Lufthansa put into service from LAX to Frankfurt. The cabin was clean and the entertainment system functioned flawlessly. I was seated in coach somewhat in the middle section. The service was prompt and pleasant. Although I don't eat airline food the cabin crew completed service and quickly quietly cleaned it up. The aircraft itself was quiet and the lighting system was much more pleasant (L.E.D.) than the standard type. Overall better than many other transatlantic flights I've made.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,,3,yes
Lufthansa customer review,1,J Tydeman,5th January 2015,Tried to book seats online for our impending journey to Brazil. Spent an age going through all the information and was poised to spend a small fortune on allocated seats and then found I started getting spurious (but in no way informative) error messages referring me to a (German) telephone number. I decided after several attempts to use the Lufthansa webchat and a nice but not very helpful woman took me all the way through the very laborious process only to inform me after all that their website is not compatible with Google Chrome. So my Sister tried it for me on her PC and it failed yet again. Half the population uses Google Chrome! Lufthansa you really need yo try harder than this. Appalling start to our first ever Lufthansa experience. I am rating the airline on the various categories listed here as it won't let me submit a review without doing so.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3,no
Lufthansa customer review,8,Igor Popovic,5th January 2015,FRA-DTW and DTW-FRA LH 442 and LH 443. Food: It would be great to have the availability of both food choices when sitting at the back of the plane. I'm sure the person sitting in the first rows of economy class didn't pay more than the person in the back and should have the availability to choose between foods. Seat Comfort: The seatmap shown during the self check-in was not the same as found on the plane. In the seatmap during check-in it was shown that there was no other seat to my right. I ended up sitting in the middle seat.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,5,yes

Lufthansa customer review,10,Fink Erich,31st December 2014,Flight LH444 from FRA to ATL booked in ECO because our company travel policy does not allow Business but operational upgrade to C (based on my status as LH-Senastor) because the main cabine was full and C not even 50 % occupied. Plane was equipped with the new business class seats I like them very much. The food was excellent and the wine selection very nice. All in all I had a very relaxed flight and arrived in Atlanta right on time.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,4,J Harston,31st December 2014,Lufthansa is getting tired and it shows. I have flown 73 times with Lufthansa in the last 7 years. My flights BEG - FRA - ADDIS (via Jeddah) and return business class were very disappointing. Frankfurt - Addis is a long flight. Old aircraft old tilting seats old films old system unimaginative food no difference on the way back. Crew change in Jeddah swapped one good cheery crew for another.,,,Business Class,,,2.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,,3,yes
Lufthansa customer review,8,M Tushishvili,31st December 2014,I had the flight Paris-Tirana-Paris via Munich last month. Lufthansa offers very good European product. Both flights arrived on time and Lufthansa provides nice clean aircraft's with very friendly cabin crew. I am very much pleased with the generous leg room in comparison with low cost companies. This is very much appreciated! In terms of the food I have only one comment since Lufthansa gives sandwiches which used to be very tasty. Now they gave us the cheese sandwich which was full of unidentified cream and mayonnaise. It was so stodgy and unpleasant. I hope that the management will make appropriate actions to distribute healthy simple food in the future. Overall Lufthansa is my first choice and it is recommended without hesitation for European routes.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,2,M Gal,31st December 2014,I felt disappointed on my flight back from Toronto to Frankfurt in August. At the check-in counter I paid an extra fee since my bag was heavier but that was no problem. I asked if I could bring another hand-baggage but the answer was no. I felt ripped off when boarding I saw people with 3-4 bags each one when allowed is 1. And moreover I couldn't put my bag over me but 5-10 meters behind me since there was no place where it was supposed to be because a young couple had 2 backpacks 2 bags and 2 sleeping bags. I spent 1000$ dollars and 150$ more for the fee and I had my worst flight because I was so pissed off. And at the airport I had to take the money at the atm paying commissions because the credit card machine didn't work.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,,1,no
Lufthansa customer review,7,Tarun Gulati,31st December 2014,I like Lufthansa but increasingly flying through Frankfurt is becoming a nightmare. More often than not the plane is parked on the tarmac vs. at a gate and there are inordinate delays as the busses don't leave till they are absolutely full - if you are travelling first or business and have got off first or had priority boarding - it really makes no difference as you end up waiting in the bus. Also the amount of time that it takes to transfer gates during transit and also go through immigration make it easily one of the worse international hubs now.,,,First Class,,,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,7,G Spiros,31st December 2014,ARN-MUC 17 Dec one-way. Full flight on a A320. Service was a bit rushed. Everything was commenced in the first 20 minutes and then nothing only if you ask for it. A small sandwich was served and drinks. Crew were friendly and nice.

Lufthansa customer review,10,Simon Aleksander,31st December 2014,Flight LH475 from Montreal to Munich on 12/12/2014. A bit delayed due to late arrival of the aircraft from Munich however the delay was almost made up in Munich what allowed me to catch the connecting flight. Appreciate the upgrade to Business Class as Gold Star Alliance member - service great as usual no any problems. Recommend LH for long haul flights - even in the Economy Class the seat is quite comfortable and passenger safety and satisfaction is always of top priority.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes

Lufthansa customer review,4,John Vollbrecht,31st December 2014,December 2 2014 from Dulles flight 419. Destination was Frankfurt Germany. Upgraded on the return flight which was Frankfurt to Dulles on Lufthansa 418 on December 13 2014. Lufthansa has always been our preferred carrier but the new seating in economy was on the verge of intolerable. The way the seat attaches to the floor greatly limits what you can carry on there is no foot room. Knee room to the next row is minimal especially if the person in the seat in front leans back. The seats are narrow and not comfortable. They are squeezed together so much that the seat pocket in front of you can barely hold one bottle of water. Food has greatly degraded over the past few years. I feel degraded by being in economy class. It is insulting to pay for such a horribly uncomfortable trip. I felt like baggage being crammed into the baggage hold and that I had no value as a customer. Our return flight was much better as we unhappily upgraded to economy plus but we greatly resented being forced to pay more money just to have a seat that was adequate for an overseas flight.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,,3,no
Lufthansa customer review,10,Tercon Bojan,22nd December 2014,I adore Lufthansa's short-haul business class product. On this short 90 min flight from Munich to Amsterdam onboard an Embraer E90 the service was friendly yet professional the seat very comfortable and the food superb! The presentation is sophisticated and the quality excellent.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,10,Bassoli Denisley,22nd December 2014,Flight LH 490 from Frankfurt to Seattle Dec/5th/2014. The First Class lounge was a very good a first class service in full - reception attendants and attention breakfast food seating space for working Wi-Fi. Passport control was taken care and being driven to the gate was a nice touch. Inflight very relaxing courteous attendants continued and food were really first class quality and quantity wise. Flight entertainment could be slight better real bed was excellent working room as well. Maybe bigger pillows would complement. All in all excellent first class.,,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,8,Ayman Ilham,22nd December 2014,Had 2 flights MAN-MUC-RUH on 13th December 2014. First flight was LH-2501 from Manchester to Munich in an Airbus A321. No entertainment screens but this was only a two hour flight so I didn't mind. However the staff service was excellent and I got served a decent sandwich plus coffee and coke. Seats were okay for the short flight. Transferred at Munich Airport which was very neat and clean with a good bus ride from the plane to the terminal. The next flight LH-608 from Munich to Riyadh in an Airbus A330 (five hours) was the real deal! Seats weren't exactly the most comfortable out of all planes I've been on but it was good enough! Entertainment screens were quite unresponsive and not much of my interest but I have my iPod so I didn't mind. Managed to watch 2 episodes of Big Bang Theory and my sister watched Harry Potter (she was really happy that there were 5 Harry Potter movies available on the flight). Again excellent staff service (they smiled a lot for an added bonus) and I was surprised to get a really tasty meal (with Halal meat). Really well done for a non-middle-eastern airline! I felt completely relaxed throughout the flight!,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,9,Z Culig,22nd December 2014,LH 997 AMS-FRA service was much better compared to other European airlines on a short flight. Snack was served and drinks offered two times.

Lufthansa customer review,8,Michael Thumm,22nd December 2014,LH431. Whenever I fly between Germany and the US I try to fly Lufthansa. Even if one feels that Lufthansa cuts cost it is still better than flying one of the American airlines who typically use old airplanes don't even offer wine or beer any longer and have terrible food. Lufthansa finally uses upgraded planes between Chicago and Frankfurt which they didn't for quite a while (no idea why). However the seat comfort (no lumbar support at all) and especially the space between Economy class seats definitely declined or respectively shrunk within the last 7 years. It's a pain to get into these Economy class seats if one is just little bit taller not to mention having a careless passenger upfront of you who rams his seat into your knees without hesitation. The service at Lufthansa is always excellent and I always enjoyed that! Also the food is good and they still offer wine and beer.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,5,F Heinemann,22nd December 2014,One of the tightest seat pitches I've seen on a long-haul flight (Premium Economy not offered on this route). Cabin constantly too cold. Crew was relaxed and friendly at the beginning but less so at the end. Food a very mixed bag. No sleeping masks or any other give aways. Only upside: Entertainment system of the slightly better version without this clunky old-school remote control but a decent touch screen. On arrival we had a tarmac position (at Munich!) and had to take buses to get to the terminal something that feels odd on a long-haul flight.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,,3,no
Lufthansa customer review,9,A Althani,22nd December 2014,I flew from Doha to Paris connecting in Frankfurt the brand new product with the slightly angled flat bed seats was offered on this A330-300 on the Doha to Frankfurt sector but I was told that not all flights on this route have the new product the seats are comfortable in the sitting and reclining position but not long enough for me when it is turned into a bed. The foot rest was very narrow the IFE screen was big but the movie and TV selection was not too big. Food was good and the portions where generous I enjoyed the crepe for breakfast no amenity kit was offered. Flight attendants were professional when needed they were present but otherwise they did not bother you when watching a TV program or a movie as does happen on other airlines. The flight from Frankfurt to Paris was on time comfortable and all our bags came through.,,,Business Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,5,yes

Lufthansa customer review,7,S Toljan,22nd December 2014,I took a flight from Boston to Munich. As it is quite common with this airline the plane was in impeccable condition and practically new however the space - or lack thereof - in economy class is a bit extreme. I think the German engineers went overboard and squeezed a few too many rows into that bird. My inflight entertainment system worked fine but my wife's next to me didn't. The flight attendant told her 2 or 3 times that she would look into it and reboot the system but then she never did. Nothing major but a little more attention would have been nice.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,,3,yes
Lufthansa customer review,2,Jens Praet,22nd December 2014,Flight LH797 (Dec 11 2014) from Hong Kong to Frankfurt in economy class I don't have a frequent flyer status (yet) however I try to be loyal to one company. New Boeing 747-8 in economy - you get what you paid for I always say - but due to my unpleasant experience below some observations that should be taken into consideration. Seats are extremely uncomfortable and the given space on the 747-8 feels incredibly cramped - Lufthansa's smaller airplanes are controversially far more spacious - I get they want to squeeze in as many passengers on the plane but on a +12 hrs flight you don't want to feel like a sardine in a can! Hostesses not attentive in general. In the future I will rather fly with Lufthansa's sister company Swiss Airlines which I personally find of a much better service.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,,3,no

Lufthansa customer review,8,B Borg,18th December 2014,Oslo-Munich-Berlin / Berlin-Frankfurt-Oslo. Convenient schedules good and efficient service almost throughout. It was worth the premium over flying with another company.

Definitely looking forward to my next Lufthansa flights.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,8,R Jakab,18th December 2014,LH456. Had the opportunity to fly LH456 from Frankfurt to Los Angeles in Economy (normally I fly business). Was impressed by the overall high standard (the new B-747 I guess) and inflight entertainment is top of the tops. Small disappointment in food and beverage: Food: overall quality good chicken run out two rows before us so pasta only choice. In addition I do not understand why proper bread is not served instead of this white thing that resembles bad quality (Germany has good bread) Beverage: fail to understand why you get 2nd rate prosecco / sparkling and wines. Furthermore non-alcoholic beer was not available on flight. That is cost-saving on the wrong level in my opinion.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,2,U Salwender,10th December 2014,LAX/FRA/LAX. 1 of 11 Lufthansa flights in the last 18 months. Some of which were affected by their relentless strikes. I found it to be hit or miss depending on cabin crew. The planes are always clean but never comfortable. The food is always there but can be an insult to taste buds. My last flight was cancelled due to them having a pilot strike. Didn't get that message until a day after which by then was irrelevant. I went to a Lufthansa counter at Cologne airport to get help. Their helpline was hopelessly backed up. The flight crew on both legs of my trip seemed arrogant and unresponsive. I missed the beverage service as I was looking out the window - the flight attendant was one row forward by the time I noticed her and simply ignored my attempts to get her attention. They charge legacy rates for substandard service. I will more than likely shop for other airlines for future trips making sure it isn't a Lufthansa code share.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,,1,no
Lufthansa customer review,4,Hessing Frank,10th December 2014,LH 465 from Orlando to Frankfurt on Nov 9th 2014. Despite their marketing campaign on many Lufthansa flights to the US and elsewhere there are still the old business class seats installed. I was on the Orlando - Frankfurt flight. Those seats are not good. Hard not good for sleeping not 180 degree flat but an inclined S form. Other airlines offer a much better business class for less money and on my next US flight I will definitely choose another airline if I find out that the airplane has the old seats. Lufthansa tickets in business class are generally high priced. so I would expect 180 degree seats. Service staff though is very well trained professional and food quality is good.,,,Business Class,,,1.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,2,yes

GRU-MUC on A346 in Business good food good service seat not that comfortable this time - still some hours of rest. IFE some nice films but very limited selection.

Lufthansa customer review,8,Tercon Bojan,10th December 2014,The 747-800 is my favourite plane in the Lufthansa fleet for it has their new lie-flat business class seat which was much appreciated on this 13 hour flight from Buenos Aires to Frankfurt. However I was very angry that the IFE did not work in my seat. Despite three attempts to reset it. Kaput! Not exactly satisfying when you pay premium $$ for a seat on a long-haul flight. The onboard wifi was also broken. I do have to say though that the purser came to apologize to me and she did a great job in explaining the situation re all the technical difficulties. Was appreciated. The food presentation and choices were excellent despite the flight attendants' initial insistence on speaking German to me even when I repeatedly asked them a question in English. Liked flight info and map.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,,4,yes

There was no great selection of movies unless you know German. I wish I carried iPad. The FA's were rude not interested in customer service. For the 10 hour flight from Chennai to Frankfurt first 8 hours they serve nothing other then two rounds of juice. Just before landing a small light breakfast. Seats were cramped. I was disappointed with LH and will not fly again.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,3,no

So much so I had to put my weekend hand luggage under the seat in front. Crew where friendly and professional. Inbound less busy.

Lufthansa customer review,5,B Baldi,25th November 2014,Flight from San Francisco to Frankfurt on AB A380 aircraft clean food OK staff OK. Seat lousy - no legroom and uncomfortable. Armrest on aisle seat would not lower making it hard to leave the seat. Staff didn't know how to fix the problem. In-flight entertainment system next to useless because of unresponsive touch screen and one audio channel not working. Aircraft temperature cold to the point of requiring a jacket be worn at all times. On connecting flight to Berlin Luft. gate staff did not announce gate change in English so confusion resulted among waiting passengers who didn't speak German or missed the change on the electronic screen. Flight from Munich to San Francisco on AB A340 departed late because of baggage handling problem. Aircraft clean but temperature again cold and seat comfort worse than A380. In flight entertainment center barely working because of slow finicky touch screen and static in audio. Food OK not good just OK. Before taking Luft. again I will be sure to shop around for a better choice even if it means paying more.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,,3,no

As it arrived earlier than the scheduled time we were transported to the terminal by a bus. The second leg from Frankfurt to Zurich was delayed by 45 minutes due to an unknown reason. Again we were transported by a bus to the B737. Here is where the entire staff and crew showed their effectiveness. The flight duration was cut short to 40 min from the original 55 min.

My travel partner couldn't have his meal choice fulfilled on-board twice! FRA-BLR and on the return leg BLR-FRA. The seats on the new B-748 were comfortable however my personal reading light did not function and I could not get the wifi access. There was enough space and more than enough to eat on board.

Lufthansa customer review,8,Patel Niri,20th November 2014,Flew MAN-MUC-DEL return in Business Class. Lounge in MAN is ok - typical regional airport lounge. Warm croissants. Breakfast on flight was ok - had ordered Asian veg. Service good. The long haul was a pleasant surprise. I'm 6ft tall and managed to get zero sleep on a flight to Mumbai from Frankfurt 7 years ago and that was my last flight with LH. The new Business class was a pleasant surprise. Cabin crew were friendly and welcoming. Amenity kit is good. The seats are a huge improvement on the sloping beds. I managed to get a few hours sleep too. If you sit by the window you may find it a bit cramped. I switched to an aisle on the way back and this wasn't so cramped. Will use them again for Delhi especially s the flights tend to get in earlier than most other carriers. Lufthansa served 2 full meals on this flight which is impressive. Lufthansa need to realise that paneer (Indian Cheese) covered in Indian gravy for both meals wont escape the attention of the least sober passenger. As I wasn't interested in the food I forgive them. Will fly LH again for value and comfort.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,9,Andrew Noble,20th November 2014,I have to report an excellent journey JNB-FRA-LCY. New refurbished Business cabin on the A380 is very comfortable and a lovely decent sized pillow on which to sleep. Lie flat seat/bed is good but could be a bit narrow at shoulder level. However I managed 5-6 hrs sleep which is unusual for me on a lon flight. Food delicious especially on my outbound FRA-JNB sector Roast Goose which was perfect! Crew on all sectors were friendly and professional and the transit through FRA was a breeze. I would advise people to choose seats at rear of the 380 upper deck pref. row 26/27 as LH serve their food from the rear moving forward so you'll always have a full menu choice if seated here.

They don't serve water at the seat - when I asked for water I was told to go and serve myself in the galley. In Frankfurt my flight to Boston was displaying on the screens but no gate indicated for a long time. I approached a member of staff to ask and was told ""I am not the Information counter"".

The seat booking system is not working at all. Estimate 75% of cases the seat cancellation is performed without any background - it is very disappointing. Flight LH2023 is a classical example of another incomprehensible situation - nearly every day the ""business class"" (which in LH's case is nothing but economy divided by curtain from the rest of the plane) is extended till row 12 making 48 business seats while occupation is 3 - 5 ""business"" passengers. Remaining travellers are squeezed in the back while front section is entirely empty. Another trick is to extend the ""business class"" for 24 hours to row 19 remove all forward seats reservations and then return back to the original configuration. Why they do it is a mystery to me.

Lufthansa customer review,1,K Lam,12th November 2014,Oct 19 LH783 a group of us travelled to France in transit at Frankfurt Airport. Our confirmed seatings were all messed up despite we have booked this in Feb 14. It took us 40 minutes at KLIA Lufthansa counter to sort this out - each couple were seated together but the group had to split up. On our return leg (7 Nov 14) our group confirmed seats were again messed up despite reconfirming the seat 3 days before our departure with Lufthansa Malaysia. The check in counter staff was not helpful nor friendly at CDG airport to help us to reassign our seats so that each couple could sit together but the group was split up again. The return flight (Paris to Frankfurt LH1043) was re-timed later by 20 minutes but we were not informed and the flight arrived late at Frankfurt. So we had to run for our connecting flight to KL.

Cabin crew very responsive and friendly. Food satisfactory. Return was CPT-MUC-LHR. A340-600 from Cape Town - plane not crowded so good service again with satisfactory food and drinks. Attendants served beverages throughout the night. Seats were comfortable all round. Minimal fuss and no problems with delays - all flights on time. Very good long haul flight. Short hop from Munich to London was good as well with breakfast snack served just right for this length. IFE can have more up to date movies and music but small price to sacrifice.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,9,Parag Narkhede,11th November 2014,I traveled with my family on LH 768 from FRA to PNQ on 7th November 2014. It was a really good travel experience for us. Very comfortable and convenient too. Seats are comfortable same as any other regular Lufthansa flights. Landing at Pune for Puneites is far better than to Mumbai saving a lot of time in immigration process and travelling from Mumbai to Pune. Its really great to fly direct to Pune from Europe and credit to Lufthansa and PrivatAir.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,2,Kovacs Charles,6th November 2014,Impossibly thin seat and insufficient legroom and this was a long flight (Philadelphia to Frankfurt). Very poor food even by economy standards. Inflight entertainment system did not work well choice of classical music weighted towards modern composers. The only saving grace was the cabin crew. Lufthansa used to be a good airline but these days it's more like a discounter charging legacy prices. Avoid it if you can.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,,1,no
Lufthansa customer review,9,Jarolim Petr,6th November 2014,Very happy with our first class flights. The first class lounge in Munich was very pleasant with the usual high quality food offerings. The food onboard was good when traveling from Boston to Munich on 10/17 and outstanding on the way back - Munich to Boston on 10/26. Service also very good Boston-Munich and absolutely outstanding on the Munich-Boston flight. The flight attendant on the Munich-Boston flight was fast efficient and very pleasant. Entertainment was OK we both care more for recent movies than the latest releases but I understand it's difficult to please everyone. I'd say that the Wi-Fi should be free in first class. The Munich-Prague and Prague-Munich segments in business class were pretty much standard the Munich-Prague flight was quite delayed fortunately for us the Prague-Munich flight was on time. All in all a pleasant experience.,,,First Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,3,yes
Lufthansa customer review,2,Schaefer Michael,6th November 2014,Flight LH491 - really bad seats. TV box under the seat. No room for legs (I'm 185cm tall) TV selection was poor. Touch screen hardly worked. Sound was awful and flickering monitor.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,2,yes
Lufthansa customer review,6,Kristine Schaefer,3rd November 2014,IAD (Washington Dulles) to MUC (Munich Germany) LH 415 Oct 5 2014. Seat comfort: The aircraft was an A330-300. I had a window seat. Foot space was ridiculously small as two metal boxes of about 10 cm width each were fixed to the legs of the seat in front of me. Every window seat seemed to have that feature. This makes a long haul flight very uncomfortable. Inflight entertainment: The touch screen took ages to react or was so sensitive or insensitive that I never knew whether I had pressed it correctly or not. The rest was fine.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,,3,yes
Lufthansa customer review,2,K Roberts,3rd November 2014,Flight out of Krakow to Munich cancelled due to heavy fog. Lufthansa in Krakow put us up in hotel for night with vouchers for meals. Lufthansa staff at Krakow were great cannot say the same for the staff in Germany! Re-booked next day to Munich one hour layover then home to Chicago. Flight next afternoon was late due to incoming plane being late. Thus our one hour window to connect was becoming smaller. Announcements on plane about other connections but none regarding Chicago. I asked a flight attendant before we landed and she said she knew nothing. We arrived late in Munich So the 2 of us and 3 other passengers missed our connecting flight to Chicago by minutes! No one at gate in Munich to assist us. Finally directed to service center where we waited almost an hour to be re-booked. Re-booked to Frankfurt that night where we would be given hotel vouchers then on to Chicago the next day. When we boarded short flight to Frankfurt the pilot made an announcement that we would be delayed because we were waiting for 7 passengers who were connecting! In Munich we told rep we wanted to pick up our luggage in Frankfurt. Arriving in Frankfurt we had to go to Service center again to get our hotel and meal vouchers. He directed us to belt 16 Baggage claim B to get our luggage. We got there no luggage! Talked to lady at baggage tracing and she told us the bags arrived at A and since no one was there to claim them they were in a holding cell. She finally made a call and within 10 minutes our bags were there. Frankfurt airport is huge and Lufthansa agents were few and far between no one seemed to know anything. Classic case of the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing. The clincher is when we boarded our flight to Chicago the next day we were delayed because a family was detained in immigration! What happened to not being able to hold the plane? Horrible service. Unless Lufthansa is the only airline flying to where I am traveling I am not using them again. No one seemed to know and much less care.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,,4,no
Lufthansa customer review,9,Oehmichen Alexander,3rd November 2014,Travelling from Frankfurt to London-City. Fast boarding procedure and arriving on time. The sandwich on board was really tasty and a decent snack on this one hour flight. The friendly flight attendants completed this pleasant journey.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,6,U Fritsch,31st October 2014,Took flight LH 494 from Munich to Toronto on October 23 2014. Flight was 1 hour delayed departure as well as arrival. Plane was technically up-to-date. On-board personnel and service was satisfactory. All equipment worked without fail. Seats were reasonably comfortable and provided satisfactory space. Entertainment program provided wide range of choices. All-in-all good flight despite the delay.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,2,yes
Lufthansa customer review,8,D Ito,31st October 2014,MEX-FRA with B747-8 new business class seat. On time flight and friendly crews. New seat was comfortable however if you have a window seat you need to stride over an aisle seat passenger on the relax/sleeping position. Meals were quite simple no good nor bad. No impression and just snacks sandwiches were served between meal times. BOSE noise cancelling headphone worked quite good. New Entertainment system for 747-8 was excellent. USB port didn't work. AC power outlet worked.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,6,M Marchetti,31st October 2014,MUC-JFK flight LH410. Good on board service. Economy seats really to small for a continental 9 hours flight (central row one of the last in the rear of plane). If you want to choose your seat during booking or before check-in you will be charged an additional fee.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,2,no

Lufthansa customer review,8,Dimitrios Salampasis,31st October 2014,I am a Lufthansa frequent customer and I have always enjoyed their service and timetable. My flight experience from YUL to MUC left me with a bit of mixed feelings. Even though the flight is not that long approx. 7 hrs the plane was fully packed with people and the seats were really uncomfortable. It was not possible to move around and not even sleep. Furthermore the passenger in front of me considered her right to keep her seat not in the fully upright position during the entire flight leaving me with very limited space. And when I asked the flight attendants to tell her to bring her seat a bit further up so as to have some space myself I was taken by surprise to hear that they could not wake her up and that I should simply do the same or change seat (I seat that I had pre-selected and paid). Maybe Lufthansa needs to reconsider the number of passengers and luggage allowed for long- haul flights and not treat passengers as commodities to that respect.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,8,N Bojkova,28th October 2014,Flight LH495. I flew from Munich to Toronto. The flight was very relaxing with excellent service and food. I arrived to some extent relaxed despite of the long trip.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,9,W Coulton,28th October 2014,Short hop FRA-DUB on A321. Check in and cabin crew friendly. Decent snack served on this 2 hr flight. Departed on time and arrived early. The slimline seat provided extra legroom and was OK for this length flight but may be a bit hard if the sector is longer. Very happy to use again at least on European sectors.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,2,A Bland,22nd October 2014,Manchester-Chisinau via Munich. Initial outward flight delayed due to crew 'being stuck in traffic' although all passengers were waiting at the gate on time (it was a full flight). Standard of slimline seating on Lufthansa flights not comfortable at all (way too hard even for relatively short flights). Cabin crew pleasant and drinks / snacks ok. On return journey Lufthansa had another delayed flight back to Manchester with plenty of seats still available that would have got me home much earlier than my booked flight but their 'customer service' staff in Munich wouldn't entertain allowing me on it that would be far too helpful for them. All in all nothing special for the price far too inflexible / not focussed on customers and I'll avoid Lufthansa in future for that reason.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,,2,no
Lufthansa customer review,5,T Noone,22nd October 2014,I recently flew on Luthansa Flight LH414 (Munich to Washington D.C.). Plane was good but the service was marginal. Flight service was very rushed. One got the impression that they wanted to get everything done quickly so that they could sit in the back and talk which this is what they did. I sat in the last row of the plane.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,,3,yes
Lufthansa customer review,9,Lekon Niels,22nd October 2014,Flew with a A330 from Munich to NYC (JFK airport). It was a pleasant trip. Comfortable seats nice and very helpful flight attendants. Unlike e.g. British Airways which I have used for my last two trips to North America the catering on board was great. Additional water or juice e.g. was served regularly. The snack before landing consisted of Weißwurst Pralinen and a Laugenbrötchen which was very delicious. I asked for an extra portion which I got without any hesitation. They would have thrown away any leftover food anyway so I thought eating another portion would be better as it was extremely good. The only downside to the flight was that the aircraft engines are quite loud compared to other aircraft's. Also the choice of films could have been better. Overall I was very satisfied.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,9,Matthias Ullrich,22nd October 2014,LH494 MUC-YYZ. Airbus A330-300 (333) V1 (re-vamped interior with the new LH biz class seats) seated in eco emergency row 30 window seat pair. Status customer with LH (senator) travelling with partner. Ground service (baggage drop-off lounge etc.) seamless as always. Sky service attentive quick quiet very professional little kids of other passengers and elderly passengers all taken care of with help. Sky catering as good as you can expect in eco little treats added to the overall good level. New version of LH safety script at taxiing is much improved easy-to-understand delivered at the right slow pace w/o becoming dragging and boring. Also no bothering bold music during take-off/landing times as with some other *A carriers. Overall LH manifests that they are of course not the cheapest but they quietly excel in numerous details by those few percent compared to others. You just feel that little bit less worn after an LH eco long-haul as you might do after one with other carriers.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,10,Thomas Pornschlegel,22nd October 2014,Excellent lounge at IAD with pre-flight meals. Direct boarding of the aircraft from there. Unobtrusive friendly service. Excellent sleeping comfort in the first class cabin.,,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,2,T Mahr,20th October 2014,Just off LH2051 TXL-MUC. Probably ranks as one of the worst flights ever - no welcome onboard plane totally full however no help from crew in stowing luggage - busy chatting among themselves. Pilot eventually told us they would delay the flight if we did not manage to stow baggage ourselves. Rude and snotty service inflight with no smiles. Seats uncomfortable and too short. In addition to that all flight delayed as usual. LH is going downhill.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,2,no
Lufthansa customer review,9,J Braun,12th October 2014,FRA-JFK 747-8 in First Class. Truly First Class experience all the way from the exclusive feel of the FCT at Frankfurt limo to the plane and then a very warm and professional welcome from the fantastic crew. Cabin 7/8 full. Seats 1A and 1K are great for people traveling together although not the most private. Beautifully elegant cabin comfortable seat/bed and simply wonderful service. Only the food was disappointing - nothing special and poorly presented. Excellent wines. Bags first off at JFK and off the plane and through Customs within 20 minutes! Would definitely fly again.,,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,,3,yes
Lufthansa customer review,9,Uwe Günther,12th October 2014,FRA-LAX and return. New business class is very comfortable and Lufthansa crew is always friendly. Food was also good generous portions and very varied. Only downside on LH is the entertainment system. They could add more recent movies to their list.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,1,Andal Raghavan,12th October 2014,My wife flew on 10/6/2014 from Newark NJ on Flight LH 403 to Frankfurt and from Frankfurt to Chennai India on Lufthansa LH758. For health reasons my wife needs a wheelchair as she has trouble walking. We requested a wheelchair for her at the Newark Frankfurt and Chennai airports. Everything was fine in Newark NJ. However when she arrived at Frankfurt no wheelchair was provided. Lufthansa staff advised her there was no wheelchair and to walk slowly. When my wife told them she can hardly walk and carry the carry-on luggage they ignored her. Finally one Lufthansa staff walked her to the bus to the next flights terminal but she did not help in any way. Seeing my wife’s inability to move the carry-on another kind passenger helped her. When she arrived at her terminal she had to wait for the cart to drive her to her gate. Lufthansa staff needs to be trained in customer service especially service to individuals who need assistance. These flights are not inexpensive and there is no excuse for this type of rude and incompetent service.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,,3,no
Lufthansa customer review,2,John Comissiong,12th October 2014,3 of 4 flight segments this year have all been delayed. The last one being this morning from BCN-FRA over 30 minutes late. On the outbound FRA-BCN economy passengers were served half of a sandwich. That's how far LH has sunk now.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,3,no
Lufthansa customer review,9,Svensson Dan,12th October 2014,Excellent service and customer focus on the flight LH474 to Montreal. Quick and fast check in and boarding. Flight departure was delayed due to technical problem with luggage room with 1 hour but was partly caught up during the trip. Good and continuous information about the repair status by the flight officers.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,9,A Bergmann,12th October 2014,Flight LH 409 Newark to Dusseldorf in September. Flight was operated by an older A340-300 which was in very good condition and had nice inflight entertainment on big personal screens (much better than on Lufthansa's A330s at the moment). IFE featured loads of movies and fancy stuff such as real time speed / altitude. Flight departed about 1 hour late. Nevertheless I could easily catch my connection to Vienna. Food was alright could have been a little more though. Drinks were always available. Cabin crew did a great job very friendly and professional. Seat comfort was good for Economy Class enough legroom and I like the 2-4-2 seating. Changing in Dusseldorf was very convenient (small distances and a nice airport). I'm usually very satisfied with Lufthansa.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,8,A Palomo,12th October 2014,BHX to Munich via Frankfurt and Munich to Birmingham inbound. Could not fault the flights I had with them. Service was very good and cabin crew attentive. Travelled with two friends for the Oktoberfest who were both 6ft 6in and I am below 6 ft. Both of my tall friends had no complaints with the legroom. Baggage arrived on time. All in all flights had been hassle-free. Only downside is lack of entertainment but for a short flight it was barely noticeable. Will definitely fly with them again.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,4,Stephan Wismann,8th October 2014,Entertainment System and reading lamp didn't work and this is not the first time. I traveled 7 times this year between Canada and Germany with Lufthansa and 3 times the entertainment system at my seat was broken. Especially on such a long overseas flight it is unacceptable!,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,,3,no
Lufthansa customer review,4,Olle Olerup,8th October 2014,Lufthansa flight LH763 from Delhi to Munich October 4th 2014. Out-dated and worn business class seats. Possible to recline fully but narrow. Really close to non-existent service. Despite few passengers in business class very slow and inattentive service. After initial take-off beverages no more drink service of water or anything else. Food quality like in a cheap charter flight. No one of the staff bothered to serve a quick breakfast to those passengers who wanted to sleep a bit longer not even a cup of coffee.,,,Business Class,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,2,no
Lufthansa customer review,1,Edwin Eisenberg,8th October 2014,Flight 427 PHL to Frankfurt on August 23 2014. This flight was supposed to have new business class. The video was non-functional and my seat would not operate properly. We were in 4A and 4C. At the end of the flight the flight attendant found a large water bottle in the mechanism inside the seat cushion. Headphones were loose attached to the console and not in separated plastic bags. Drinks were horrible. The flight attendants were nice. The stewardess told us at the end of the flight that planes were switched in Frankfurt.Our flight from Frankfurt to Athens was on a 321 airbus. Business class was 3 thin coach seats with no one in the middle seat.,,,Business Class,,,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,,1,no
Lufthansa customer review,7,V Ladhani,5th October 2014,TXL-FRA-RIX: Both the legs were operated by A321. Crew were pleasant on both the flights especially that onwards to RIX. They were lively willing to help and didn't mind making small talk with passengers. Like all LH flights even this one was refitted with Recaro seats and ceiling attached TV. Passengers were served muesli bars on first leg and on the second leg yoghurt dip with freshly chopped fruits - this is what disappoints me as LH takes pride in being full service airline. Previously they at least served freshly baked bread rolls and sandwiches. LH should really reconsider on snacks they serve as I believe 120 mins are enough to serve a proper small meal although the crew is saving grace and made several drink rounds. I have travelled extensively on different airlines and wouldn't hesitate to suggest LH to up their game.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,,3,yes
Lufthansa customer review,3,Christian Streuber,1st October 2014,LH 464. The plane was changed between flight booking and the flight itself therefore all passengers (especially families) could not sit together as originally planned. Everything was mixed up. The way the flight attendants worked with this was not very helpful. Many children were on this flight. The flight back was much better. Nevertheless I would book Lufthansa again.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,,3,yes
Lufthansa customer review,9,Eelco van den Heuvel,1st October 2014,DUS-LHR-DUS. One of the last LH-routes out of Dusseldorf because LH has transferred almost all European and domestic flights to Germanwings. That's a pity because once again LH showed why it's a great airline. Friendly staff -ground and air - and a very punctual performance on both legs. Tasty sandwich two drinks and reasonable comfort on the A320. A little more expensive than the LCC's but it's worth it. LH stays my favourite airline. And once again Dusseldorf airport is a breeze.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,9,J Busse,1st October 2014,AC 9433 - LH476 on Tuesday Sep 23rd 2014. Innovative food. Good service. Generous inflight entertainment. Seat is as uncomfortable as everybody else's in economy.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,10,Lutz Reinhart,1st October 2014,LH 465 9/21/2014. Lufthansa provided excellent value a very pleasant flight experience and great professional staff from pilots to cabin crew! It is always a pleasure to fly with Lufthansa because their crew really values you and gives you the best flight experience possible. The cabin crew were very responsive. The seats were comfortable. There is none of the nickel-and-diming miserliness other airlines seem to specialize in. The service is prompt courteous and generous!,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,8,Fraser Ann,28th September 2014,Our return flights MAN-Munich LH2503/2 Aug 26 and Sep 23. Consistently reliable friendly and courteous staff. Cabin in reasonable condition. Very happy to fly Lufthansa on this route. We also flew return MUC-YVR LH476/7 on the same dates. Outbound 26 August. Inbound 23 September. The business class seats were fine we were in rows 4 and 11. For me row 4 was far more private. Seats fine but not as good as Qatar's 777 flights. Comfortable reclining and flat for overnight. Slept reasonably well. I'd do this again at the right price. Food fine with reasonable variety. Staff efficient without being engaging whereas staff on the Manchester leg were more friendly and charming on both flights than the long haul crew. Overall happy with experience but do think the long haul staff should be more engaging.,,,Business Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,3,Natalia Massingill,28th September 2014,LH436 from Krakow to Frankfurt flight delay 1 hour due to bad weather in Frankfurt end up missing connecting flight to Chicago by few minutes. Big confusion at the airport being sent from station to station 4 times before we finally got to ticket agent than we waited 4 hours to get new flight out of Germany for next morning! Frankfurt to Dusseldorf to Chicago and again delay of 40 minutes and almost missed Chicago flight again thank goodness the airport is small as we got on the plane at the last minute. Airbus is definitely more comfortable than the Boeing 747 - not enough leg room even for someone 5 ft 5 seats too narrow - misery for 9 hours. Staff very nice and pleasant.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,3,no
Lufthansa customer review,7,J Stein,24th September 2014,"I flew from Frankfurt to Newark NJ on the last leg of a 4-leg trip to Turkey and flew in Business Class on a 747. My seat was dirty with crumbs in the glasses holder wasn't able to use my own headphones for in-flight entertainment and the movies system was slow unresponsive and had few movie choices. I watched a DVD that I brought rather than dealing with these issues. The food was ok but unimpressive although the croissants were fresh and tasty. I thoroughly enjoyed the red wine and was constantly refilled as well as coffee when I switched and the seat was comfortable once I was able to manipulate my 6'1"" frame into a comfortable position. All in all the flight was fine but I wasn't as impressed as I should have been.",,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,,4,no
Lufthansa customer review,6,C Currie,22nd September 2014,LH721 PEK-FRA Airbus A380. Advance online seat reservation was not working but able to get an aisle during online checkin - which opened earlier than the advertised 23 hours before the flight so most good seats were gone. Seats are very cramped - 31 inch pitch is too small for a long-limbed 6 footer like me. Entertainment system was awful - screen far too close painfully slow the films were old and music content limited audio barely audible. On the plus side staff were excellent.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,,4,no
Lufthansa customer review,6,K Frech,22nd September 2014,Flight staff were very friendly and committed to providing good service.

Lufthansa customer review,9,Fargel Matthias,22nd September 2014,"Brand new airbus A330 from Munich to Vancouver. New inflight entertainment with rich variety of movies and music. However the sound volume was far too low for enjoying the acoustics. Seats in Economy improved. Best of all however: very clean washrooms during the entire 10.5 hr flight. Flight attendants went in with gloves quite frequently. Food in economy class was ok I always pre-book Asian Vegetarian which seems to be a ""winner"": tasty and sufficient.",,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,7,Eva Hoefer,19th September 2014,Unfortunately check-in was rather unfriendly and extremely picky about baggage numbers sizes and weights. Neither professional nor customer-oriented service. The actual flight was pleasant only food quality was not as adequate as during flight from MUC to YVR (poor seasoning pasta overcooked). Unfortunately no non-alcoholic beer on-board.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,8,C Hoffmann,19th September 2014,Flight form Munich to Malaga LH1834. Flight left on time and arrived 10 minutes early.

Lufthansa customer review,7,Samson Fung,19th September 2014,"LH 476 MUC-YVR 3 Sep 2014. Direct flight in a Airbus 330 which seems to be a small aircraft for such a long 10 hour flight. Food in Y class as bad as always on European airlines. Seats extremely narrow for such a long haul flight (OK for European or continental flights but for Intercontinental flights not enough space). Service as good as it can get in this class. Beverage OK but below standard compared for many airlines particularly in comparison to Asian or Gulf region carriers. Entertainment system really bad (old films that I can hardly remember from my youth). Seat distribution unclear and not well thought through (eg LH has an initiative for ""doctors on board"" and medics can subscribe to this program however flight attendants do not seem to be aware of this initiative in addition medics obviously are not listed thus unknown and do not get seats easy to be prepared for emergencies. Instead they are often seated in the middle of the rows thus hindering them to quickly react).",,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,,3,yes
Lufthansa customer review,1,D Bowtell,19th September 2014,LH 426 FRA to Philadelphia Tues 16th 1pm but changed to LH432 to Chicago at 5.10pm 16th. American connecting flight number to Philadelphia (arriving 1.15am today). Flight from Frankfurt to Philadelphia cancelled and rebooked on a later flight arriving almost half a day later. These things happen but the systematic rudeness and lack of consideration of the staff made matters worse. I've often found Lufthansa staff are among the most lacking in consideration of any airline.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,,3,no
Lufthansa customer review,5,G Baldacchino,19th September 2014,LH 475 Sept 14 2014 YUL to MUC. Great staff service that ensured my wife and I plus luggage were on this flight in spite of a non-through ticket and just 50 minutes of transit time. The flight itself was much less pleasant - cramped seats not enough foot room in front of seat and an entertainment system that leaves much to be desired.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,3,Christoph Günther,19th September 2014,I am traveling frequently with Lufthansa and am usually quite satisfied. On the positive side of LH415 I would like to mention that they managed to transfer my luggage although United co-chair LH9295 was extremely late. The seats on LH415 can however only be rated as less than adequate. LH does not yet offer any form of economy plus. The seat are both rather narrow (8 lines of seats in an A330!) and the spacing between them is completely insufficient for tall people. I will not fly this airplane in this configuration anymore. The provision of classical music is mostly absent.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,,3,yes

Lufthansa customer review,7,B Wintersperger,17th September 2014,LH 494 MUC-YYZ Sept 1 2014. Nice exit row seating with availability to Senators unfortunately the exit row reservation has now also become available for an extra charge limiting the benefit of the Senator status.

Lufthansa customer review,1,T Wynne-Jones,14th September 2014,"There are very few flights between London and Hanover so thinking Lufthansa was an organized airline my firm booked me a flight via Frankfurt. It's a mediocre flight from London to Frankfurt however the flight parked at the gate they did not use the finger instead passengers were all expected to get out at the rear of the aircraft and take a bus ride to another part of the airport (this seems to happen a lot with Lufthansa flights from London to Berlin and Dusseldorf too). After an involuntary tour of the airport I battled my way through security customs and immigration to get to the Hanover gate only to find the plane had gone. To my way of thinking this represents ""mis-selling"" as there is no way anyone is ever going to make the advertised connection in 30 minutes (not at Frankfurt anyway). Perhaps Lufthansa regard English passengers as ""under-people"". To add salt to my wounds Lufthansa made no apologies and just bumped me onto the next flight four hours later. I complained again at Frankfurt customer service which was a log wait amongst the flotsam and jetsam but was only offered a €10 coffee voucher which I declined as an insult. I can only assume that Lufthansa is now competing with German Wings for the most miserable service. Try and leave a comment on Lufthansa's web page and they actually believe people still use fax machines.",,,Premium Economy,,,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,1,no
Lufthansa customer review,8,Gallo Francesco,14th September 2014,I flew from Toronto to Munich (LH495) in Economy class on an Airbus A330-300. Clean sufficiently comfortable. No power access. Good dinner bad breakfast. Absolutely on time.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,8,Sara Kreil,6th September 2014,I flew with Lufthansa from Montreal to Berlin overnight on Friday. I had a very nice flight. The seats were comfortable the food was tasty the service was friendly and overall I was quite pleased. My only complaint was that the plane was very cold. Also the flight was quite expensive. However I am usually willing to pay a bit more for a Lufthansa flight. The inflight entertainment system was having some trouble as well. It was very very slow.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,,3,yes
Lufthansa customer review,10,Borowy Irene,6th September 2014,Last Sunday Aug 25 2014 I was flying from Warsaw to Frankfurt when the Lufthansa plane leaving for Frankfurt was delayed due to some unexpected circumstances. As a result I missed my connecting Air Canada flight from Frankfurt for Calgary. When I went to Lufthansa desk at the Frankfurt airport the ladies there were more than accommodating trying to offer me as many options as possible to get me to my destination. I opted for the next day flight to Calgary via Vancouver. The stay at the Interhotel at the Lufthansa expense was very pleasant great food and room made me forget about a snag in my return trip. But the biggest surprise was still awaiting me at the boarding time when I learned that my ticket was upgraded to Business Class. Excellent service.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,9,Uwe Langhammer,6th September 2014,Flew IAH-FRA-TXL and back FRA-IAH and First Class Service did live up to the title. The NEK in Europe might need some extra legroom instead of the empty middle seat. Friendly Crew great culinary experience and just a good way to go over the Atlantic. A380 is good way to travel.,,,First Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,3,yes
Lufthansa customer review,8,J Donahue,6th September 2014,Flew LH 454 21 Aug 14 FRA-SFO A380 and LH797 31 Aug 14 HKG-FRA B748. Great service provided in the air as well as on the ground. Food choices were good and fresh. Unfortunately the A380 still had the old angle-flat seat. The B748 had the new flat beds.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,9,Juraj Kovac,6th September 2014,PRG-FRA-SIN-FRA-HAM both trips with late evening departures. Compared to other airlines on the route Lufthansa is downright boring but absolutely efficient. The short-haul A320s have zero IFE and only a bare minimum in terms of onboard comfort but the handling and service is flawless. My 19.30 flight from PRG was delayed which would have prevented me from making a tight connection in FRA. Instead baggage drop-off staff already awaited me with a new boarding pass for an earlier flight which was delayed as well and rushed me through fast track to comfortably make my connection. LH even serves sandwiches on the 35min hop to Frankfurt. Both Singapore legs were on the A380 which is always a treat. The cabin is extremely basic and the AVoD is just average but the service is snappy and organized meals are good crews are friendly. It's hard to get a good night's sleep in economy but the overall experience is still as painless as it gets.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,10,Holme Stefan,1st September 2014,First Class Service in First Class Cabin. Well there might not be much justification to buy a first class intercontinental flight ticket since a business class flight will be a fraction of cost which may give your controller a hardtack. But if you just have to stay for a meeting in the US and return within 48hrs to your desk in Europe you might consider for your personal sake to spend more money just to arrive back home relaxed. Lufthansa new First Class offers an outstanding service to arrive rested ready to make decisions. Compared to some of the Gulf Region Airlines the Lufthansa first might be considered plain and functional but the service is professional and surpassing.,,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,9,A Casamax,1st September 2014,LH411 from JFK to Munich 23 August 2014. I sat in Business class together with my family. The comfort was satisfactory for the space the seats and the service. Staff was very friendly and professional food and drinks were of good quality. Overall I appreciated the service and quality of this airline. I am frequent traveler and I always prefer to travel with Lufthansa both in economy and business so I recommend it to everyone.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,8,Tercon Bojan,28th August 2014,Flew the brand new 747-800 on this Washington D.C. to Frankfurt route. Was my first time and was very curious about it. The upper deck business class is very quiet and has a private feel to it. I also like that you have a private storage compartment right below the window like on the upper deck of an A380. Lufthansa has made some innovative design choices. For example in the bathrooms the toilet seat and cover both have a separate handle so that it's easy to lift either up. Such a simple invention yet I've never seen it on other airlines. The new biz class seat is a huge improvement over the old angled-flat seat which is still used on all their other planes. It's a friendly configuration for if you're traveling with a friend the seats are slightly angled towards each other making it easy to converse. In sleep mode the seat is unfortunately not too comfortable especially since the footrest where your feet go is very narrow. The food and service was ok. They had a good selection of wines and the menu had a regional focus focusing on cuisine from the area you're flying from. Love the idea however taste wise it was not outstanding. Overall though a huge improvement from their old business class. I hope they upgrade the rest of their long-haul fleet with these seats.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,10,Ivan Dzhur,28th August 2014,I took six flight operated by LH this month. Two of these were long haul - EWR-DUS on August 3rd and MUC-EWR on August 26th the other four were intra european - DUS-VIE on August 4th LWO-MUC-DUS on August 16th and LWO-MUC on August 26th. All of the above flights were on time pro active and kind cabin staff and ground staff. Meals and drink service were great cabin crew always ready to offer refreshments and drinks on long haul flights. Hot towels served on long haul flight were much appreciated. Seat comfortable on all flights except one from MUC to EWR where LH Airbus 340-600 still had old economy class seats. Will certainly recommend Lufthansa!,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,6,A Wandschneider,28th August 2014,July 13th 2014 LH2067 HAM-MUC. LH0476 MUC-YVR. Aug 2nd 2014 LH0493 YVR-FRA. LH0016 FRA-HAM. Our flights were on time and regarding the soccer-final Germany-Argentina we received a special service - free wifi and cold- fresh beer. That was excellent. Lufthansa does not provide perfect space and service however as an economy-flyer I trust in the quality of the planes and I'm always satisfied with LH.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,3,yes
Lufthansa customer review,2,A Thomas,28th August 2014,Although I managed to check-in online with Lufthansa via Avianca given an earlier connecting La Paz to Bogota flight the latter did not let me print boarding passes told to report to the check-in counter. Thus I had to join 30-40 person long check-in queues at 2 am taking an hour to clear. There was a long layover of 14 hours in Bogota so connections via Star Alliance are not convenient. The seat assigned for the 11-hour Lufthansa LH 543 flight BOG-FRA on Sunday 24 August was totally different from one I selected online - 24D versus 55K and at odds with what I had requested on booking months earlier and as stated permanently on my Silver frequent flyer record. I asked for the seat to be changed but was told that this could not be done on the Avianca system only in La Paz by Lufthansa despite both airlines being part of Star Alliance. At Bogota airport I was informed initially by Lufthansa staff that this was due to overbooking and 'nothing' could be done. They also tried to put the blame on me for not informing them earlier or checking-in earlier. I had done my online check-in 24 hours ahead of Avianca flight which was about 38 hours ahead of the Lufthansa one - well before most others would have checked-in and so should have got my selected seat. I was then told of a 'special offer' of a business class upgrade of USD600 - another profit-maximising effort instead of service-recovery of a complimentary upgrade or even a USD100 one which I might have accepted in desperation. The seat was finally changed grudgingly - without apology or even a smile - at the gate to 55G at a part of plane and side I did not like at all.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,3,yes
Lufthansa customer review,10,Tercon Bojan,28th August 2014,On this very short 40 min flight from Frankfurt to Brussels Lufthansa managed to serve a full and very yummy breakfast.

Lufthansa customer review,10,A Fischer,26th August 2014,The most comfortable seats now in the new A330-300 in business as well as in economy the entertainment system actually works (though your own headset might be a bit better than the Lufthansa one in coach) and delicious food in business plus the usual chicken or pasta (sorry pasta is out) in coach. Don't worry the chicken is fine. What do you want more for your money? I did continue on Air Canada with expensive poor food in domestic headset you pay for but which do not work is that really necessary to save cost? I would rather fly on Lufthansa.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,3,Syska Matthias,26th August 2014,LH411 from JFK to Munich 18th August 2014. I sat in Economy class together with my kids. The comfort was more or less unsatisfactory because of the space between the rows the passengers around us and the service. Staff were not very friendly and motivating all additional drinks had to be requested by ourselves and their presence in the cabin was very low. Seemed that they were more interested in talking than working. I am frequent traveler and spend thousands of Euros on LH tickets every year and have experienced the following: the prices have increased and the service and quality decreased. I do not feel or see any value for money.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,,1,no
Lufthansa customer review,1,Tagariello Carl,26th August 2014,Aug 1 2014 JFK to Vienna flight OS88 operated by Austrian Air (through Lufthansa). Return Aug 14 2014 Prague to Frankfurt flight LH1397. Frankfurt to JFK flight LH404. My first and last trip with Lufthansa! I booked in Feb 2014 for a trip in Aug. My wife and I are senior citizens and booked bulkhead seating (knee problems). When we arrived at the airport we were informed that our reserved seats were given away. We were given no explanation and promptly given two middle seats in different aisles. When I protested I was told there was nothing that could be done. Later we were given middle seats next to each other. The TV screens did not work properly-a perfect ending to a terrible flight.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,1,no
Lufthansa customer review,10,Sean McCarthy,26th August 2014,ARN-FRA-MAN 21 August 2014. Flight left Stockholm on time. Professional and friendly crew. Aircraft had new space saver seats with a 30 inch seat pitch which for a 6 ft guy was comfortable. Lufthansa provided a pizza snack and beverages (including alcohol) on this flight. Transfer at Frankfurt was only an hour but travelling from a schengen to a non schengen country was a breeze despite the long walk. Second flight similar to first. Arrived in Manchester on time. Would recommend Lufthansa.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,9,M Tushishvili,26th August 2014,I had PAR-TBS-PAR via Munich by Lufthansa. Excellent service again with hot food and plenty of beverages to/from Tbilisi. The service is the best (together with Turkish airlines) on this route. The FA were very helpful and attentive throughout the flight. Lufthansa keeps outstanding quality on this route which is important for overnight flight.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,7,Emmanuel Karavelas,20th August 2014,"PEK-MUC July 22 Flight LH723. Aircraft Airbus A340-600. Although I had checked Lufthansa site and was informed that my flight would have the ""new Business Class service"" it turned out that the small prints rule: this aircraft had the old and outdated Business class seats which from my point of view cannot provide the comfort Lufthansa's competition offer as none of its positions (seating leaning fully extended) could offer satisfactory comfort. Cabin crew very efficient polite discreet and professional. Food wine and beverages more than average. IFE limited. Lavatories very clean throughout the flight. Cockpit and cabin crew announcements informative. Amenities of high quality.",,,Business Class,,,1.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,,5,yes

Lufthansa customer review,5,Tautz Hanno,18th August 2014,LH 414 7 Aug 2014 MUC-IAD. I have 3 complaints about the flight with my wife last Thursday: 1) With the online check-in I could not get a boarding pass. There was a message that a failure occurred but not which kind of failure and how to correct it. 2) There were two check-in lines at the airport. After 30 mins queuing Lufthansa personnel asked me for the boarding pass before I could continue in the line. As I could not get a boarding pass online or with the machine I could not go to the check-in counter. I had to queue in a second line. 3) At the other counter the seat reservation which we made 3 weeks before was cancelled. All this is very disappointing.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,3,no
Lufthansa customer review,7,Schnitzer Bernd,18th August 2014,We flew from Munich to Vancouver with LH 476. The airplane was in good shape and there were no delays. I flew with my wife who has Senator status with Lufthansa and I could experience how warmly she was welcomed by the crew. Unfortunately this led them to neglecting me to an extend that I had to be after them to get something else to drink that what my wife had asked for. Somehow many of the Lufthansa crews on long distance flights still miss the opportunities to show some kind of friendliness and one still has the feeling that one is sitting in a bus from A to B. The special meal (Asian vegetarian) was tasty and the wine selections was good.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,,3,yes
Lufthansa customer review,10,Michael Baker,18th August 2014,We chose to connect with LH 482 A380 in Frankfurt to get from Paris to Miami even though we could have gone non stop on Air France/Delta. A great and wise choice especially for business class seating. Entire top deck of the A380 is premium seating only 6 across in business all seats recline 180 and face forward. First class service in every regard!,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes

Lufthansa customer review,8,Robert Marshall,15th August 2014,Flew London Heathrow (LHR) to Larnaca (LCA) via Munich (MUC) on 22/07/2014 in economy. Used the refurbished T2 at LHR for the first time as this is Star Alliance's new gateway at LHR. Check in process was chaotic. 4 other Star Alliance flights (an earlier DLH a Brussels Airlines flight an Austrian flight and a LOT flight) also checking in at the same time in the 2 check in areas open. Absolutely dreadful system. Passengers at risk of missing their flight being constantly pulled out of the snaking queue system and fast tracked to check-in. LHR Star Alliance handling agent staff at check-in/boarding gate seemed to be in a bad mood and were minimally communicative if they bothered to reply to you at all. LHR to MUC on A320. Airbridge was 'out of order' so had to walk to aircraft. On board: nice clean plane. Friendly cabin crew. Excellent English language skills from both cabin and flight deck staff. 40 minute delay leaving LHR (20 mins due to broken airbridge and then another 20 mins in the queue on the taxi-way waiting for our turn to commence the take off roll). On time departure from MUC. A321. Airbridge available. Clean plane though looked a bit more worn than our earlier A320. Again friendly cabin crew. Excellent English language skills from both cabin and flight deck crew though announcements from flight deck were quite muffled and difficult to understand. Catering fine on both sectors. No IFE on either sector. Seats: typical uncomfortable Airbus minimally padded utilitarian economy seats. Leg room just about enough for a 176cm height person. Happy to recommend Lufthansa though their check-in arrangements at LHR need serious review. The staff service rating applies to aircraft staff. Their LHR ground handling agent's staff would score a zero.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,5,L Haycock,14th August 2014,When arriving at check in was told flight was overbooked. Blank seat tickets were issued and luggage taken for flight. At check in told we would have to wait on a reserve list. As this was part of a holiday trip and booked months ago I can not see how our booked seats where not available. These were paid for months ago so you now those seats are sold and therefore cannot understand how you can overbook. Latecomers should wait until all sold seats check in and then offer what is left to them not give away other peoples seats. This was LH2510 9 Aug. We finally got seats far apart from each other.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,,5,no
Lufthansa customer review,7,Sami Osman,14th August 2014,DXB-FRA. My economy experience was great! I was very surprised with the flight and service. The food was not excellent but neither was it poor - it was just right. I got my food on time and staff were very helpful seats were very comfortable. However the inflight entertainment was a little out of date and did not have many choices. Overall though I would definitely recommend Lufthansa.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,,4,yes

Lufthansa customer review,1,T Anderson,11th August 2014,I was very disappointed with my flight itinerary. When I called Lufthansa to book my outbound flight to Munich Germany I inquired that 25 minutes to arrive at the gate to my connecting flight out of O'Hare Airport was impossible but she assured me I should not have any issues. Well I did my flight was late and I had to run though a crowded airport to get a shuttle bus to the connecting flight gate (United Airlines flight UA 6115 and UA952 on July 4 2014). My flight arrived at 5.25 and my connecting flight starting boarding at 5.20. My inbound (return flight home) was the worst Lufthansa flight I had been on. The plane was a smaller plane only 1 lavatory to serve the economy area on the plane and the food was horrible. I am considering never flying Lufthansa again.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,1,no
Lufthansa customer review,5,Bernd Sonderhuesken-Puchtinger,11th August 2014,Staff on Lufthansa are normally very friendly and professional. Nothing to criticize. The seats in economy are a bit narrow - especially if the guest in front of you reclines the seat. The new onboard entertainment system on flight 477 from Vancouver to Munich is nice - as you have your own high quality touch screen with a standard 3.5 in plug for earphones. So your own (noise cancelling) headphones will work. You also get a USB charger on that. In my case the entertainment system did not contain any movies (probably introduced during service before the flight) and i was not able to watch any for the 11 hr flight.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,,3,yes
Lufthansa customer review,1,C Whitten,11th August 2014,Flew from Munich to Toronto August 7th (over 8 hours) and the audio on our seats (3 middle seats in the very last row of the plane) did not work the entire flight. The screens also were periodically unresponsive. The lights could not be adjusted (had to be turned on manually since seat panel was not working at all). One flight attendant was lovely - very helpful and apologetic. Others clearly did not care. Indeed one kept insinuating that we were not being patient enough with the screen - she finally believed it was the system's failure when she tried it. Although the helpful attendant reset the system it did not work (until the plane completely shut off after landing - then the panel started working). Also when the person in front of me reclined his seat I could barely move. The helpful attendant gave us chocolates at the end of the flight which was very nice. It was an extremely uncomfortable and frustrating flight. We had paid the same amount as all the other folks who had working electronics.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,,1,no
Lufthansa customer review,10,Valli Viviana,6th August 2014,LH476 on 27th July. Great flight very comfortable. Personnel very kind. I was upgraded to Business class and it was a great experience.

Lufthansa customer review,9,K Sutch,6th August 2014,Excellent Service on the flight from Munich to Toronto. I was upgraded to Business and it was a real treat. All in all the flight was very good. Lots of legroom flat bed to rest wonderful service and good food. If I could change anything: better trays (for food) - this is the only element that I don't think is very comfortable but this isn't a reason to score lower. The LH team was excellent as usual on the flight(s) and it was a wonderful end to being in Europe by having gotten the upgrade into business.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,10,Schulz Stefan,6th August 2014,LH 476 30th July 2014. Fantastic flight with bonus points from miles and more in first for the entire family to Vancouver.

Everything was perfect except for the luggage delivery in Vancouver which despite our priority tags came last.,,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,5,C Yiyi,3rd August 2014,Frankfurt-Greece Zurich to Munich Munich-Toulouse Toulouse-Frankfurt on different days all within 8 days in July. Very pleased with the service and smiles. Friendly staff. All are short-haul so no entertainment. There were one or two flights with proper meals but the others only had snacks and drink. The food was all right as they are very short. The seats were hard but has okay comfort level. Some times check-in get a little confusing for the crew but that's my own problem as I transferred a lot. Pretty satisfied overall!,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,8,T Eldem,3rd August 2014,BOS-MUC on A340-600. Smooth check-in with an exceptionally polite and efficient agent. The cabin was spotless with soothing colours and perfect temperature. The FA's were very attentive and maintained the professionalism and efficient service I am accustomed to from LH. The seats were the old angled business class seats which were comfortable in all positions except for sleeping as one tends to slide off the seat. The in-seat USB power did not work on any of the four seats my travel companions and I were seated in. The AVOD selection was limited and inferior to other transatlantic airlines. The meal service was prompt and the food was tasty. There was a wide range of beverage options with a good wine selection. Flight left and arrived on time. Lufthansa offers a good product with dependable service surprises are rare if any.,,,Business Class,,,2.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,9,M Kramer,3rd August 2014,LH 457 24th July. The food is great you'd always want another plate even in Economy. The service and the crews are always friendly and willing to fulfil every need. They did come through the cabin every 20 minutes offering a selection of drinks from a tablet to not disturb the passengers sleeping. Onboard even in Economy nearly every drink is included and so you'll never regret choosing Lufthansa! The only drawback is the inflight entertainment system installed on the A380's and 747-8's the new RAVE system they refit onto the A330/A340 fleet is great but sadly it isn't available upon delivery of the aircraft as manufacturers don't install this system. But though the selection of movies in different languages is great the only bad thing about the system on A380 and 747-8 is the screens are responding extremely slow and they are quite small due to a lot plastic surroundings. And the flight information is insufficient as the system doesn't show altitude speed (ground and air) flight heading wind speed and direction and such stuff. Overall great flights with just this minor drawback.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,10,Gnanadesikan Ram,3rd August 2014,I flew from Frankfurt to Washington on July 28 2014. The cabin crew were great and the service was fantastic. I ordered a vegetarian special meal and it was delicious. I was at one of the exit row seats and it was very cold. I talked to the crew about it and they took care of it immediately.

Lufthansa customer review,8,W Campbell,3rd August 2014,Flew Business Class round-trip LAX -Stockholm Stockholm-SFO. I flew the 747-800 and was really impressed with the new Business. I sat downstairs and had a seat in the middle section where every seat is an aisle. Spacious and comfortable. All flight attendants are gracious - would not say so much that the food was any better than UAL. In fact their little mousse dessert was nothing compared to UAL's Ice Cream sundaes. On Lufthansa they gave us a small tin for the amenity kit. The toilets are well stocked with amenities. Inflight entertainment on the new 747-800 was exceptional. So many choices. The return flight from Munich was delayed due to a broken aircraft. We left about 2.5 hours late from MUC. They offered everyone food vouchers and handled the delay very well. While the old Business Class seating on this A340-600 is not at all as nice as the New BC - it was ok. The crew were exceptionally friendly and very careful to make sure that everyone was taken care of.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,3,yes
Lufthansa customer review,4,E Matthews,31st July 2014,The flight I took 3 days ago (Vancouver-Munich) was one of the most unpleasant flights I have taken of late. I am a vegetarian but eat dairy and yet again I was served the most disgusting food and snacks sorely lacking in flavour and variety. It is always the same and having taken 4 long haul flights with Lufthansa in the last month the meals are predictable and a major let down every time. I take my own food on board depending on allowances at airports but the vegetarian option (lacto-ovo) is lacking dairy and it is very frustrating to see others getting food that makes me even more hungry. Further the seats are very uncomfortable compared to other airlines with leg room appearing to shrink. Flying with other airlines I never suffer back ache but do on Lufthansa flights. I have seen standards drop over the years and find partner/star alliance partners are usually better. The staff were very brisk and unfriendly on the latest flight snatching ear phones from my hands 30 minutes before landing and knocking my friends arms passing in the aisles with carts constantly. The onboard entertainment again is limited compared to other airlines with less choice in both films TV and languages.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,1,no
Lufthansa customer review,5,S Sheppard,31st July 2014,"LH410 on Sunday 20/07. Munich to JFK. The cabin crew are efficient but not especially friendly. Food is awful and always the same: Chicken or pasta (it's a well known joke between people traveling often to and from this destination). Not a fan of the new seats less comfortable than the old ones especially if you are more than 6""2 like me.",,,Economy Class,,,1.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,,5,no
Lufthansa customer review,10,S Hoffmann,29th July 2014,LH 3618 and LH 712 FRA-ICN. I went from Cologne Central Station to Frankfurt Airport Station by AIRail and flew from Frankfurt Airport to Seoul Incheon. The train ride was fast and convenient as well as the check-in at the train station at Frankfurt Airport. No queuing necessary so the transfer time of around 2 hours was almost too long since security checks were not crowded. The flight left on time and arrived 30 minutes early. The service was excellent the cabin very modern (new 747-8) and the inflight entertainment offered a lot of variety of current movies and TV shows. Another benefit is that the train ride from Cologne to Frankfurt is rewarded with Miles too. All in all it was an excellent flight experience and I definitely recommend flying Lufthansa.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,5,Arlotti Giovanni,29th July 2014,LH 104 Frankfurt - Munich 23 June 2014. LH 103 Munich - Frankfurt 21 July 2014. During both flights because of the short time at disposal and in spite of crew efforts beverages were only served to some people. I suggest they only serve cold pre-packed drinks and make sure they serve everybody.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,,3,yes
Lufthansa customer review,6,Yiyi Chen,29th July 2014,Frankfurt to Greece then Zurich to Munich Munich to Toulouse Toulouse to Frankfurt. Very friendly staff always smiling no IFE as they are all very short flights. Seats are hard and thin but still comfortable. Not all flights had meals but the food and drinks were alright. But now Lufthansa is famous to me for losing my luggage as I lost them twice with only 4 flights should have better luggage services.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,1,P Ries,29th July 2014,FRA-BCN A321 on July 24 LH1130. Flight out of FRA was delayed. The seats are like camping folding chairs. Very uncomfortable! Fortunately only a short haul flight. One out of three bathrooms not fully operational on a fully booked flight. The purser confirmed that she was aware of the bathroom situation and that she had already two prior flights on the same aircraft that day. During beverage service same purser opened a bottle of sparkling wine mid cabin and showered three rows of guests plus the interior. There was sparkling wine dripping off the ceiling and the overhead bins for the next 15 min. Highly unprofessional! All in all not acceptable.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,2,no

Lufthansa customer review,6,M Gruenig,27th July 2014,LH 418 6 July 2014. Overall pleasant flight on the 747-8. Anybody with any financial means should avoid economy. The problem is not with the airline but the travel companions. The only real drawback are the seats which are too narrow in economy to sit in without severe back pain. I avoided the bathrooms. Luckily the flight was only 8.5 hours. What surprised me a bit was the shape of some of the interior knowing that the 747-8 is only around for a short while (carpeting wall sidings). As usual the staff is really top notch and worlds apart from US carriers and - sad to say - AF / KLM or BA. This is a different flying experience though not Singapore quite yet either.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,6,E Simeone,27th July 2014,BRU-JFK via FRA 1st class - lounge in FRA is just perfect - Limo from and to plane also great service on board all is excellent service. B747-800 configuration is top notch except perhaps rest rooms because people from C class cabin tend to use this rest room. Apart from that baggage delivered on time. Will recommend.,,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,9,P Mikolajski,25th July 2014,I flew Lufthansa last week. Flight number LH451 from Los Angeles to Frankfurt.

Lufthansa customer review,8,J Egan,25th July 2014,"FRA-HKG. Departed from the ""Z"" section of the terminal which is a hike. Boarding handled efficiently though getting everyone to take their seats proved to be a challenge. This is one of the newer 747s and the Y class seats are very good: aside from a decent recline the front of the seat lifts a bit as you lean back taking pressure off your lower back. Meal and service were good and flight arrived early in HKG.",,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,9,F Juergens,25th July 2014,Last month I flew FRA-Malta-FRA. With the exception of one seemingly bored and unfriendly flight attendant both crews were highly professional obviously well trained attentive and friendly. Both flights on time the cabins spotless. Good Service as usual especially regarding drinks. The only problem are the snacks they offered. On the first sector a plastic cup of fresh fruit salad and yoghurt tasty but not at all filling. Much worse on the flight back: a slice of disgusting lukewarm pizza of low quality in a bland cardboard box without logo a really bad presentation. Such a pity that this reliable airline one of the very best in my opinion is failing again and again with the snacks and food which is offered. Very good ticket rate booked early in advance.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,10,Uwe Langhammer,25th July 2014,Our European travel was MUC-ZAD July 12 and ZAD-MUC-FRA July 20. We got upgraded on first leg and overall all 3 flights were on time and with friendly crews. Planes looked clean and new Eco Class seats were OK for the short flights. Happy Lufthansa has improved in terms of service and friendliness.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,5,Chris Zerial,25th July 2014,Flew 4 flights in total with Lufthansa whilst in Europe. Found the planes to be new and pleasant. The service from the check in staff and cabin crew however was nothing short of rude. Very blunt and did not pay any attention to staff during the flight (most were in conversation even during meal service). I asked the FA on one flight to store a small piece of art for me to which she said there was no room. Not impressed with their punctuality around boarding and departure.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,,3,no
Lufthansa customer review,5,R Pattison,25th July 2014,LH1785 Ankara to Munich and then onto Manchester. Not great the airline gave away my pre-booked seat with extra room. Not good considering I paid extra for it. Fortunately the check-in staff managed to sort me out a replacement. The airbus was not too bad the crew were very helpful. The inflight meal was absolutely dreadful. Neither I nor the crew could determine what form of protein it was. The horrible food and the airline giving my seat away soured what would have been a reasonable flight. I fly on business a great deal but not with Lufthansa again if I can help it.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,,3,no
Lufthansa customer review,7,J Hagen,17th July 2014,LH 1793. Overall a nice flight on time and efficient boarding and leaving the plane. Might be a surly morning but one of the attendants had an unnecessarily rude attitude. Just because I was slow to stand up (and crouch under the low ceiling) to leave the plane he asked me if I was ever going to leave and that other passengers wanted to get out as well. Never has this been a problem on any other airline. He also gave surly remarks to other passengers who didn't perform well enough. Sorry if this is a charm and humour I didn't pick up on though.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,7,Lanz Ulrich,17th July 2014,LH415 11 July 2014 Washington Dulles to Munich. I was lucky getting a seat with more space for the legs (front row). As usual I was very pleased to fly with Lufthansa. Unlike other times the seat comfort was not so nice I was not able to sleep. Could be either a matter of coincidence or the version of the seats on that plane. Looking nice and being brand new but pretty hard and not a good shape for my body.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,2,D Watkins,15th July 2014,Flight from Perth to Frankfurt via Singapore. Pleasantly surprised that the Lufthansa A380 flight was more pleasant (happy crew) and comfortable than the code-share Singapore airline flight Perth to Singapore. However the return flight from Toulouse to Perth turned into a nightmare due to thunderstorm causing delays into Frankfurt. The almost total lack of customer care while stranded over night at Frankfurt and a 7 hour wait to re- book (almost 5 hours of which was in a line on foot) was a disgrace. It is the fear of this recurring which means I will be highly unlikely to fly with Lufthansa again.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,,2,no
Lufthansa customer review,6,Yalcinkaya Yasemin,15th July 2014,I prefer Lufthansa whenever possible. But on this flight LH 494 from Munich to Toronto we had the 4 middle seats on row 40 and there was no arm room. The room for the legs is also quite scarce. Other than the uncomfortable seating everything else was OK. My son had stomach issues and the flight attendants were very helpful.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,3,yes
Lufthansa customer review,1,Venu Raj,15th July 2014,Vancouver to Munich LH 477 4 July 2014. I found the Food to be sub-standard for a European airline and they also only serve German Wines. The seats are so cramped in Economy Class that it is hard to stretch yourself. They give you warm napkins only on the onward flight and not on return flights. I was carrying my suits so I asked the flight attendant if he could hang my suit in the wardrobe for me and his body language was so obvious that he did not want to oblige my request! Only when I argued with him did he agree to hang my suits. Flight attendants are generally unfriendly they hardly smile and it seems that they are doing the passengers a favor! They generally make a big thing even when your baggage is overweight by 2 or 3 kgs they only allow 23 kgs per passenger in Economy. Compare this to Emirates where you get a generous Baggage allowance of 30 kgs per person on Economy. When I checked at Vancouver Airport for my return flight my baggage was only overweight by 4 kgs but one of the airline staff members was very kind and allowed me to check my Bag in. If not for her I would have had to certainly pay an excess baggage fare!,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1,no
Lufthansa customer review,9,A Wong,13th July 2014,"June 10 2014 LH 493 to Frankfurt. July 3 2014 LH 476 to Vancouver. We paid extra for exit row seats and were not disappointed lots of legroom. Only critique was that people tend to congregate around area for bathrooms which isn't a big deal but when they hang out there for more than half an hour and keep bumping into you while you're trying to sleep then it's annoying. Outgoing flight was 747 and seemed to attract more ""standers"" return flight was 330 and shape of cabin did not encourage people to hang around as much. Pleasantly surprised at number of meals and snacks during both flights lots of variety service was great and flight attendants went out of way to accommodate other passengers with young children. Look forward to flying Lufthansa again hopefully in Premium or Business Class next time.",,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,8,Johansson Robert,13th July 2014,LH 457 3rd July. Overall very good. The available leg space was however below all criticism. For some reason the A-C seats on row 44 on the 747-800 had about 1 decimeter less leg space than the other seats on the same row (and the rest of the plane). I have never been so cramped on an Intercontinental flight before (or any flight for that matter).,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,9,Heinz Julia,6th July 2014,My flight to Washington with Lufthansa in Economy Class was a very convenient one.

Lufthansa customer review,9,Gustafsson Magnus,6th July 2014,I travelled with LH1402 from Frankfurt (Germany) to Prague (Czech Republic) on June 23 scheduled 21.55-22.55. Due to late change of aircraft from the planned Airbus A321 to an Airbus A320 Winglets the flight was slightly delayed but the flight managed to depart before the awful night ban at Frankfurt Airport. The aircraft was only one week old according to the crew. That was obvious everything was extremely tidy and clean. However no IFE and still the same type of Recaro seats with any support for your head which I find very uncomfortable below industry standards. I was seated in Business Class on seat 4F and the service were excellent. Even on this very short flight a very tasteful salad was served and before the meal drinks were served. Right the way it should be drinks before the meal. An excellent flight and a very good experience and the cabin staff even addressed you by your name when serving excellent.,,,Business Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,8,Gustafsson Magnus,6th July 2014,I travelled with Lufthansa from Stockholm Arlanda Sweden to Frankfurt Germany on June 23. The aircraft on this service was an Airbus A321. I travelled in Business Class and was seated on 4A. The overall experience is very good and everything is well thought through with German precision. The cabin was very clean and tidy and the service was very good. The food served on this route was a cold dish but very tasteful. If to complain about something the service was not especially well co-ordinated. The meal was served first and it took approximately 10 minutes before any drinks were served. I would have expected the opposite in Business Class. Lufthansa does not offer any IFE on intra-European flights but offers very good inflight magazines. The main negative thing to my opinion is the very uncomfortable seats. Recaro slim fit with very limited comfort. There is no head rest available so bring your cushion or maybe two and the seats are very hard. The seat pitch is however according to industry standards. On this occasion I had a connecting flight from Frankfurt with 1 hour transfer time. The flight was approximately 25 minutes late into Frankfurt but there were no problems with my transfer.,,,Business Class,,,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,9,Kai Olesch,6th July 2014,MUC-CGN return (twice). I am always happy when I can book Lufthansa (work related) because it is such a reliable and punctual airline. The check-in and boarding is very easy the planes are always clean a little snack and two drinks are provided and I can choose my favourite newspaper. Usually the crew greets with a smile and has a service-orientated attitude. The seats are a bit hard but for one-hour domestic flights this is no problem.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,0.0,,4,yes

Lufthansa customer review,9,D Collard,3rd July 2014,Vancouver-Munich-Geneva (4 June 2014) and return (16 June 2014). Flights on time; luggage delivered promptly; cheerful and hard-working FAs throughout making several juice and water runs on the long-haul flights. YVR-MUC and return: A330-300 with 2+4+2 seat layout. Two proper meals served the usual chicken or stuffed pasta as the mains (and for overnight flight YVR-MUC an omelette as the second meal). The main problem with A330 and A340 aircraft generally is poor seat design in economy. Window seats leave a 5cm gap between the armrest and fuselage wasting space and very uncomfortable for anyone trying to lean against the fuselage to sleep. The two outboard seats (window plus aisle) are supported by two central stanchions that rob passengers of foot space. No standard carry-on bag will fit under the seats in front and more foot space is taken up by entertainment boxes. YVR-MUC flight had these problems. However MUC-YVR return flight had a new A330 interior with far better seat design: it still left the 5cm gap between the armrest and fuselage but the two supporting stanchions were at the very ends of the pair of seats leaving proper foot space and enough room that two full-sized carry-on bags could be placed under the seats in front if desired. AVOD offered a vast array of films music and television programs (even binge-watching programs like the complete first season of the US House of Cards). MUC-GVA and return: E195 with 2+2 layout with seats more comfortable than on an A330. Even a sandwiches-and-drinks service for these one-hour flights. Trip rating would be 8 for the old A330 seating 10 for the new A330 seating.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,8,Hoefle Walter,1st July 2014,Lufthansa has an excellent first class product. The seat and bed comfort is excellent. Caviar is still served but the portions tend to get smaller than before. The wine selection is always interesting. Food is good but the offer in the first class lounge in LAX not up to European first class standard. In the on board entertainment you might not find the latest films but it's a good cross selection. The atmosphere and color scheme of the newly designed cabin is very pleasant. Bathrooms are bigger on the 380 than on the 747. The content of the amenity bag is rather disappointing. Selection of reading material is good although I would prefer some travel or culinary magazines. The friendly staff will generally address you by name.,,,First Class,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,8,K Beckhaus,1st July 2014,LH415 IAD-MUC 3 June 2014. It was easy to upgrade last minute. In business class it was a very comfortable flight overseas. The aircraft was clean staff were very friendly and perfectly reserved at the same time space was sufficient with having one of the new seats which can be moved almost completely horizontal and the food and beverages were fine as well. LH is definitely my preferred airline between Europe and America.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,4,yes

Passenger handling at the airport was superb pick-up from aircraft escort to lounge passport formalities all done while we relax. The First Cabin was fully booked and we had two stewards taking care plus the cabin chief checking in occasionally. Aside from the splendid service like in a gourmet restaurant our crew was very cordial and made sure our time was as enjoyable as possible. The only downside I can remember is that the air-conditioning was quite draughty and could not be reduced.,,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes

Even if the flight tickets are a bit expensive I think they provide a reliable service and have a good customer service.

The Inflight Entertainment didn't respond very quick on fingerprints and some of the movies are not particularly new. I saw the same movie-titles on my flight with this airline 8 months ago.

Lots of space entertainment system finally up to date with hi-res displays good selection etc. However lots and I mean lots of restroom traffic. LH went cheap and only installed 2 restrooms for middle section of eco class to cram in 2 more rows (however more legroom on this new plane). Ridiculous and therefor many people waiting in line in front of and around your seat at all times.

Lufthansa customer review,2,Robert Redfern,18th June 2014,I connected to LH at Frankfurt from a United flight originating at SFO. The arrival and departure at FRA both involved aircraft parked on remote pads and being ferried on stuffed buses to the terminal buildings where insufficient gate space apparently exists. As I was about to get stuffed onto a bus an imperious LH gate agent demanded I surrender the bag in which I carry my CPAP machine. She couldn't have cared less that I was told to keep close hold on it on all my travels and other airport staff have no problem treating it as carry-on. Furthermore there was plenty of bin and underseat space on the flight. Other than that nastiness the flight itself was fine and LH probably deserves its 4-star rating excepting for transfers at FRA.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,,2,yes
Lufthansa customer review,3,Nima Barraci,18th June 2014,LH418 8 June FRA-IAD. I am very disappointed by the new flagship of Lufthansa or to be more precise of its Economy Class cabin. While the cabin itself is very comfortable from an environmental point of view - pressure humidity and noise - Lufthansa simply put uncomfortable seats into the great fuselage. They are too hard and there is not enough leg room. Even for an average 1.83m 79kg male sitting in these seats is a pain. The food is just below anything. One does not even need to compare it to the far better airline meals of Air Canada to come to this conclusion. Privileges for Lufthansa status customers are a joke. The Senator lounge in Dulles is more like a shoe box. Only the staff is making the difference as usual. Great staff on board and on ground is the single reason besides the direct connections why I still fly Lufthansa.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,2,no
Lufthansa customer review,8,Ld Pierre,18th June 2014,LH451 on 11 June from LAX to FRA. As usual Lufthansa's service - staff food and entertainment - was excellent though it was a bit tough to get the touch screen to react. The economy seats on the new 747-800 however leave something to be desired. While the legroom is alright the seat is very narrow doesn't recline very much not very comfortable on a 10 hour flight.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,8,F Bertoni,16th June 2014,GRU (Sao Paulo) - FRA (Frankfurt). Impressed with the new Boeing 747-8. Would expect it to be less noisy though. Not a single seat free all three classes were packed. I have to say that the new seat Lufthansa has chosen for this 748 is quite ok far better than the A340-600 one's. Cabin crew ok but a couple of members were everything but polite. Usual long-haul dinner choice (pasta or chicken) usual breakfast. Arrived in FRA 25 minutes before schedule. I keep saying Lufthansa and SWISS beat whatever European airline.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,1,B Bayes,16th June 2014,My wife and I booked a return ticket leaving Heathrow to Caracas Venezuela via Frankfurt. The final part of our journey was an internal flight to Barcelona Venezuela where we had planned to visit family. This part of the journey was without incident the return flight was a nightmare. We were due to leave Caracas on May 2013. We started our journey very early leaving to take internal flights from Barcelona to Caracas. Upon presenting ourselves at check in we were informed that our tickets had been accidentally canceled and that it was an internal error of the airline and would be corrected. Another person was called to the desk from the 1st class check in who said that the flights had been cancelled and that we could not travel as a refund had been issued. No explanation was offered and no one knew on whose authority our tickets had been cancelled. We were told the only way we could travel that day was to buy another ticket for nearly £3.000 money which we didn't have available at the end of our holiday. The desk attendants refused to help us in any other way.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1,no
Lufthansa customer review,7,Calcan Gabriela,16th June 2014,I traveled on the LH431 flight as a return trip from the US. Considering my initial flight was ok I was quite dissatisfied with LH431. It didn't leave on time (at least 30 minutes of lateness) the food was less varied and less tasty there were malfunctions at the entertainment service and the wi-fi network was out of order. The staff were friendly and well-prepared as usual. I will travel again with Lufthansa.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,9,James Wallace,13th June 2014,Munich to Chicago in Economy on an Airbus A340-600. Fasten seatbelt sign turned off five minutes after take-off and not put back on until 30 minutes before landing. Hot towels provided before lunch and after snack. Real tableware used with the lunch not plastic. Free alcohol provided before lunch wine with dinner and two choices of after dinner drinks provided. Five economy toilets were provided in the basement of the plane which was a nice stretch and avoided bad smells in the cabin. Cabin crew were professional and friendly. The seats are very tight luckily the seat next to me was empty. However the flight was nearly full.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,7,Gerwin Arthur,13th June 2014,LH431. Service and food was good. I travelled with my wife and it was good that we could book two separate seats at the back of the plane so other passengers would not disturb us during the sleeping period.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,3,yes
Lufthansa customer review,8,Niewel Manuela,13th June 2014,LH431 ORD-FRA 3/6/14. Aircraft and flight were excellent however the cabin crew were not satisfactory. Service was quite slow and at the same time quite hectic crew were a bit unfriendly did not come back after a request when I went into the galley they at first ignored me talking to each other. On the flight to Chicago this was completely different LH430 30/5/14.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,8,Tegelkamp Doris,12th June 2014,LH 430 7/6/14. As usual cabins were very clean tidy and everything was in extremely good condition. Service as usual very good attentive and friendly. The vegetarian meal was also very good same for the beverages. Considering we were in economy class even the wine was good. The snack prior to landing is not tasting good and of low quality. A simple sandwich with cheese or a soup (pumpkin tomato) would be better and taste better.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,1,Georg Konstanznig,12th June 2014,June 8th - flight LH450 from Frankfurt to Los Angeles. After take-off when the aircraft was at cruising altitude I needed to visit the bathroom. The flight attendant advised me in a very rude way to get back to my seat. We asked for wine during the flight and were advised to wait for the next service. LH crew usually walks through the aircraft with water etc. This crew did not. The food they served was not good. Overall LH450 flight on Sunday June 8th was the worst experience I have had with Lufthansa.,,,Premium Economy,,,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,,1,no
Lufthansa customer review,9,F H Koehler,10th June 2014,I flew from TXL to MUC with LH. As 4U operates almost all flights from TXL nowadays - having a LCC service - I am always glad to get on a LH flight. The flight was very early in the morning with no delay and very quick check-in at TXL. The service - even if decreased over the years - was including snack and drinks not worth complaining. Good things at LH are the seat comfort being better then with the usual LCC at SXF e.g. and a very good choice of newspapers. As for a rather short flight I really enjoyed the flight and prefer it over other airlines.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,10,Jeff Michel,10th June 2014,ZRH-FRA-GOT. No problems with the flights (although first one a bit delayed). Staff attentive and efficient and planes clean and neat. The sandwich they serve is Economy for the flight is Mozzarella Egg Plant and Aubergine! What on earth makes them think that this is a good combination and why not just serve a cheese sandwich? Judging by the amount of them left by passengers this is a common view point. Overall very good service but trying a little too hard to make a basic sandwich snack into something almost inedible.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,8,Michael Carlson,10th June 2014,JFK-MUC. Always a pleasant flight on Lufthansa. However I thought the seats seemed narrower then on previous flights. Not as much seating room. Food was also not as good as usual. Breakfast was kind of chintzy. Or maybe I just don't like muffins for breakfast. Also not as many movies or TV shows to choose from.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,8,Bradesko Marjan,10th June 2014,June 1 LH 440 FRA-IAH: Seat 87C - not able to exit any video (touchscreen) had to use the console all over again to restart. Inbound: June 5 LH 431 ORD-FRA Seat 45C. Technically superb mainly on-time unfortunately I had problems with entertainment system on the outbound flight and was unable to recline the seat on the inbound flight - severely impacting my comfort.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,8,Buettner Thomas,10th June 2014,"Flight LH 408 from Dusseldorf to Newark on April 26th and from Chicago to Dusseldorf on May 10th 2014. Both Planes had the same 2-4-2 Seating in Economy Class and are equipped with the new RAVE IFE-System. Seat Pitch is 32 inch and width 17.5 inch which is ok for ""midsized"" Travelers. Tray table is fixed in the frame of the seat so it doES not shake if the Person in front is moving. Wide selection of Movies (up to date or older) Music or other Inflight Entertainment. Beverage Service frequently (also during the night flight back to Dusseldorf) first served approx. 20 minutes after take off. Lunch was the typical ""Chicken or Pasta"" my choice was Chicken which was a Curry Chicken and quite good. Flight Attendants were all nice and offered a solicitous service. Breakfast on the flight back was a little bit ""well arranged"" could be served a little bit more. Anyway it was a quite comfortable trip in economy class.",,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,6,Metz Ulrich,9th June 2014,Check-in ok flight was ok but 40 minutes late. Service was friendly. The flight information did not work at all on any screens. I would have expected to get more spoken information during the flight. General: The reduced crediting of miles by booking class is not customer friendly at all. Special upgrade programs: I never succeeded in getting an upgrade to business class with miles online typically a message appears: Not available no matter when.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,,2,yes
Lufthansa customer review,8,C Mayr,8th June 2014,MUC-BRU on A319 and E195 flight from Munich was very comfortable as the leg space was very good. Flight was on time and the friendly cabin crew served a tasty sandwich and full bar service. Return flight on E195 was one hour late due to late income of the aircraft. I was always a big fan of the Embraer plane but this time I was very disappointed. The seats are cramped and not at all comfortable. Cabin crew again was very friendly. Lufthansa is a very good and reliable airline in my opinion.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,,3,yes
Lufthansa customer review,9,Tommy Desmet,5th June 2014,MUC-BRU in June 2014. Flight was delayed with about 15 minutes due to late arrival from WAW. Cabin clean and comfortable on this Embraer 195 jet. Excellent crew again drinks and tasty sandwiches were offered on this short flight with a smile. To be recommended!,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,10,Jonathan Turner,5th June 2014,I was lucky to receive a complementary upgrade to business Class for my flight FRA-LAX. As usual in Lufthansa Business Class the service was excellent personnel always polite and attentive. The inflight entertainment was of best quality in terms of hardware but fell behind competitors in breadth of offering where eg Singapore even in economy has at least 5 times the amount. Lufthansa's service is more conservative than eg Virgin which suits my personal tastes more. I paid for a flexible economy class ticket for the trip FRA-LAX returning JFK-FRA which was in my view expensive but LH was the only carrier able to offer non-stop on both legs - so LH scores again over competitors in this case on global reach. In the past I have been a regular international flyer with LH having had Senator status for at least 10 yr. However this has lapsed and I have recently been travelling mostly as an economy passenger. Accordingly I cannot accurately compare the current standard of LH business with many other competitors with the exception of Singapore and Emirates who unfortunately offer better seat comfort and entertainment. The aircraft on LH450 was a 747-8 which offered less seat breadth in the reclining position than the A380s of Singapore and Emirates.,,,Business Class,,,3.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,,3,yes
Lufthansa customer review,8,Spyridon Tzamtzis,5th June 2014,LH 475 31 May 2014 from Munich Germany to Vancouver Canada. The airplane interior of this Airbus A330 is modern and the entertainment system significantly improved comparing to the one fitted in most of the long haul airplanes of the company. Probably they start updating the outdated entertainment system used for in the last 5 years which was famous for its poor performance poor quality of video instability of system and small number of choices when it comes to movies and music. The food is good in terms of quality and quantity. The stewardesses are friendly and make you feel comfortable. The seats in economy class are narrow offering limited inclination of the back. Very uncomfortable definitely below average comparing to other big players like Qatar Emirates Singapore Turkish. Finally as always Lufthansa arrived on time.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,4,yes

Lufthansa customer review,9,Michael Thumm,4th June 2014,I had my last flight with Lufthansa on LH430 from Frankfurt/Germany to Chicago on 05/31/14. We had a new 747-800 which was really nice! Also came with some reasonable space for the legs in Economy (I am 189cm tall) however all the seats in new airplanes today look good but completely lack lumber support. Very good and friendly service! Good food and no additional charges did apply for a glass of wine! Keep that up Lufthansa! Also very clean and friendly looking airplane. And finally many choices for the entertainment program (movies) - very good! However I will never understand why Lufthansa does not enable the program once passengers are boarding and leaves it running until at the arrival gate. Most people use their own headphones anyway.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,2,Marre Rodrigo,4th June 2014,"I have made at least 8 business class segments in long haul flights in Lufthansa in the last 12 months and can certainly say that the service is poor. The 747-400 that I flew from Buenos Aires to Frankfurt and Frankfurt to Tokyo are old the business class is in bad shape the seats are uncomfortable and have the most uncomfortable inclination. The entertainment system is outdated and limited. Catering is at economy class level. Service is no better especially on the flights to Buenos Aires flight attendants appear tired uninterested in helping and some just plain rude. Service is slightly better on the flight I took to Tokyo and Hong Kong to Munich which makes me wonder if the Latin American market is just less interesting for this carrier. In any event the crew attitude appears in general as ""just do not bother me"" never a reply to the call button. I am a frequent business flyer and definitely regret to have chosen this airline and will avoid using this service again if I can. One final comment headphones are attached to the seats and on two flights I had to take the headphones covers that had been left from a previous passenger in order to put the new ones provided to me that is definitely not good service and not a good hygiene standard.",,,Business Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1,no
Lufthansa customer review,8,Carla Conti Baker,4th June 2014,Flying with Lufthansa is always a positive experience to me: reliable punctual efficient. I recently flew from Frankfurt to Los Angeles flight 450 Economy class and on my return flight LH 453 from Los Angeles to Munich I was able to upgrade to Business class by using my Miles and More account. Compared to the Economy class the Business class seats are very comfortable allowing to stretch completely and have a nice rest so that the flight time seems to be much shorter. Also the connecting flights to Verona Italy with Air Dolomiti were perfectly on time. I only wish that the fares to fly in Business class were not so pricy i.e. more affordable then I would book all my travels with Lufthansa in Business class.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,4,yes

Lufthansa customer review,8,B Ziegahn,2nd June 2014,May 26 2014 LH 431. Good service and food. Nice inflight entertainment with seatback video screens.

Lufthansa customer review,1,M Marte,2nd June 2014,Flew yesterday from Munich to LAX. Seats arranged in bulkhead 8 months ago only to find agent and Seatguru were wrong (6ft long legged female). We kept getting delivered special meals which we hadn't ordered nearing identical each time which were just as bad as the regular meals zero air-con in our section very grumpy attendants many people in our section asked about the air-con but nothing was done.

Lufthansa customer review,4,W Pierson,2nd June 2014,LH458 MUC to SFO A340-600. Business class without the new seats actually a rather inferior product and the new seating needs to be much better. Mediocre food with a veal dish for the first meal that consisted of two bites of dry overcooked meat. The meal before landing consisted of curry wurst and a small salad. Really German food is great but curry wurst as the featured food on a $5000 round-trip ticket? Service was sufficiently warm and efficient. In sum Lufthansa will reliably get you from point to point (as long as the pilots are not on strike) but it's really an inferior product (a recent Delta business class flight from ATL to Madrid was far superior in every way e.g. food comfort service).,,,Business Class,,,2.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,,1,no
Lufthansa customer review,9,R Baumgartner,2nd June 2014,I flew on May 26th 2014 with LH 415 from Washington Dulles to Munich.

Lufthansa customer review,7,F Martin,29th May 2014,LH 424 Munich - Boston. The Lufthansa Economy product provides mostly ok standards. Current economy seats are nearly the same (bad) experience as for every airline. Preferred check-in and Lounge due to Airline status do make the pre-flight procedures a good experience. For this particular flight crew were very attentive serving additional drinks throughout the flight. The inflight entertainment system could use a few more recent films. On time landing and overall no issues.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,6,Georg Zechner,29th May 2014,MUC-EWR economy was a great flight on a 340-600. But the return leg from YUL-FRA was a disappointment. Old 340-300 no USB chargers a terrible screen late departure and arrival without explanation and dinner was served by only 2 teams for the entire economy class one by aisle which means that we in the back (row 42 of 27 or so) got ours an hour after they began. This also meant on a 7 hour flight that there was little time between dinner and breakfast. In flight entertainment is pretty poor - 3 weeks between the flights and they were still showing the same episodes of TV shows. Food was nothing special especially the breakfast was an overly sweet muesli bar a muffin and some fruit. So a mixed bag. The crew was ok though.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,8,Anthony Gibbons,29th May 2014,Rio to Barcelona via FRA. Had already travelled 17 hours from NZ before taking Lufthansa but crew were warm efficient. Could see I was looking fatigued even on departure and crew got everyone fed and watered soon after 10pm take off. In first row of economy on 744 which meant no one could recline into my face! Seat ok and legroom in first row restricted by bulkhead. IFE didn't work in my row but not fussed as tired (purser handed out 25 euro voucher to use on return to Rio. Appreciated). Teriyaki chicken a strange choice out of Rio (impression coloured by horrible experience of teriyaki chicken on Hawaiian) but tasted better than looked. Campari enjoyed as aperitivo and Baileys as digestivo. Previous LH experiences have been lacklustre but felt the crew were personable and not the usual robots. All in all v satisfied. LH is a reliable airline offering great service and fair prices. Look forward to return flight to Rio this weekend but bound to be full of football fans pre World Cup!,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,,5,yes

On the VNO-FRA sector they served a surprisingly good and filling breakfast I hadn't expected anything at all. FRA-CPH sector staff served a pudding and they came around with drinks twice on this 1:15 flight. Staff were very welcoming. Seats could be softer but still there was plenty of legroom.

Air-hostesses / Stewards were friendly and attentive - a welcoming smile goes a long way during a long haul trip . Was pleasantly surprised to receive an upgrade to Business Class on my connection from Frankfurt to Chennai.

Lufthansa customer review,9,A Freud,28th May 2014,I had the pleasure to travel on new B747-8i from Frankfurt to Washington Dulles and back to Munich on Airbus - both equipped with the new seats. There's a big difference to the old ones! The seat is stylish and completely flat. Inflight movie selection is great now as well as the earphones. What I like most about Lufthansa is their efficient consistent and very friendly service onboard. The food was like a restaurant. Wine selection fine but could be better and wider. Unfortunately they don't offer cappuccino or espresso. Business lounges are a great plus. Staff at US airports should be trained to be friendlier.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,1,Kjeld Buelow,26th May 2014,"Flew Business Class - Frankfurt-Shanghai and Shanghai-Munich. This is not Business Class at all. The inclined flat beds are hard and it is not possible to lie on the side due to the curve of the leg rest. The food was at best ""better tourist class"" lukewarm and without any finesse at all. With the exception of a New Zealand white the wines were simply lousy. Very little selection. Will never fly Lufthansa Business Class Again.",,,Business Class,,,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,,1,no

Lufthansa customer review,6,Phillip Solomon,25th May 2014,I travelled between FRA and JNB on the A380. Like most I was disappointed that this state-of-the-art aircraft was not equipped with the lie-flat bed even though the website indicated that these flights would have them. Regardless I was able to find some level of comfort (eventually) on the angled beds - one has to play around with it until you find that comfort spot! Service overall was good and efficient and the food was fine as far as airline food goes. Nothing fantastic but then again nothing too bad.,,,Business Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,3,yes
Lufthansa customer review,9,R Kunst,25th May 2014,Johannesburg-Frankfurt. Excellent flight albeit economy on A380 and there was ample space for stowing hand luggage. Staff efficient and very friendly to start off a drink and some pretzels then dinner service (chicken or pasta) with drinks again coffee and liquor breakfast included scrambled eggs.

Lufthansa customer review,9,S Kolping,21st May 2014,I notice a lot of improvement at Lufthansa as they want to reach 5 star status. Hong Kong - Frankfurt boarding well organized. New Boeing 747-800 good Economy seats and improved inflight entertainment selection. Even a menu card in Economy Class. Food was really good for this service class. First a dinner with Asian or European selection and before landing hot breakfast. They should improve the presentation of the hot dish (tray and extras are fine) and serve warm bread these are always cold and hard. Beverage selection extraordinary. Staff very professional friendly efficient and helped mothers with their kids. I think it's an excellent airline when travelling with a child. There should be more lavatories in Economy class. No amenity kit. Blankets and specially pillows of high quality with real feathers. Plane change to Madrid in Frankfurt: Arrival in the new terminal aera Z hassle free and smooth. Plane to Madrid full. Another hot breakfast was served. Crew very charming and attentive again. No entertainment system - but's that's okay for short flights. Moving map should be introduced. Swiss has it on board even on intra Eruopean routes. In all great experience professional punctual and I felt very safe. But they have to work on the details for the 5 stars: presentation of hot meals hot bread amenity kit better arrival service in Frankfurt for passengers that don't know this giant airport. And entertainment system on short flights.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,10,Colin Pay,20th May 2014,LHR-FRA MUC-LHR A319 out A320 return. Both flights left on time 20 minutes late arriving at LHR due to air traffic not the airlines fault. Crews very good. Beer and sandwich both legs.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,6,Ariel Avitan,20th May 2014,The flight was OK. The seats were not comfortable and no preferred seats for Senators were offered to me. Food was OK. The flight attendants were good. The entertainment system was stuck for a while and the PA system was very loud.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,3,yes
Lufthansa customer review,1,B Neumann,20th May 2014,I used to have very high expectations on Lufthansa which was wiped out with my recent business with them. The flight attendants were rude and never responded to call lights instead they turned it off without responding and I have to get to the galley each time for a cup of water. Mine was a long intercontinental flight with total of 19 hrs flights. The seats are congested and old. Poor quality entertainment system one of headphone speakers not working replaced with another one with without much difference. My 2nd flight was delayed almost 70 mins.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,,2,no
Lufthansa customer review,7,V Peang,19th May 2014,ABZ-FRA-BKK return. Good start to the journey with priority (Business Class Check-in) since I am an FT member. Skipped past a very long queue. 2 luggage of 23 kg checked-in was a nice touch. ABZ-FRA was full good service by the crew with snack and beverage. Not plenty for 2 hrs flight though. Access to Business Lounge is a nice way to spend 2.5 hrs transit with food and plenty to drink as well as shower! FRA-BKK flight was not full and managed to get 2 seats free so get some living spaces for the next 11 hrs. Great crew with smile and helpful. The only downsides are the too hard thin seat for long haul flight and poor selection of entertainment. Departure flight's aircon was set to too warm made it quite hard to get to sleep but it was a one-off fault. Return flights great. Food is more than average. Quite pleased with it. Overall a very good experience with rooms to improve. Definitely recommend Lufthansa especially when the fare is very competitive.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,9,A Bittermann,19th May 2014,FRA-BKK with onward flight on Thai Airways to SYD. Excellent service by ground staff and cabin crew. Food was outstanding and I managed to sleep throughout the flight. Return flight connecting from SIN on SQ970. BKK-FRA also in F then FRA-HAM in Business. Again a good overall experience though I have to comment on the ground services upon my arrival in FRA. The flight was delayed and it was almost impossible to get to the next gate on time. I would have expected some kind of assistance by LH ground staff in order to make my connection. Other airlines offer this service even to their business class passengers. This could certainly be improved. Both long haul flights were on a A340 with the old First Class.,,,First Class,,,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,8,M Awatramani,19th May 2014,For transit Munich Airport was good. The flight from Zurich to Munich was good with good service. The next flight from Munich to Vancouver was good too only I didn't like the food choice and the way they presented it. If you can improve little on food variety it will be really good.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,8,O Gross,19th May 2014,Overall great Service from assistance at the ticket counter upgrading to Business Class on miles to the service on board. Check in was efficient for Business Class.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,3,yes
Lufthansa customer review,8,Christopher Brandt,19th May 2014,New Business class is worth flying. Lufthansa made a big improvement at inflight service. Nevertheless the service at the check-in desks in the US need to be improved. Overall it seems Business class is getting better while Economy is getting worse. So for Long flights you should think about upgrading or buying Business from the beginning.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,1,J Brueckel,17th May 2014,"Overall a very good product in First Class. Ground service at other airports is not on the same level as Frankfurt or Munich but that's to be expected. Food quality is good but could still be improved. One point I would like to critique is that the drinks menu promises a choice of champagne but usually there is only one of the choices on board. While I was never dissatisfied with the champagne that was offered it annoys me to be offered a choice only to hear that there really is no choice. Another points I would like to make is about the inflight entertainment system. First off I have to say that it has improved tremendously on the content side. Sadly there is still no improvement on the user input side which is very unresponsive and on the design of the ""Lufthansa Media World"" is still confusing and overly complex. Service from the flight attendants was very good but felt a bit scripted and unenthusiastic. The seat is excellent for lounging as well as sleeping and has plenty of adjustment options. A nice extra for the seat would be a massage function like you get on Swiss First and many other competitors.",,,First Class,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,8,Krzysztof Majczak,17th May 2014,I rated Food and Beverages less than perfect” because of the chicken being served : I'm allergic even to the odor of it. Seats less than perfect” because on the flight to Europe the spacing was very tight return was much better a newer airplane model. Due to all the security checks and their cost my last trip overall experience is a far cry from how pleasurable traveling used to be thus rating is less than perfect but I need to admit that Lufthansa personnel makes all efforts to make the nuisances as painless as possible. New Airbus model touch screen entertainment -– simply the best and the easiest; especially the flight tracking!,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,2,Kurt Kaibel,17th May 2014,LAX-FRA. Seats 45 B+C was poor with faulty design of folding tables. The rice and vegetables at dinner were overcooked Digestif service was too quick the bread rolls were served very cold and only on request. During the sleep / overnight period an night inadequate supply of drinks (2 times in the cabin to offer water only). There was no distribution of Toblerone. On our outward flight LH 452 all was great - 5 stars!,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,,3,no
Lufthansa customer review,1,R Graeber,16th May 2014,A330 FRA-IAD business class. LH's business class product on this aircraft is unacceptable. I never thought I'd say United beats them in every respect - but on this flight they did. Angle-flat uncomfortable seat. Ridiculously clunky AVOD with poor selection. Food - geez. Bite size piece of veal. No easily accessible headphone jack? Seat barely worked - had to wiggle the switches back and forth many different ways to get the seat to recline. A failed experience in every respect. I had a fully flexible C class fare booked on UAL and to get home two hours earlier switched to this flight. While it was nice to see the family 2 hours earlier I was astonished at how poor this product is. I hope (and am sure) that the 747-8 and other newer airplanes are better - this thing needs to be retired.,,,Business Class,,,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,1,no
Lufthansa customer review,8,Riccardo Innocenti,16th May 2014,We have a good flight with Lufthansa. The staff was nice and entertainment good. We found some film in our native language. The only remark from my point of view is that on flight LH410 too many people ask the rice as hot food and when it will arrive my turn it has finished (should happen) but the staff remember at the second time to serve me first.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,7,K Siegers,16th May 2014,Seat and display were not clean. The seat was very uncomfortable and even if I am only of average height there was not even enough space to cross or uncross my legs. I could not move around at all. Unfortunately catching some sleep under these conditions was not possible at all which is really bad for an overnight flight from Boston to Munich. Also the restroom was in really bad condition (thanks to fellow travelers who obviously do not know the basic rules of etiquette) I liked the touch screen of the inflight entertainment system which responded really well and delivered really good picture quality and the staff was really friendly as always.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,,3,yes
Lufthansa customer review,7,T Verhaeghe,13th May 2014,Brussels-Munich-Seoul. First flight excellent. Surprised to get a sandwich coke and tea on such a short flight. FA's very friendly. Munich to Seoul on the A340-600. Plane pretty old but well kept. Food was good: hot dinner and hot breakfast. Some FA's very friendly some pretty robotic. Poor entertainment system but still good enough to get me through the flight. Excellent value for money.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,6,Jefferson Ingrid,13th May 2014,LH414 May 10 2014. The flight was ok but here are some comments: Seat is not as comfortable as United Airlines. I liked that the amenity kit was event specific (soccer world championship). Many seats were empty in business class but I had a neighbour. The entertainment system is better now but there is still room for improvement. Too many old movies.,,,Business Class,,,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,,3,yes

Lufthansa customer review,10,Markus Reithwiesner,12th May 2014,"LH419 May 7. Enjoyed the new First Class: Food Service and Amenities were excellent like the new seat more than the ""private cabin"" approaches of some Arab or Asian airlines.

Lufthansa customer review,9,F Bertoni,12th May 2014,Just flew Munich - Sao Paulo on a A340-600. Flight was packed. Very attentive and nice cabin crew: I did ask for a sleeping mask was told it is meant for business class passengers. But I got one delivered 3 minutes later: very nice touch. Cabin crew almost all young men kept asking passengers if everything was fine. Food quality ok nothing special. Selection of movies on the IFE good but have seen better. The worst thing on this A346 was the seat: way too narrow to have some good sleep on this 12.50 hrs trip. Overall Lufthansa is still my number one choice when flying throughout Europe or to US/South America.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,5,Goran Stevanovic,12th May 2014,The flight was 3 legs: flight from Tampa FL to Belgrade Serbia. These flights were operated by United (Tampa to Washington DC) and 2 flights on Lufthansa. Even though the system on both Lufthansa and United showed that I could do an online check-in within 24 hours of the first flight and select seats - I was not able to do so. Systems are just not connected even they market this as a Star Alliance. It is a shame that it is not possible to choose seats online and that systems are not connected within the alliance.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,3,yes
Lufthansa customer review,6,Simon Summers,12th May 2014,VIE-FRA-HKG Business Class on an A321 then top deck on the new 747-800 with new business class seats. All flights on time. First leg acceptable although no IFE/moving map and food service was merely a tray of small but tasty canapes. On the flight to HKG must say that the new business class seats are very narrow and not particularly comfortable to sleep in. There's also no privacy screen between seats. Meals were acceptable although on both occasions my first choice was not available which I found strange being in the middle of a half-empty cabin. Service is functional/automated not very warm and cabin crew didn't appear happy to serve unlike SIA/Emirate/others. The IFE monitors were not sharp high resolution like onboard new Austrian business class. All in all would rate 6/10. Don't expect anything special it's not 4* service. LH's strengths are VFM and reliability so you can count on getting from A-B on time and a reasonable price if not in luxury.,,,Business Class,,,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,,3,no
Lufthansa customer review,8,Ansorge Michael,11th May 2014,LH 457 LAX-FRA: The design of the new Lufthansa first class (Boeing 747-800) is very good and the service was excellent. High quality standards!,,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,3,yes

Lufthansa customer review,10,D Kusiak,11th May 2014,Third return flight with LH First Class product. This time MUC-EWR on board A 340-600 and back on 747-400 EWR- FRA. LH First Class is absolute perfection. From ground staff through flight service to after touch down. It's a completely different way of air travel. It's expensive of course but you know exactly what you're paying for. Besides that it's even better when First Class is an upgrade.,,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,2,John Clark,11th May 2014,We were scheduled to fly out of SFO on April 3rd UA1169. Then to Addis Ababa on April 4th: LH419. Unfortunately we were not notified of the pilots strike until Wednesday afternoon April 2nd. We went to the SFO airport on April 2nd and were unable to obtain alternate flights that day. After several hours Lufthansa scheduled us to go through Seoul Hong Kong and on to Addis. However in the arrangement the last leg of our return flight on May 3rd had been deleted from the Lufthansa reservation list. The flight out of Addis LH 599 was 2 hours late leaving (no explanation given) which meant we had to run through the terminal in Frankfurt to catch the flight to Los Angeles. That flight left and arrived on time. Then we found we had no reservation from LAX to FAT. It was not a good experience! I have flown Lufthansa for 40 years and will continue to do so however this trip was not good for us.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,2,M Wu,11th May 2014,On a direct flight Munich to Los Angeles I found myself in row 39 (economy class) of an aircraft with a downstairs bathroom area. The bathroom configuration is a great innovation but next to my seat loomed the very imposing cover for the stairway to the bathroom. Mine was the inside seat of only two in that row because of the stairway. My elbow bumped into the stairway wall and my vision was totally blocked on that side. Claustrophobic alley! A kind attendant was able to reseat me. Meals? The plane departed at noon and lunch was served at 1 pm. Lufthansa has been touted for its meals and I was looking forward to this part. The meal itself was good from my experience with airplane food. A few hours later an attendant passed out Toblerone chocolate bars. Several hours after that more chocolate bars. Mind you this was a direct flight. It landed 12 hours after it departed. The passengers had last eaten a meal 11 hours earlier! I think most people would need at least a sandwich or light meal in that 11-hour period. There were no meals for purchase on board no help in sight. I think Lufthansa definitely needs to look carefully at their meal policy for such extended flights. If I ever travel on this airline again I'm bringing my own food!,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,,3,no
Lufthansa customer review,8,Lautwein Christof,10th May 2014,DUS-EWR. Lufthansa has improved many things in the past which was also more than necessary nothing to complain on this flight crew was also unusual friendly. The new business class seats are another big improvement. Not yet top-class but I was quite happy with everything.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,,3,yes

Lufthansa customer review,7,Adam Heinz-Hermann,7th May 2014,LH456 on May 4. This was a standard Trip on Lufthansa's Boeing 747-8i and the exit row window seats in economy are almost perfect for a daytime intercontinental flight. The entertainment systems performance was a little sluggish first but recovered the longer I used it. Food was OK for Economy service was as you expect from Lufthansa. As a premium customer you get individually greeted here and they even offered to bring a round of premium drinks from the Business class selection. The only pain point was that one of the lavatories was broken so the lines were bothersome all the time. I wonder why such a Premium plane does not get fixed before heading from FRA to LAX.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,3,yes
Lufthansa customer review,6,Ferrante Enrico,7th May 2014,LH410 3rd May 2014. Good quality and price unfortunately the temperature of the cabin was too low. Several passengers required to increase the temperature to the crew without satisfaction. Low rating for seat comfort is related to this reason.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,2,Ken Davis,6th May 2014,FRA-IAH on 4/14 diverted to DFW due to weather problems in Houston. Arrived DFW around 4 pm was told only option was to take their chartered buses which did not depart until around 10 pm and arrived IAH around 0230. I understand the weather issue but my issue is with the compulsory bus ride when there are multiple flights between DFW and IAH. Why was another flight not an option?,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,2,yes
Lufthansa customer review,10,J Lynch,6th May 2014,We had two flights in business class from Malaga to Dusseldorf and then to Heathrow. The flights were what we always have (and expect) with Lufthansa. Flights are on time boarded efficiently smiling staff tasty food and a nice sized chocolate treat. Some of the passengers are grumpy and impatient. The staff from Dusseldorf to Heathrow April 12 were some of the best we've encountered. A great sense of humor. No inflight entertainment but there isn't on any of the short flights we've seen in Europe.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,9,Lech Jan,6th May 2014,I was travelling from FRA to ORD in economy class on board 747-8.

So we had good and smooth trip. Satisfied.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,8,Hedin Joakim,5th May 2014,Went First Class FRA-MIA on the A380 21st April. Excellent service on all levels. Comfortable seats low cabin noise - very pleasant trip. Went Washington - FRA on 26th on the new 747-800. A not so pleasant flight. It took two hours to get the inflight entertainment system to restart but service was good otherwise and the same type of seat in the A380. My preference although is the 747-400 with the first Class on the upper deck - much more space and more quiet.,,,First Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,3,yes
Lufthansa customer review,9,Brandt Sebastian Justus,5th May 2014,Several flights in April: Rome via Munich to Sao Paulo and back from Rio de Janeiro via Frankfurt to Nice. All Lufthansa operated. Consistent quality on all flights: All on time (some ahead of schedule) very professional and courteous employees on board. I don't understand why their cabin crews have a reputation of being cold and robotic. Not true at all. Very service orientated. Seats improved on long haul flights. I liked the new inflight touch screens like an ipad - easy to use large and better variety of movies. Food as always very good departing from Germany and only average from Rio. But beverage service (also alcoholic) excellent nice snacks like Milka chocolate bars in the galleys throughout the flight. Airbus A340-600 much quieter and nicer to fly than even refurbished 747-400 back from Rio. Munich airport simply great to transfer. Frankfurt new Z-area a great plus. Baggage handling despite short connexion time good. Always arrived with us. A great way to fly very recommended!,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,7,G Ron,5th May 2014,YYZ-FRA-TLV on April 30. YYZ-FRA leg operated by an older 747-400 instead of the usual A340-600. Aircraft was refurbished and offered personal touch screens; seats were rather thin and uncomfortable for an 8 hour flight. I ordered a vegan (VGML) meal which included steamed vegetables and plain rice food was ok but lacked proteins and flavour dairy granola bar and margarine were provided which was annoying. Free beer wine and spirits were offered. Staff were courteous and professional. FRA-TLV leg was in a high density A321 seats were about 2 inches thick very hard and uncomfortable for the 4 hour flight. Food was surprisingly good and much better than the YYZ- FRA leg. No entertainment was offered. Service was extremely professional and courteous. Overall pretty satisfied and will definitely fly again.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,5,R Mahn,5th May 2014,LH 454 FRA-SFO 16 April 2014. LH 457 LAX-FRA 30 April 2014. Inflight entertainment and movie variety improved. Seat comfort is ok. No major difference to other airlines' economy. Staff service and friendliness is varying between employees. No consistency in friendliness and service. Food and beverage services take very long until guests are served. Breakfast is poor in terms of quantity content and quality. Just one additional beverage service after lunch/dinner. No sleeping masks provided.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,,2,no
Lufthansa customer review,10,Siddalingappa Siddaraju,5th May 2014,Departure LH 431 on April 16th and arrived LH 430 on May 2nd from Chicago O'Hare. Lufthansa had a Boeing 747 for this flight and it was great with individual TV’s for movie watching. Air hostesses had great attitudes and served with a smile. It was refreshing to see a good service throughout and made the long flight bearable. Only suggestion I would make is to provide more and better choices for movies. This is especially critical for long flights.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,7,Sirianni Carlo,5th May 2014,"LH 419 from IAD to FRA April 30th. Good Airline in terms of flight schedule and punctuality. Seats are not as comfortable as could be compared to other airlines mainly on intercontinental flights.

Lufthansa customer review,6,Mority von Laffert,3rd May 2014,May 2nd 2014 LH 413. Excellent cabin service. However I was unlucky in getting one of those ancient First Class cabins with seats which should be in a museum. I think it is unacceptable to offer such a First Class product when many Business class seats of other airlines are way better. The usual new FC is good though but the old one must be replaced.,,,First Class,,,1.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,,2,yes
Lufthansa customer review,8,M Connaughton,3rd May 2014,Flew MAN-FRA-BOG round trip last week. Overall was I was impressed with Lufthansa and would fly with them again. IFE is good if a little dated. FA's are very professional courteous and friendly. They were helpful with every request that I or other pax around me had. The aircraft (B737 A346 and A320) were clean. I opted for the vegetarian meals and was impressed with taste and quality. My only gripe is the seat pitch in economy. Thankfully I had a spare seat next to me on FRA-BOG outbound otherwise it does feel a bit cramped for a 180cm person like myself. I would travel with Lufthansa again.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,10,M Kleine,3rd May 2014,ABZ-FRA-TXL on 737-500 and A320. Lufthansa clearly stands out on European routes for me. 1) All classes include checked luggage and they are generous when it comes to weight limits (I had 28 kg no problem whatsoever). 2) Very generous bar service even between FRA and TXL (50 min flight time) they served drinks twice. There is always a snack and on international routes a proper sandwich which makes a difference with for example BA or Air France where they still serve lousy crackers on international (European) services. 3) The cabin crew are lovely has humour and also treats Economy Customers as important guests.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,9,R Wintrob,1st May 2014,My wife and I took Lufthansa flights BOS-MUC-DRS on Apr 18 DRS-MUC-GDN Apr 22 and GDN-MUC-BOS on Apr 28. We were very satisfied with the service. All flights were on schedule. Our return flight to BOS arrived early. The check- in procedure was courteous helpful and efficient. Our interactions with all flight attendants was courteous and helpful. We feel safe and confident about flying Lufthansa and would gladly do so in future.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,4,Kustermann Hubert,1st May 2014,Very positive experience. Only one major complaint: the distance between the rows of seats is very short. I am only 175 cm tall and weigh 65 kg but feel cramped in when the seat in front me is being reclined back I have no choice other than also tilt my seat back - even if I don't want to. Most other airlines provide better seating arrangements than I experienced on the flight LH 476 on April 28 2014.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,3,yes
Lufthansa customer review,7,Werhan Peter,1st May 2014,IAD-FRA LH 419 20/4/2014. New 747-8 reduction of engine noise - good. Seating - in view of economy class - good. Meals - breakfast lousy.

Lufthansa customer review,7,Wolf David,30th April 2014,LH456 and LH9242 on 10 April. Good product and Service - Shared flight with United Airlines was awful (not a thing I was looking for as I booked Lufthansa). Employees were most of the times quite nice. In-Seat-Entertainment in 747-800 works horribly (touch screen). Planes are cleaner than others from other airlines but still somewhat dirty - cleaning should do a better job and crew must check it prior to boarding.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,,3,yes

System needed to get re-started 4 times during the flight then adjusted manually. Food: salad was unenjoyable. Main course (beef fillet) looked very good but was tasteless. Service onboard not first class at all. Slow and not attentive. Lounge LAX: great facilities. However very thin food offering. Business flight outbound: Entertainment system crashed 3 times.

Lufthansa customer review,8,Ralf Bostedt,28th April 2014,LH 415 IAD-MUC on April 21 2014. This flight offered the cabin service as it used to be with friendly and attentive flight attendants which created a nice relaxing atmosphere. The inflight system was new and worked very well especially when comparing to the e.g. A380 (eco) which are terrible. Flight was very good however it all depends on the crew. I also experienced very bad and disinterested service (lately LH 462 A380 FRA-MIA on April 13 with unclean toilets right from the start and stressed personnel).,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,7,R Deu,25th April 2014,FRA-BCN 22 April Economy award ticket. This was an expensive (paying with miles) ticket from LJU to BCN. The first flight was on Adria and its new CRJ900 aircraft. FRA-BCN was on LH economy departure 4 mins before time bearding with 2 jetways to A321 which is very rare. Cabin crew were just regular. No special attention towards top tiers full flight basic food which included a small sandwich and a drink. Well groomed staff and maintained aircraft. Arrived (touched down) in BCN 6 mins ahead of schedule but lost 20 mins due to taxi and outside parking position even if a lot of gates were empty. Lufthansa is keeping itself above water saving even where savings are impossible charging more for taxes and lowering earning levels of Miles & More. After 25 years and complete dedication to LH I will not re-qualify for Gold status anymore.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,,3,yes
Lufthansa customer review,8,Emily Borowski,24th April 2014,I flew flight 434 from Munich to Chicago (ORD) on their A340. The plane was new beautiful and the flight attendants were pleasant. I had the chicken with rice meal option and it was good. I enjoyed the white wine and the staff was very good about keeping the passengers' glasses filled with water juice or soft drinks. I had the calzone instead of the quiche for the snack prior to landing. It was only okay and I was disappointed that a fork and a knife were not offered with this option. The IFE (in-flight entertainment) options were adequate. During the flight I watched two movies and enjoyed the spa/relaxing music option. To summarize I had a good experience and believe I got good value for my money. I would recommend Lufthansa.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,7,H Muellerschoen,23rd April 2014,It has been a long-haul transatlantic flight in a new 747-8. The baggage drop security check flight and arrival have been uneventful and ok. The service onboard was good but not outstanding. After less than ten rows serviced the choice of meals was already reduced to one (pasta). The quality is comparable to supermarket convenience food and tends to be lower than in previous years - in variety as well as in general quality.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,,3,yes
Lufthansa customer review,7,Simeone Enrique,22nd April 2014,HND-BRU via MUC 1st class A340-6 full plane in all classes. I am fond of LH but although very convenient HND airport check in was a mess even for 1st class had to wait more than 15 min computer problems staff lacking skills! Used ANA Suite Lounge - excellent! Boarding again messy. Once on board very efficient staff and professional purser. Food not so good and drinks very average. Since it was a day flight sleeping is difficult so watched a few movies and slept a little. Because the connecting time to the BRU flight was tight checked with purser and he assured me that someone was meeting me to go through all fast channels (ie passport control and security) but no one around made it on my own just before closing doors. Purser in short haul flight was apologetic as was check in gate staff. Excuses excuses and more excuses. All in all have the best European First class together with Swiss.,,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,,3,yes
Lufthansa customer review,8,Jose Antonio Pellicer,22nd April 2014,LH 1147 Bilbao - Frankfurt March 31st 2014. LH 440 Frankfurt - Houston March 31st 2014. LH 419 Washington Dulles - Frankfurt April 11th 2014. LH 1142 Frankfurt - Bilbao April 12th 2014. Overall I have to say that I am satisfied with the airline. Lufthansa makes you feel comfortable on most of their trips. I value the professionalism of its workers. The only two issues they should get better are the entertainment onboard in economy class where you find fewer movies compared to other airlines and the new calculations for the mileage system in 2014 which makes it more difficult to retain or gain frequent flyer or senator status unless you spend more money.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,8,Karl Moosbrugger,21st April 2014,FRA-SEA in business. Check-in was quick onboard a friendly crew and good service with tasty meal a snack half way and a warm snack before arrival. The new video system offered lots of choices. Seat was comfortable although I had the feeling they reduced the width compared to the old business seats.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,1,Bud Dungan,21st April 2014,I flew business class on A319 from Frankfurt to Erbil and back then to Houston on A380. There was no business seats from FRA to EBL even though they passed it off as business class. Just the same as coach. It was a 4 hour flight. Absolutely dreadful! Then in business class on the A380 the seats do not go horizontal therefore I could get no sleep as my body was being pulled down.,,,Business Class,,,1.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,,3,no

Lufthansa customer review,6,J Braun,19th April 2014,FRA-SIN-FRA on A380 in economy. Flight was cheap left/arrived on time and meals were fine but those were the only real positives. Fortunate to snag a seat with no seat in front so endless legroom. All other seats in economy looked ridiculously cramped. Seat itself was extremely uncomfortable for the 12 hour flight and the constant prodding of the touch screen from the passenger behind is a little annoying. (Unfortunately this is the only way to operate the screen as the remote is basically useless) Entertainment system would have been ok but crashed 3 times. Am Lufthansa 'Senator' status which helped in being able to secure one of the best seats (53D) other than that absolutely no recognition of so called status on board unlike Air New Zealand where one feels welcome pampered and valued - even though it is not my 'home' airline. All in all pretty sad for such a proud airline.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,,3,no
Lufthansa customer review,8,D Norton,19th April 2014,Madrid to Bogota via Frankfurt. Excellent flight to FRA with good hot breakfast of Spanish omelette and spinach bread and jam with plenty of drinks! Upgraded to business class with my partner using miles. Only issue I have with Lufthansa was the transfer to Terminal C which includes having to exit and go through security once again which is always slow at FRA airport. Senator lounge in C very nice and cosy with direct door access to the gates. Service onboard to Bogota was excellent despite my food choice not being available even third row into the business class. The food portions are smaller but the drinks service made up for that with the crew members being super nice and efficient. I have always enjoyed Lufthansa since 15 years in general but the new miles and status earning system is somewhat disappointing but perhaps necessary with the overcrowded lounges and lack of free seats when using miles.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,8,Fischer Felix,16th April 2014,LH1233 on 16th of April from Vienna to Frankfurt. The overall flight was good and the flight attendants were friendly. We also got a small snack. The fact that there was absolutely no Inflight Entertainment was no problem due to the short flying time. The only things which disturbed me were that the flight was overbooked and that the online check-in didn't worked till I called the Lufthansa hotline. But all in all I would recommend Lufthansa and look forward for the next flight!,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,8,B Mock,16th April 2014,Frankfurt to Dulles International Airport Washington DC on 13 April - even in economy class. It was such a contrast to the miserable United flight a week before - without doubt the most excruciatingly cramped and uncomfortable flight I have experienced. Seats on Lufthansa were very comfortable and crew outstanding with well- timed efficient food and beverage service. Loved the hot towel service! Only drawback was the frustrating in- flight entertainment system with sluggish touch screens requiring multiple attempts to activate and many movie selections which would not play. The seats were such an improvement over United's that I intend to fly Lufthansa whenever possible from now on even tho' I am a United Mileage Plus member.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,8,L Hausmann,16th April 2014,LH 418 on 9th April 2014. I was very satisfied with the overall experience on my Lufthansa flight although I would hope for a few additional movies on the inflight entertainment recent releases in particular. Staff were friendly and meal choices okay. Sometimes offers e.g. for Bailey's/Cognac after meals are only made upon request so you need to pay close attention when a flight attendant comes by. However compared to other airlines I've travelled with so far (e.g. Air France UA US Airways KLM Air Berlin) I'd rate Lufthansa higher than average.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,4,yes

Lufthansa customer review,9,Robert Renshaw,13th April 2014,My first experience with Lufthansa was outstanding. I expect superior service in business or first class and I expect adequate service in coach/economy the Lufthansa staff from IAH-FRA and FRA-DXB (and back) were extremely pleasant and helpful - with a full cabin they were able to top-level service. I was pleasantly surprised that they maintained their pace for so long. The food was certainly better than most economy fare and the in-flight entertainment provided more than enough options to keep me occupied for nearly 40 hours of flight time on my round trip. I have come to expect average service when booking coach/economy and Lufthansa significantly raised the bar in this area. Now that I know about them first-hand I will look for their flights first when I travel.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,1,Idra Thernot,13th April 2014,8 April 14 LH 008 HAM-FRA. Packed flight. Deadheading stewardess decides to dump her 2 (sizeable) pieces of luggage in the overhead bins above the emergency exits instead of taking her stuff to the back of the plane. Result: No space for paying passengers' luggage legroom can't be used (naturally) working stewardess had to rearrange a bunch of bags and coats and spread them throughout the airplane.

Lufthansa customer review,7,Roberts David,13th April 2014,Brussels to Frankfurt business class March 25. Checked in at Zaventem at the First/Business Class counter with the most miserable agent I have encountered in 30 years of flying.

Lufthansa customer review,7,Dago Didier,11th April 2014,LH418 on April 8. Overall trip was good - given the seat I had. Staff service was okay - although some more smiles would have been welcomed. Appreciated personal and named greetings from the chef de cabine coming to the Economy section - thanks to my M&M status. Food was okay. Could have been more appealing for the snack 2hrs before landing. A hot napkin before landing would be a plus.

I'm very pleased with Lufthansa.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,6,A Pagan,10th April 2014,HND-MUC-ATH on A346. 24 hours before I checked in on a seat on emergency exit. I was surprised to find out that they had a different lay out so no extra leg room. Thankfully economy section 30% full so I jumped in the seat in front of the bulk. The seat was quite comfortable. Food and beverages quite good. On time performance. Now on the below par section. The cabin was extremely cold and the blankets were small and thin. Complaints made but nothing changed. IFE a bit old without remote control tough to navigate on a low resolution screen. A worn out touch screen with ok variety on movies though. Poor audio and the headsets completely useless. Cabin crew quite the opposite of ANA crew on my inbound FRA-HND. Actually robotic. No smiles no interaction. They served lunch 30 minutes after take off and then disappeared. Only one of them seated in the galley area with a tray of water and juice on a self service mode. After 9 hours they served a dinner box (again as in lunch there was a choice between Japanese and Western). Priority on my luggage was not honored in Athens as my suitcase came out after 20 minutes waiting on the carousel. All in all a below par flight from LH.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,,3,yes
Lufthansa customer review,8,P Kreft,10th April 2014,"In the past years I have flown with Lufthansa mostly to collect miles but this year they reduced the miles for low fare economy flights from 50% to 25%! Why on earth would I still choose LH? Singapore Airlines has better service much better food more comfortable seats and same or often lower prices than LH. British Airways as well. Who was the genius to introduce this new ""saving"" policy at LH? Anyway they did not give much miles away. I feel like being punished because in the past I chose LH over other carriers.",,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,,4,yes

LH760 Frankfurt to New Delhi 24th Feb 2014. Good leg room great food above average service and a hygienic environment. The in-flight entertainment was quite a let down. All in all a brilliant airline. One of the best in Europe but no where near the Top 3 Airlines like: Singapore Airlines Qatar and Emirates. But probably one of the best Transatlantic Flights out there especially when travelling from India.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,4,Robert von Herrmann,6th April 2014,I am shocked that LH is planning to do away with the Senator benefit of being able to reserve seating at time of booking. I need an emergency exit seat as I am very tall and LH has had my loyalty for the last 14 years expressly because of this reason. If they allow anyone to reserve the emergency exit seats at any time then why should a passenger remain loyal.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,,2,no
Lufthansa customer review,7,Thomas Hilbert,2nd April 2014,"CCS-FRA-TXL and return aboard LH FirstClass in March. Inbound flight was excellent A330-300 with new FC. Check in in CCS was a 5 min thing very efficient and friendly. In CCS they use the AA Admirals Club for FirstClass lounge which was average limited drink selection no food not even snacks. Boarding was fast. Crew were nice and caring Seat was comfy but not as comfy as it looks. It's a lie flat where they put a ""mattress"" on but still quite hard to lie on but at least you can stretch out. Food was good but not outstanding. Transit in FRA is a mess CCS flights always got remote parking no gate! You have to climb off the plane get into Van take a 15min ride to Arrivals B then walk 30+ mins through Immigration customs on to Departures A. Senator Lounge at A Gates is like a luxury hotel full breakfast buffet smoking lounge showers full bar and great service. FRA-TXL leg is only 50 mins they put you in Business in lack of a First in these flights. Return flight was scheduled for March 27 but cancelled due to strike. They rescheduled my flight on the phone for March 28 no problem. TXL-FRA left at 6 am on time. Getting from Arrivals A to Departure C in FRA is disgusting. Endless walking (40+ mins) plus a trip on a train for people with moving limitations almost impossible to handle. Senator Lounge at C Gates very good but not as splendid as the one at A Gates I mentioned before. FRA-CCS decent service same food experience ( same menu) same good vodka same "" so-so"" seats. Nice inflight entertainment with large flatscreen good selection of actual movies and TV series. On time arrival in CCS very fast bag service with FirstClass bags unloaded first. Nice experience but not worth the money due to seats and food quality.",,,First Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,2,yes
Lufthansa customer review,10,Juergens Franz,2nd April 2014,LH 1770 29/3/2014. Two days ago I returned from Istanbul to Frankfurt and this was an example for what has become again standard. Plane was completely full passengers were greeted at the entrance door. Friendly and highly professional was the attitude of the 5 flight attendants. Meal service consisted of a warm dish (chicken with vegetables and wedges) a roll with butter rice pudding and a small bottle of water followed by two rounds of drinks. LH still has one of the most generous choices of free drinks non-alcoholic of any kind plus red and white wine sparkling wine beer etc. Announcements from the cockpit were short clear and informative. The cabin design was okay and clean. Due to the thin recaro seats space is sufficient even for larger people. Lufthansa is definitely on the rise again.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,1,P Frutiger,1st April 2014,I was supposed to fly LAX-FRA-BLQ on April 2nd. Due to the pilot strike the flight was cancelled. After over one hour on the phone with the representative I was offered a free of charge rebooking for April 4th ironically the 3rd day of a well pre-planned strike. The representative knew less about the strike and the cancelled flights than I did! After that useless option was given I was offered a seat on the 5th which unfortunately by this time was making the entire trip pointless. I asked for a refund LH declined even if they failed to deliver their part of the transaction.

Other than for the unfortunate strikes which delayed my original flight plan I found the ground personnel and the flight personnel always helpful polite and very professional. I also appreciated having been warned at least 48 hours ahead of time regarding the strike. It gave me enough time to reschedule and change my itinerary.

Lufthansa customer review,6,Dirk Toebben,31st March 2014,My preferred airline to keep my status (SEN). I like the fact that they welcome to you personally aboard as a senator. This was not done on this trip however. The next space in the economy is not all that great but that is probably true for most deadlines. What I do not like about Lufthansa is that they have greatly reduce their miles earnings on certain flights as of this year. If my chances to renew my status were further reduced I would probably look into other airlines more often as well. On this trip I had a nice seat in the exit row. Unfortunately I had a huge guy sitting next to me so it was all cramped in anyway. In addition the baby across the aisle cried the entire night however these are not Lufthansa's fault of course. The flight was on time even 20 minutes early.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,,3,yes

Lufthansa customer review,9,Roger Tyler,30th March 2014,"LH754 FRA-BLR. 747-400. Excellent flight. Clean and comfortable cabin. Delightful service with a crew that actually cared about your level of comfort and needs. Food was way above standard for most mainline airlines. This was a second sector flowing on from a UAL connecting flight. The comparisons are beyond explaining. The UAL plane was a 777-200 ER. It was old dirty and basically a disgrace. The crew were in their old United way ""Perfunctory"". They had a job to do. Do it and get the passengers out of their hair. Hence when I look upon LH it is in direct comparison to the former flight. Where LH lost my vote was in baggage. They went on strike in FRA and my bags took two days to locate. The attempts to get it to me were lacking to say the least.",,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5,yes

On the flight out the aircraft was clean but the seats were very hard and on the flight out the staff had a poor level of English (no manners). The worst part was the new inflight system the touch screen was poor at responding to input on both flights. Regarding food they only had pasta left by the time they had reached us.

Lufthansa customer review,6,C Schmidt,26th March 2014,LH431. Seats are terrible - the person behind you only has to touch your seat and it feels like a punch in the back. In addition when the person in front of you decides to use the reclining function it's almost impossible to move or get out of your seat.

Lufthansa customer review,1,M Duitsman,26th March 2014,My 9.30 LH309 flight on 23/3/2014 out of Florence Italy was cancelled due to rain. Only one Lufthansa representative was available to rebook the entire flight's customers. After retrieving our luggage waiting in a long line to rebook through your only available representative in Florence we were to board a bus to take us to Bologna leaving at 13.00. It actually left at 14.15. No representative guided us with instructions on which bus to get on. When we arrived in Bologna one Lufthansa representative said to get into Line 35. When we approached the Lufthansa representative at Line 35 she got annoyed that we were in the wrong line. When I pointed out the gentleman who told us to get in her line she grabbed my ticket and approached that man. She came back without my ticket and told us we couldn't check in until 2 hours before the flight. Finally I got out of line and approached the man showed him my passport to get my ticket back. The meal voucher we were given in Florence was not honored in Bologna. Finally we got our baggage checked and seats assigned in Bologna 2 hours before our flight. When we arrived in Frankfurt no representative was there to greet us and walk us to where we were to get hotel vouchers. The whole experience was awful. Stress levels could have been lessened if Lufthansa people were well-informed and actually gave us correct information and were there to actually meet us and show us where or what we had to do. Walking around the airports in Bologna and Frankfurt with luggage on a wild goose chase because Lufthansa representatives didn't have a clue or gave us misdirection's was very bad mismanagement of customers and very poor customer service. I understand they cannot control the weather but Lufthansa CAN control the information given to customers after a cancellation and actually have representatives in place to guide us at each airport.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,3,no

I was sitting in the rear part of the aircraft on the window side. The supplied blankets are completely ineffective because they are made of wide mesh kind of fabric that still lets the cold air pass through that is coming from the overhead ventilation slots. In the end I had to wear my winter jacket all the time.

Lufthansa customer review,10,Maximilian Pflaum,24th March 2014,I flew on the new 747-8 from IAD to FRA. The aircraft was amazingly comfortable and the seats in Economy are definitely an upgrade from previous LH Eco-seats. Service was great and staff very friendly. Only downside is the PTV this is very slow and therefore can be annoying after a while. All in all this was a great experience.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,8,Jon Popa,24th March 2014,LH438. Flight and cabin service very good. Attendants very courteous and attentive. Food quality and selection seem to be downgraded from previous flights. Seat too small and uncomfortable (I am a small person). Space between seat in front very tight.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,7,Jon Popa,24th March 2014,LH439. Flight and Service very good. Food quality and selection not so good. Seats much too small. Seat in front reclined much too far. Had to request passenger in front to adjust the seat forward so that I could eat and even get out of the seat during flight.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,7,Annegret Borrmann,24th March 2014,Flying from the US I always would prefer a non-US Airline. I have been flying LH for quite some time but service and especially food has deteriorated. Since we prefer Airbus instead of flying Boeing we always used the connection via Munich. Maybe next time we will try either KLM or Air France provided we can chose those airlines both ways. We experienced the US airlines with very low standard: service/food/and seating.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,,3,yes
Lufthansa customer review,4,Tambe Suhas,22nd March 2014,2nd Mar 2014 LH 431 Chicago - Frankfurt. 3rd Mar 2014 LH 760 Frankfurt - Delhi. 17th Mar 2014 LH 761 Delhi - Frankfurt. 17th Mar 2014 LH 430 Frankfurt - Chicago. A pleasant surprise on the flight was the availability of power outlets everywhere. But there were no seats with greater legroom I was ready to pay for. Other things were good as usual including the ever-smiling and helpful cabin crew. One suggestion though. Please stop further cutting corners on food to save costs. The snack pack is so thin already. Finally still waiting to hear about a Special Class between Business and Economy.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,,3,yes
Lufthansa customer review,7,J Singh,22nd March 2014,LH from ATL to FRA. Recaro business class seats on the A340 are not full lie flats but are still very comfortable. Dinner was surprisingly delicious and service was efficient yet not intrusive typically German I suppose. Major negative was the IFE screen which were small and washed out better to use my mobile phone than waste time with this relic from the 90's.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,,2,yes
Lufthansa customer review,7,Rainer Macherey,21st March 2014,LH430 FRA-ORD on March 15th. Flynet was again not working. Toilets were awful after a few hours. Service personnel were very friendly. Water was dripping out of the A/C overhead after takeoff and before landing.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,8,R Moessner,21st March 2014,ORD-MUC: Flight left on time staff nice as always. Food could be better. Beverage Service and hot towels are just good. Overall good experience for a pretty good Price. Would do it again.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,10,A Kearney,21st March 2014,LH2482 MUC-LHR. First time flying with Lufthansa and very impressed. Flight was on time cabin crew attentive and good inflight service (bar service tea/coffee and tasty sandwiches provided) - significantly better than that offered on most short haul European flights. Would definitely use again.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,0.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,4,V Donnelly,21st March 2014,Even with high class tickets very poor mileage accrual in comparison to competing airlines. A340 new aircraft seats recline too much. Makes it impossible to work on laptop or exit your seat without asking the person in front to please go forward. This makes the flight terribly uncomfortable. Food is really quite poor. However I fly a lot with LH and the staff are always lovely. No shortage of beverages and smiles. Wide network and travel through good hubs. The lounges can vary some good some not so good. Overall if they stopped putting such a recline on seats and matched competitors on mileage gain it would be a lot better.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,,3,yes
Lufthansa customer review,9,M Wagner,21st March 2014,LH 424 from Munich to Boston. Ground service good and fast Business lounge in Munich (with frequent flyer status) good but pretty packed. A330 in 2x4x2 Economy configuration and plane was packed to nearly the last seat. Despite this the cabin crew got 5 rounds of drink-service done after the main meal impressive and efficient. They were also very attentive and friendly. A negative point for Lufthansa's extreme cost cutting program as on both meals no choice available always only a single meal available which feels poor for an Airline with a claim of being a premium carrier.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,8,K Ludewig,21st March 2014,13/3/2014 LH 490. Nice and comfortable flight from Frankfurt to Seattle with a 3 seat row for myself.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,7,A Kusnierczak,18th March 2014,Bangkok - Kuala Lumpur onboard Boeing 747-400. Flight was very nice comfortable and on time. Lufthansa should consider improving their IFE which works very slowly. It would be nice to receive more than just one sandwich. The was flight was nice comfortable and price was very affordable.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,9,Kraebber Sharon,18th March 2014,First rate flight New 747-8 from Chicago to Frankfurt roomy seats even in Economy. Food quantity and quality has decreased. Beverage and hot towels service still rates high!,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,5,M Montagna,18th March 2014,Flight LH457 LAX-FRA First class. First class is a luxury. However some problems on the ground: The attendant at LAX lounge forgot to collect all the passengers when the flight was announced. Considering that the flight took off with a 1.5 hr delay and the transit time was 1h 45mins I expected some info from the cabin personnel about the feasibility to catch the next flight but nobody was able to give me an answer even though the question was put to them several times. I thought there would be somebody to meet me at the exit to bring me to the next flight nobody was there.,,,First Class,,,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,8,Anistratenko Oxana,18th March 2014,Feb 22 LH 2531 LH 452. March 8 UA 1207 LH 431. March 9 LH 1444. I've been using this airline for almost 10 years now both for flights within Europe and for Transcontinental ones. I'm generally happy with the service the food is always good even in the economy class. Flight attendants are generally very nice and often seem to be happy with what they're doing.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,4,C McAndrew,17th March 2014,LH575 from Cape Town to Munich on Monday 10th March. Disappointed with overall service provided compared to price paid. Poor inflight entertainment drinks offered were few and far between and meals average at best.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,,2,yes
Lufthansa customer review,10,Dimitrios Simeonidis,17th March 2014,SKG-MUC A3 500. MUC-JFK LH 410. JFK-MUC LH 411. MUC-SKG A3 501. Lufthansa is the airline that me and my family members have been using in the last 20 years. I have been a member of the Senator Club as well. We prefer LH for obvious reasons such as security good service in air and on the ground kind and experienced personnel. Fleet with new and well maintained airplanes. In short Lufthansa satisfies most if not all requirements of most passengers.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,10,Shiva Prasad,17th March 2014,Travelled to India from Orlando (MCM) via Frankfurt on Feb 23 2014. It was a great experience. The front desk supervisors on that day helped me a lot and the flight attendants were good onboard. Overall it was a very pleasant journey.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,8,Stefan Johansson,17th March 2014,LH415 IAD-MUC. It's generally good. Food and leg space in economy is ok. What I didn't like this time was that they started to serve dinner at 23.40! We departed at 22.55.At that hour it should be dark and silent.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,5,Marlies Leist,17th March 2014,LH 429 CLT-MUC. Everybody was very friendly the only thing I did not like: I had a reservation for 2 seats (window/aisle) since last June. The day we took our flights (March 11th) we learned that our seats did not exist anymore and that we had new seats in the middle of a row of four! As we protested we got two new seats in the back of the airplane at least two seats on the aisle. Why did nobody tell us as soon as the reserved seats were not available anymore? I think Lufthansa should not treat customers like that.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,9,Michael Kasberg,13th March 2014,FRA-BKK v.v. First fully booked on both flights so the service was a bit slow. A340-600 with old seats but comfortable enough for a good sleep. F&B excellent with caviar service and outstanding wines. IFE with not many options small TV screen. Two FA's very friendly but for 8 pax LH should deploy more staff. All flights on time overall good value for money. But I found out shortly that LH will not offer F to BKK any longer from summer onwards.,,,First Class,,,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,10,M Tushishvili,11th March 2014,The flight from Paris to Tbilisi via Munich. Both flights were just excellent. Very efficient check-in and boarding in Paris. Both aircraft's were very clean with informative updates from the pilot. Seats are actually very comfortable in comparison with low cost airlines. Paris-Tbilisi route offers excellent hot food (I had very tasty chicken) as well as the full bar service. One important fact which is important to highlight. I had short connection (45 minutes) in Munich and the plane departed half hour late from Paris. I thought that I would miss the plane to Tbilisi and the big surprise was that the ground staff was waiting for me and transferred from the plane to plane. This is excellent service and deep appreciation to Munich airport and Lufthansa ground staff!,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,10,Jon Pirtle,11th March 2014,Departure from Charlotte to MUC-VIE: 10 Dec 2013 on LH 428. Return from Vienna to Charlotte via MUC: 6 March 2014 on LH 429. I travel regularly between the USA and Europe and I choose Lufthansa every time if it is available. The airline is reliable and consistent. Their staff both on-board and on the ground are considerate and helpful.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,9,Martin Zitz,11th March 2014,Feb 23 LH412. Feb 28 LH429. Generally good service good planes well operated - Miles & More starts to become an issue. No general rewards hard to achieve status service drastically declines without status.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,10,M Proppe,11th March 2014,LH491 on 3 March. Very professional safe punctual and helpful. The Service on board was very good as always. I was very happy to be able to use FlyNet and send all my work to my office while travelling. Also connection time was very convenient allowing us time to refresh in FRA after intercontinental flight.,,,Premium Economy,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,9,J Ackermann,10th March 2014,TXL-FRA/FRA-TXL. Both flights on time nice staff high quality food which was nicely presented. LH's domestic business product is far better that the long-haul one. Flaws: no Wifi and IFE whatsoever.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,3,J Ackermann,10th March 2014,FRA-EZE/EZE-FRA. Flights on time staff pleasant. Old Business Class: seats a nightmare IFE problems on both flights FlyNet not working on any leg food appalling. No taking of orders. You get your courses from the food cart which stores loads of plates under aluminium foil lids. My companion got a VLML special meal main course on return flight: pasta with tomato sauce and cheese! Cheese stuck to the lid and was transferred on the pasta using a cocktail stirrer. Dessert: five slices of fruit served together with main course. White wine out of stock after starters. Service uncoordinated. It was a disgrace and I was ashamed for our German flag carrier.,,,Business Class,,,2.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,,2,no
Lufthansa customer review,8,Barnicoat Graham,10th March 2014,Flight LH419 Dulles Intl - Frankfurt Intl 25/3/2014. As I am part of the Miles & More programme I prefer to fly Lufthansa. On my last flight I was looked after well the flight left on time and landed early and I was able to choose a seat with extra leg room which is important for me.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,9,S Molling,7th March 2014,LH428 on 3/5/14. Great crew good meals provided as well as in-flight entertainment. The only thing I would add is that it would be extremely convenient to be able to pay for additional baggage on-line like other airlines do.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,3,yes
Lufthansa customer review,2,Gruendel Mike,7th March 2014,LH 411 2 March. My seat was in the first row on the aisle. Due to the service it was not possible to stretch my legs for a long period of time. After the flight I still had pain in my back. The onboard service was not very satisfying and the meal served was not really edible.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,,2,no
Lufthansa customer review,10,Wylezol Roman,7th March 2014,LH435 ORD-FRA. Very comfortable the highest standard of services on board. On time despite the snowy weather in Chicago. There was only one issue - prior to LH flight I flew from SLC to ORD (LH codeshare operated by United Airlines) - the worst quality I have experienced.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,7,C Barkei,6th March 2014,3 flights with Lufthansa inside Europe. All on time and reliable. Seat in Economy is quite firm but OK for a short period of time. I got bored of the sandwich after the first one but then got the identical one twice more so I gave it away. Staff were friendly and the coffee was good. The Senator lounge in Munich was excellent as were the lounges in Manchester and Luxembourg. No in-flight entertainment so bring a book or read the paper. A very solid product.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,,3,yes
Lufthansa customer review,10,Max Primorac,5th March 2014,Arriving to Washington DC Dulles Airport for my flight to Croatia via Frankfurt Airport I was offered special care due to a lower back injury that severely hampered my physical movement. From the US through Frankfurt Airport and upon arrival in Zagreb Croatia I was offered friendly transit support at each and every stage. I have made this flight over 100 times and despite the pain associated with my injury I must say that this was the most satisfying travel experience I have had in over 30 years of international travel.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,7,M Krafft,4th March 2014,LH 419 departure on Feb 27 2014. I flew with Lufthansa's new 747-8i. Nice clean and very new plane. I was seated in the main cabin in row 16 (first row in coach class). For an overnight flight it is recommendable to aim for a exit row seat since you cannot stretch your legs and the arm rests are firm. The meals and beverages/drinks provided were all very good and did meet my expectations. Getting on and off the plane was fast and efficient. All in all still a satisfactory experience.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,7,Arnold Sebastian,4th March 2014,LH464 from Frankfurt to Orlando in Business Class with our infant (12 weeks old). Check-in in Frankfurt for family's was very good due to extra check-in counter. Service onboard and the food was ok. Nice wine collection and space for my legs.,,,Business Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,7,S Redfern,4th March 2014,Flew return GIG-Tegel via Frankfurt. Check-in in Rio was a bit of a nightmare. A massive queue with no priority until got closer the desk. Took me over half an hour. Lounge in Rio did not have many options of drinks/food. The plane was an old A340 but it was well kept and the crew was very attentive. Food ok. Angled flat seats which are not very comfortable. Return leg was much different. Lounge in FRA quite good priority check in old A340 but excellent service and food.,,,Business Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,3,yes
Lufthansa customer review,8,J Menard,4th March 2014,Lufthansa flight 493 from Vancouver to Frankfurt on March 2nd 2014: I was impressed with Lufthansa's service in coach class. Tasty meals and a great variety of free beverages and snacks offered throughout the flight. Cabin staff was very cheerful and approaching even though it was a full flight with some quite challenging passengers around me.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,10,Adam Wang,4th March 2014,"LHR-MUN-PEK-FRA-LCY. My 5th London - Beijing flights with Lufthansa within 2 years and I have to say the quality is stable and consistent as well as good value for money. For both the outbound and inbound paths the flights are on time if not slightly early during the long haul flight several water runs during the night and the staff are the biggest assets providing the friendly efficient and professional services. During the flight between PEK and FRA the new Boeing 747-800 was used it offered the personal power socket and free WIFI onboard which is extremely good value. The only slight drawback is that you can not select seats on the exit rows online and airport check in as they are ""occupied"" however when on board you realised that half of them are empty.",,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,7,A Yong,3rd March 2014,SIN-FRA-BHX in Economy. First leg from Singapore on the A380 was great largely because I was fortunate enough to get an exit row seat with unlimited legroom (judging by fellow passengers one wouldn't be happy with normal seats as they had rather pathetic legroom). Nice modern AVOD system but the PTVs were rather small compared to other A380 airlines. Service was really friendly and warm but few frills (no amenity kit whatsoever no footrests). Meals were alright but again rather simple compared to Asian carriers. Second leg to Birmingham on an A320 was above average by intra-Europe standards with a decent snack/beverage service and friendly service again. All flights on time.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,,3,yes
Lufthansa customer review,3,Vukmanovic Goran,3rd March 2014,"Flights LH720 and LH721 from FRA to PEK and back. Everything written regarding the Lufthansa business class seats is absolutely true. Outbound flight on new 747-8 with new business class seats which are flat beds. Unfortunately if you are satt near the window in flat bad position it is almost impossible to get out of the ""bed"" without disturbing your co-passenger. On top your feet are very squeezed in the tiny hole at the bottom of the bed. Food choice OK as well as beverages. IFE system I would rate as average. Flight on time. Inbound flight - nightmare instead of 747-8 it was old 747-4. As I checked in online nobody at the counter mentioned that the plane was changed and consequently my seat. Departure late for more than an hour. Old business class seats which are a disaster if you have the idea to sleep during the flight (not flat bed and very uncomfortable). Entertainment system was not working for more than two hours of the flight as needed to be reset. Food on the same level as outbound flight. No soap in the toilette. At the end arrived on time to catch my connecting flight. Overall will use them only if I have to otherwise for the same or lower cost other ME airlines and even the airlines from the Lufthansa group are offering much more for the same buck.",,,Business Class,,,2.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,,2,no
Lufthansa customer review,7,Alexander Kunzle,3rd March 2014,LH457 LAX-FRA 26/2/2014. Service OK seats in new 747/8 are very bad with not enough space! Food was good beverage service not satisfying!,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,,4,no
Lufthansa customer review,7,Andreas Dietzel,3rd March 2014,The LH 411 flight from JFK to Munich was in total a very comfortable one. The service was much better than expected.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,9,Herman Mitzi,28th February 2014,Flight from Frankfurt to Singapore. Great value for money. Food was delicious. Inflight entertainment could be improved for instance a more modern and larger movie selection as on other competing airlines. Considering that the flight was 180 Euros cheaper than Singapore Airlines I was very satisfied.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,10,Carl Randem,26th February 2014,LH456 FRA-LAX 21 Feb 14. Great trip with LH new aircraft nice and enjoyable/humoristic crew. Nothing to say on the service although the seats do need an upgrade it does not contribute to the full experience as the entire flight overall is good. The entertainment system (AVOD) is easy to use although late responding but with a good selection of films music and travel information. Overall a very nice experience and flight.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,9,Lars Bjoerner,25th February 2014,EWR-MUC 19/02/2013 LH413. My travel experience was great. From check-in to lounge and boarding it was very smooth and easy. The flight itself was relaxing food and drink was excellent and the staff very friendly. In the end we were even 30 minutes ahead of schedule. I wish flying would always be like this experience.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,8,Philip van wegen-wirth,25th February 2014,"LH410. Not having much space these day in normal economy class with 6'6'"" height it is nice to know that is still possible to get the emergency exits. Service is good and very friendly.",,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,7,Claus Roth,25th February 2014,LH 428 on Feb 16 2014 from MUC to CLT. Flew First Class - very attentive friendly service. Insufficient movie selection in comparison to other airlines. Entertainment system often malfunctioning so in this case no service call or reading light activation possible.,,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,,2,yes
Lufthansa customer review,6,T Naver,25th February 2014,Disappointed with the recent Buenos Aires to Frankfurt flight. Several crew members seemed rude and unmotivated when an elderly lady boarded with a light and small suitcase the flight attendant refused to help her stow it away. Other occasions the crew were not helpful: to a family travelling with small children removing food plates instead they walked over it and complained about it. Other than that service was been ok flight attendants served passengers with water and juice several times during the night in addition to the self-service bar area with small snacks and beverages. Dinner was ok breakfast was very disappointing. Unfortunately there are not many alternatives on this route. However on the outbound journey the crew both on ground and on board were much nicer and all flights were on time.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,,3,no
Lufthansa customer review,9,Juraj Kovac,24th February 2014,Early-morning feeder flights from to Frankfurt and back outbound on a brand new A320 return on an older plane with newish cabin. The core product is rather basic both in terms of comfort and services but the planes were spotless the crews extremely professional and the slimline seats at least provide decent legroom. LH still serves nice breakfast and drinks even on these short hops and there is really nothing major to complain about. One thing to improve is seat assignment in economy which tends to get really messy at times.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,6,J Gensert,21st February 2014,Unfortunately we were unable to use the online check-in service on the Lufthansa homepage. This service is apparently unavailable when you have a connecting flight in Los Angeles (LAX to FRA) and come from the Big Island of Hawaii - Kona Airport for that matter - meaning that our 4 tickets were scattered all over the plane. Luckily this problem could easily be solved by a friendly member of the Lufthansa ground staff in LA. The flight from LA to Frankfurt was okay overall seats on the 747-8I are not the most uncomfortable though a little too lightly padded. Dinner and Breakfast were offered - both were quite good. The inflight entertainment featured some of the latest movies in various languages (sadly variety was not that great) the flight attendant were generally nice. We would recommend Lufthansa.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,10,A Davidson,20th February 2014,Feb 18 2014: Lufthansa - LH1817 - Barcelona (BCN) to Munich (MUC). This segment was part of a five flight itinerary with United Airlines a review of which can be found under their name. This particular Lufthansa experience was as always superbly efficient on the ground in both Barcelona and Munich. Navigating airports at either end was a breeze and the embarkation and disembarkation process easy and smooth. The flight itself had both an on-time departure and arrival and the in-flight service was as expected superb and efficient as one would expect from Lufthansa. Always a treat to fly with Lufthansa and will continue to do so whenever possible.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,8,P Spangenberg,20th February 2014,LH 410 MUC to JFK 1st Feb 2014. The flight was fully booked but it was ok. Crew very friendly. Since I was sitting at rear I had only one meal left to choose. The space for my feet was very limited because of some mounted housings under the seat in front. Too little space to place something like a bottle of water and a book. Plane was new and in good shape.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,9,Douitsis Athanasios,18th February 2014,LH431 from ORD to FRA. These long haul flights now have wifi which was a pleasant surprise. Apart from that the cabin was not particularly full which made it easy to put the bag under the seat next to me etc. I suspect the comfort would be diminished if it was otherwise. Apart from that no other surprises the food was good the staff polite the flight was on schedule.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,3,yes
Lufthansa customer review,8,Stella Nuti,18th February 2014,Flight 457 from Los Angeles to Frankfurt was delayed due a technical problem. Unfortunately there was no assistance for me at the arrival gate since my flight connection was half an hour later I had to rush pass again through the security check and immigration. I arrived breathless at the gate of my flight to Florence where we were told that they had to change the aircraft due to a technical problem. I had to wait for another hour. Concerning the service on board and the aircraft (a new B747-800) I have nothing to complain about.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,3,yes
Lufthansa customer review,3,Saketh Rahm,17th February 2014,ORD-FRA-DEL. A typical mixed bag of service. ORD-FRA was supposed to be on 747-8 and I booked this flight specifically for this aircraft but they downgraded to normal 747 in the last minute. This caused chaos in ORD as they were short 16 business class seats all passengers had to be reassigned their seats which caused my family to be split up and in middle seats - at several thousand dollars each we were not happy. Crew tried their best but no one would move and we were seated all over the cabin. Food was mediocre at best on this route and angled seats did not provide for great sleeping. Entertainment a joke when compared with new United system or with EK/SQ with basically 10 movies 3 of which were >10 years old. FRA-DEL on 747-8 and much better with much nicer crew and flat seats. Departure time from FRA is not ideal as arrival is at 2am compared to 10.30pm with other airlines. Arrival at DEL was a mess with business and first class bags off-loaded last which annoyed premium paying passengers. Only highlight really was LH Senator Lounge in FRA which was very nice. For the price paid I would try another carrier.,,,Business Class,,,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,,2,no
Lufthansa customer review,6,N Barraci,14th February 2014,LH418 FRA-IAD 8 Feb. It was a rather comfortable flight in a not too fully booked Economy Class cabin. My major issue with this flight was about the internet connectivity on board. Unfortunately again FlyNet did not work at all. It has become a rather unreliable service over the last few months. Seating comfort on the new 747-8 is rather good nevertheless when someone sits next to you in Economy it is really a challenge to survive a long-haul flight. The distance to the front seat could be improved but most likely will not. Again I have to point out that as a Lufthansa status customer (Frequent Traveller Star Alliance Silver) I am being treated better by United (complimentary upgrade to Economy plus priority boarding priority luggage) than by Lufthansa.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,3,yes
Lufthansa customer review,10,Bart De Maertelaere,14th February 2014,LH418 Feb 9 2014. As a frequent flyer (and holding Senator status with the Star Alliance) I prefer to fly with Lufthansa and its Star Alliance partners as they offer me the best routes to get me to my destination. On every flight I experienced good service the crew handled any extra requests with a smile.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,10,T Bathory,13th February 2014,LH 429 Jan 31 2014 CLT to MUC. LH 428 Feb 8 2014 MUC-CLT. The service is excellent the crew polite and nice. No significant delays. Food is reasonably good for airline food. We certainly wouldn't choose a different airline to cross the Atlantic.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,9,Matias Sosoi,12th February 2014,I flew from Philadelphia to Frankfurt. Plane was old Airbus A340-300 interior being in clean and good shape. Business having own check-in was nice staff being polite except supervisor having an argument with a customer at next counter. Almost better than real TV. For Business Class passengers there was own boarding lane. At Cabin boarding drink with choices were offered. Business class has lie flat seats but not latest fully flat yet. According to my knowledge Lufthansa is installing new fully flats on their fleet. During flight the service was nice first with cocktail and snacks. 15min later came food service with appetizers with choices. From three warm choices you can choose your main course. Wines were good and I slept rest of the flight comfortably and missed breakfast service.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,9,A Barlow,11th February 2014,LH 435 ORD-MUC 2/6/2014-2/7/2014. Good flight. I was lucky that the seat next to me was empty so I had more space. Otherwise the seat would have been really small. Service staff friendliness punctuality were all better than on previous flights with other airlines.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,2,Bernhard Otten,7th February 2014,LH 457 from LA to Frankfurt Boeing 747 - Seat 35H: There was no space for my feet under the seat because there was a metal box under the seat in front of 35H. For a long distance trip this is not acceptable!,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,,5,no
Lufthansa customer review,9,H Puneck,5th February 2014,"Frankfurt-Abu Dhabi-Frankfurt booked a special for 429 Euro in September flew in January - a 6 day trip. Excellent value for money. New A330 cabin with improved seats in economy class and brand new wireless inflight entertainment system which means no more entertainment box under the seats and therefore more legroom. System with good responsiveness high definition and you can even use your own headphones (""one plug""-system). Flight information system with satellite views is great! WIFI on board for extra cost available on most time of the flight. Staff service as always on Lufthansa efficient friendly correct and professional. Meals decent (1 hot meal 1 sandwich service) wide range of free (even alcoholic) drinks friendly welcome in the galley for more drinks. Hot towel service is always welcome. Only organization of boarding in Abu Dhabi should be improved too narrow waiting lounge for two flights at the same time. Both flights ahead of schedule.",,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,9,Schubert Stefan,5th February 2014,LH 435 Chicago - Munich. January 30 2014. Nothing to complain about flight was on time on board service in general was good however the only point I can complain about is that breakfast could have been better. I suspect that the reason for the quality of breakfast below what one could be expect from Lufthansa is that on flights from the US to Europe catering is done by a US company hence the quality of bread is quite poor.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,1,Jeremy Appleton,4th February 2014,As a very regular customer of Lufthansa I am normally a fan and very happy with the service they offer and provide. Unfortunately my last flight: Frankfurt/Los Angeles (LH 456) was an exception. Having been offered a complimentary upgrade to Business Class at the gate I was then downgraded on board back to Economy with minimal apology nor effort to find a suitable alternative. (I understood the issue as the Business Class seat had in fact been sold to a passenger on Business Class standby but given my status and the value of business I give LH every year it was disappointing). On this occasion the situation was made worse by a particularly difficult neighbor and some average service on board. As I said not a normal experience with Lufthansa but frustrating all the same.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,,3,no
Lufthansa customer review,7,Enrique Simeone,4th February 2014,1st class on FRA-EZE-FRA Boeing 747-400 with only 8 seats which are a rather good option - chair plus bed aside. Service is good but not excellent. Choice of and beverages is just ok. Have travelled them before a few times with this configuration and it is to my liking although not a suite is as good as! Skilled staff but oldie planes. Check in disastrous on all occasions lounge in FRA splendid in EZE and Sao a disaster! Not as good as flying Swiss international.,,,First Class,,,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,7,Meirsschaert Pascal,3rd February 2014,I took the flight to Orlando from Frankfurt and back from Charleston to Munich. Sufficient space in Economy. There could be some better variation in food selection. Free drinks is much appreciated. Inflight entertainment could do with a wider selection of recent movies.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,9,T Powell,3rd February 2014,Sao Paulo to Frankfurt and on to Madrid. Checked in for my flights and was treated in a courteous and friendly manner. Chaos at Guarulhos due to the construction work ahead of the World Cup. Our gate remained occupied by a TAP A340 with a delayed departure leading to being bussed to our 747 parked at a remote stand. Pushed back from the stand about 1.5 hours late and waited in a long line for take-off. Nice reception on-board and seated in a center aisle with the middle seat free. The service was excellent and the food of a decent quality with the usual drinks and wine of your choice. I have to say that I find the LH business class seat lacking in comfort and as it doesn't go flat is quite hard to find a comfortable sleeping position. It is time for a revamp of that seat. The entertainment selection is good and I particularly like one of the radio channels. Headsets are decent but not up to the Bose quality used by other carriers. This is an 11 hour flight so plenty of time to relax. Breakfast was good and I find the cabin crew to be of a consistently high standard. Fix that seat and this is a very competitive product.,,,Business Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,4,Zinsser Werner,31st January 2014,LH457. Departure and arrival on time. Confusing boarding practise in Los Angeles. Narrow seats not comfortable. Meals on board OK. Service average - recommendation only if LH is less expensive than competitors (Singapore Airlines / Emirates).,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,,3,yes
Lufthansa customer review,9,Joachim Schorr,31st January 2014,26/1/2014 LH 438 Frankfurt - Dallas. Very dedicated service and personnel when the cabin is not full service becomes slow when Fist Class is fully booked as there only is one person serving. Great Food and wine section and good media service. Still too many planes around which have the old setting in place not on the last trip which was great.,,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,7,Matthias Beuge,31st January 2014,Boston to Munich LH425. Reliable friendly in-flight and check-in staff. Poor SMS system for flight updates. One SMS informs customers that the flight is late another one about 1.5 hours later told customers the flight will be on time. When arriving at the airport it was late again. They are still doing averagely when it comes to pampering of their top status customers. There is hardly ever a complimentary upgrade while my US colleagues on US carriers get upgraded 75% of the time on long haul flights.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,7,F Luigi,29th January 2014,LH429 CLT-MUC A330: Flight very cold but service food and beverages ok. New Policy for Miles a little bit complex for economy class: too many classes and you can't select the right one when you book a flight.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,3,yes
Lufthansa customer review,8,Tasselli Valerio,29th January 2014,LH419 January 23. Washington to Frankfurt. Plane was half empty so it was a very smooth and quiet ride. Always pretty satisfied with the efficiency of Lufthansa although they could improve the quality and seating space.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,7,H Mutschler,28th January 2014,Flew CGN-MUC on a Saturday. Onward flight was nearly empty so you could seat any seat. Two drinks one coffee and one apple juice on a nice Airbus 321. Return flight on the same day was packed so all bins where overloaded. It took ages to board. Got drinks as well crew did a good job for a 55 minutes flight.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,,3,yes
Lufthansa customer review,2,Keller Christoph,28th January 2014,I travelled flight LH456 on Saturday 18th January from Frankfurt to Los Angeles. It was extremely cold on this plane due to some problems with the air-conditioning (seat 33H). Other passengers seated in rows in front of me were complaining as it was too hot on their seats! This must be a major problem and to be honest I was very dissatisfied with this situation. The flight attendants did a great job.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,2,yes
Lufthansa customer review,7,H Schumacher,28th January 2014,I fly Lufthansa a lot long distance. Overall a very solid impression mostly on time friendly and competent staff. Quality of meals has decreased in economy as has seat comfort but that is normal these days. Major complaint on LH456 (FRA-LAX) on a 747-8: The touch screen user experience was ridiculous some input takes 10-20 s to be processed. Not only the case in my seat but pretty much everyone I observed had this problem.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,2,Kim Krister,28th January 2014,HEL-MUC/FRA-MAD return. I don't like their new loyalty program downgrade. I booked quite high priced booking class ticket last year hoping to earn more miles and to renew my Frequent Flyer status and loyalty with them just to be faced with the fact that earning miles is now 25% - 50% from mileage flown unless you pay full Y or C priced ticket. 23hrs check in before flight is useless 3 of my 4 flights were of change of equipment and I was automatically moved from reserved first Y row seat to the last rows of the bus. Very inconvenient as I had to wait a long time to get deplaned. Their onboard product has downgraded with NEK seat. 2 x 2hr 20min flight segments resulted me back muscle pain. Seat is so thin and narrow making noises when moving on it it is the most uncomfortable way to travel. Their refreshment offering is okay but snacks are inedible - no healthy and fresh options anymore. Cabin crew did their best service was professional with smiles. Lounge access was good as layovers were 3hrs 30min too long. Loyalty for this airline is completely useless for me I will change my loyalty to another Scandinavian carrier with better timetables.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,,1,no
Lufthansa customer review,9,S Brandt,28th January 2014,Flight Abu Dhabi-Frankfurt: new business class seats on this night flight an absolute improvement compared to the old seat that is still in use. Wish all Lufthansa long haul seats in this class were already installed! Service on board really friendly and chatty. Nice snack and aperitif after departure good breakfast 1 hour prior to arrival. Could have been served 15 mins earlier but at the same time crew allowed us to sleep longer. Inflight entertainment improved as well a lot. The map/route should have music in the background. The new seat is perfect to sleep completely flat. Amenity kit is a plus. Smooth flight and professional service. A330 10 years old but in perfect condition. Welcome lounge in Frankfurt a nice place to have a shower and another great breakfast after this night flight.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,6,Wilhelm Diemo,25th January 2014,LH430 FRA-ORD Jan 20 2014 New 747-8. Seat comfort is inferior to most other airlines on this segment. Loyalty customer treatment (especially in regards to complimentary upgrades) is unacceptable seems non-existent all the way up to Senator (incl.) and might become real only with HON which is super exclusive. Food quality is average and staff attention in economy is also just average. Staff attention visibly improves from business class onwards. Inflight entertainment is a bad joke especially in economy as well as in any 'old' business or first class seat. Tiny monitors that are often defective. Fairly small movie selection. This is way behind the other airlines that LH wants to compete with. Economy seats in the new 747-8 are ok but seat comfort in the first economy aisle seat right behind business class is impacted by staff continuously pushing the blinds against the passengers legs.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3,yes
Lufthansa customer review,10,Lange Michael,22nd January 2014,Flight DUS-MUC in the evening. Short flight from DUS to MUC. Friendly staff free Drinks (water tea coffee wine bear soft drinks) and savory snacks. We left on time and reached MUC about 20 min early.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,8,Th Echter,22nd January 2014,Frankfurt - Rio de Janeiro - Frankfurt with Lufthansa on A340. On time smooth decent hassle free and without any problems. Extremely friendly professional and attentive crew on both flights. Cocktails served after take off really nice dinner. Large movie selection on personal screens. 2-4-2 seats making it easier for a couple to sit together. Absolutely nothing to complain if there was not the seat itself: Narrow uncomfortable and one of the worst of all my flights. Unfortunately different from other airlines economy seats.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,3,yes
Lufthansa customer review,8,Gabriels Bart,22nd January 2014,LH428. Positives: Smooth trip to U.S. Good service nice entertainment program nice food and drinks. To improve: Seat was in the last row of the plane and I didn't had so much space for my legs.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,5,D Chakarov,22nd January 2014,LH456 from Frankfurt to Los Angeles. The flight went smoothly and on time (arriving ahead of schedule). No complaints about the flight conditions and service except the performance of the information/entertainment system. The touch screen was not responding thus making the use impossible. I see two main problems - the system is outdated and not properly serviced. However this was a smaller problem for me compared with the failure of the promised Wi-Fi connection.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,4,Miczinski Lars,22nd January 2014,Frankfurt (FRA) to Washington Dulles (IAD) LH 418 on December 9 2013. Space comfort in economy class is not great there should be more space! The entertainment program quality was not great it appears to me that mainly only old films are shown in economy class not quite sure if this has something to do with cost savings. I don't understand the beverage concept of Lufthansa I wish there was more non alcoholic beer on board.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,,3,yes
Lufthansa customer review,6,S Madiwal,21st January 2014,It's always a pleasure flying with Lufthansa. The flight LH 490 was ready on time for departure and the crew aboard welcomed all with a smile. The aircraft was new and cleanliness in the cabin was satisfactory. This time there was no aerobridge and the boarding was via bus. This added to a bit of inconvenience to some passengers. The new Airbus cabin storage is comparatively small and passengers had to struggle finding a place to put their carry on luggage. Overall the food and beverages selection was good. I would highly recommend this flight to my family and friends.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,8,Eigel Herbert,21st January 2014,The flight (LH431) was as expected good. The chosen seat was good for my long legs. Departure and Arrival was nearly on time. Only the served breakfast was very poor.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,10,Claudio Cappello,20th January 2014,Flight LH430 was perfect. New Business class seats are really good and comfortable. I've received the upgrade from the economy with no additional costs. Entertainment was ok but sleep on the plane was better and the traveler kit was very helpful. I'll do it again.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,8,A Kreyssig,17th January 2014,Dec 21 2013 LH431 ORD-FRA. Efficient and friendly service. The new 747-8 aircraft offers a modern ambience in the Economy class LH standard seats with individual now well-functioned entertainment system but still the usual limited space.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,10,M Studzinski,16th January 2014,London LHR - Frankfurt. Quick 1 hour flight. Friendly enthusiastic and chatty crew sandwiches offered and full bar service incl. German sparkling wine and bottled beer even in Economy. All on time perfect.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,9,Stuettgen Johannes,16th January 2014,ORD-MUC LH 435 Jan 11th. Great Service Food is ok but the inflight entertainment system is pretty bad. Movie selection is rather small and the touchscreen is so unresponsive its a pain to navigate the menu.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,8,D Eickhoelter,16th January 2014,LH 415 Washington-Munich. 10/11 Jan 2014. Overall very good. Friendly service. Good (new) business class seats. I was surprised that I did not get entry to the Star Alliance Lounge at Washington airport even though I had a business class ticket and being FTL silver.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,8,G Howman,16th January 2014,DOH-FRA-YVR: Both legs of flight on A340 aircraft. Not my optimum choice of long-haul platform; however Lufthansa really made the best of things. Traveled economy both legs yet found that both seat space and leg room were more than adequate. Food was so-so and selection of movies average. However cabin crew were very attentive and customer oriented. This airline is becoming my airline of choice.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,8,S Khezzar,14th January 2014,FRA to ORD. I slept most of the time on board so there was not much I had to complain about. Flight attendants very nice and friendly. Boarding in FRA is always very chaotic. It is much better organized in ORD. LH should handle the boarding procedure for FRA like they do it in ORD. I'd recommend that Lufthansa would send an e-mail notification when the plane changes so that passengers who book early can make sure that they can keep their reserved seat.,,,Premium Economy,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,9,Eric Heilmann,14th January 2014,Frankfurt to Washington Dulles on Jan 8 flight LH418. Return on Jan 10th flight LH419. I have been flying Lufthansa for many years now both professionally and privately. It is not a cheap airline but I admit that I still use it for my private trips because of the impeccable quality of service at all levels. As a Senator passenger I know I get more perks but I see all the time the genuine attention that the staff puts in when dealing with every passenger. After having delt for many years with numerous american airlines I find this very refreshing!,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,9,Ruediger Beyer,13th January 2014,Flight 490 from Frankfurt / Germany to Seattle / WA on January 6 2014. Very punctual smooth flight. On board service very good. Temperature in plane too low. Entertainment programme and internet service excellent. Digital flight information very good. Meal service fine except for oversight to remove moist cloth and empty cups/cans before serving dinner. Overall impression very good.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,10,M Tushishvili,13th January 2014,30 December 2013 Paris to Tbilisi via Munich LH2237 and LH2556. 8 January 2014 Tbilisi to Paris via Munich LH2557 and LH2230. Check-in was easy and pleasant with brilliant ground staff in Tbilisi. On board cabin crew were polite and hard working especially on the MUC-TBS leg on 30 December. Hot food was served in MUC-TBS-MUC segments and it was very tasty both times. Lufthansa and Turkish are recommended airlines for travelers to Tbilisi.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,10,Lloyd Michael,13th January 2014,Manchester UK to Munich LH 2501. Munich to Chicago LH434. I travel with Lufthansa regularly from Great Britain to USA in either Business or First Class. The overall service is always excellent. I can fly directly to the USA from Manchester (UK) but the standard and service of the US Airlines is way below that offered by Lufthansa. Meals are always excellent seating extremely comfortable and cabin staff courteous and helpful. Travelling via Germany adds to my journey time but I find it well worthwhile. Additionally the standard of Lufthansa Lounges are far superior to US Airline ones.,,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,8,Duzzi Riccardo,10th January 2014,VCE-FRA-AMS on 28 December 2013 and then AMS-FRA-VCE on 3 January 2014. Flights were all nice and all on time on comfortable A321 and A319. It didn't make sense that they gave us food on 16:35 pm flight to AMS and not on 12:45 pm flight to FRA but this is just an insignificant detail. Staff was good and smiling and flight experience was good too. I recommend Lufthansa.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,8,Ana Vetere Arellano,9th January 2014,LH457: I was quite satisfied with this flight. Stewards and stewardesses were friendly food was of good quality and entertainment offered was very good. My 5 year old daughter enjoyed the cartoons. I would suggest that if seats are available travellers with children could be positioned in the plane so that they can be given an extra seat so the child can sleep better. Of course if the flight is full I understand that this is not at all feasible.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,10,R Jonquieres,9th January 2014,"Flight LH434 from Munich to Chicago was a real pleasure. Smooth ride and super crew - friendly and professional.

Lufthansa customer review,7,Guder Petra,8th January 2014,Very good and attentive service on 431 from ORD to FRA on January 3rd - even though it was economy class. The meal quality was bad completely tasteless chicken and the seats plus legroom too narrow too much of a sardine box feeling during a long distance flight.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,,3,yes
Lufthansa customer review,7,Uwe Langhammer,8th January 2014,IAD-FRA on B747-8 and FRA-IAH A380. Both flights were good. Friendliness in Business is much better than Economy. Good food and Service on both legs. Lounge in IAD with separate access gate to the plane is a plus. The new Business on the B747-8 let the old one on the A380 feel really outdated. It was hard to get a seat in the Z-Gate Business Lounge in FRA.,,,Business Class,,,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,2,yes

Lufthansa customer review,8,Harald Pleiner,8th January 2014,LH 456 on January 4 2014. The flight from FRA to LAX was delayed 2 hours at take off due to first a technical problem and second an ill passenger whose luggage had to be removed from the airplane. At arrival the plane was only one hour late because of a higher cruising speed the plane was rather new (747-8) and comfortable the food was good - quite a positive surprise on a trans-atlantic flight. Only the cabin temperature was unpleasantly low - and this is rather frequently found in LH long distance flights.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,4,yes

Lufthansa customer review,10,Karl Moosbrugger,7th January 2014,DEL-FRA-SZB in Business. Check-in was easy the new lounge in Delhi has sufficient space free wifi and pretty good snacks and drinks. On board the lie-flat seats on the 747-800 were very comfortable and I had a good sleep. Flight was on-time and the breakfast before landing was very tasty (I had the Indian breakfast).,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,9,Guido Galley,7th January 2014,LH456 from FRA to LAX on Jan 2 2014 with a Boeing 747-8 aircraft seat 1K. Excellent service and excellent food in the First Class Terminal in Frankfurt and on the plane to LAX. Highly recommended! Everything was presented very well and the quality was perfect. I also like the Bose noise cancellation headphones that the seat is equipped with.,,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,4,yes
Lufthansa customer review,6,Ralf Schwimmbeck,7th January 2014,LH 419 from IAD to FRA. The lounge in IAD is less than average for First Class. The first Class seats are good and LH provides a heavy mattress and bedding to sleep. However LH has a policy of keeping the cabin at 23 deg C which is just too warm to sleep with all the heavy blankets I wish they would cool their cabin to a normal temp. The food was ok but certainly not great. The service from the flight staff was excellent. Finding my connection in Frankfurt was quite difficult and took quite a while to find the first class lounge.,,,First Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,,3,yes
Lufthansa customer review,10,M Taylor,7th January 2014,Lufthansa continues to have fantastic economy service. The air hostesses tend to be older than other airlines but their experience shows in the brilliant service given. The attendants are helpful and they also have free coffee/tea etc in their Munich airport area which is a big bonus. Additionally the beer on board is better than other airlines Warsteiner. The food is similar to others in the same category - the only complaint is the number of films available. Perhaps there are 50 different films but compared to Etihad or others this falls a bit short by today's standards. I was on a new Boeing 747-8 which is rare as I almost always fly Airbus routes which may have made my trip more enjoyable.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,5,yes
Lufthansa customer review,9,Milan Zelcevic,6th January 2014,FRA-DXB return flight. Very good service on the way out. Good flight nice crew very uneventful. On the way back almost as good. The 747 landed in heavy clouds and didn't feel a thing. Entertainment is ok but not at the level of say Air Canada. On the way back I asked for lactose-free meal and got one that was pretty good. A great airline and a great experience.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,4,yes
