"""not tell me what my refund would be""",6,William Eaton,7th September 2021,"✅ Trip Verified |  EVA Air is a great airline, in the air, less so when there is a problem on the ground. My return to Taipei from Chicago was cancelled three times (September 4, 6, 9).. I believe that they could do better in customer service, particularly in rescheduling. On Friday, I called about my cancelled flight; the phone rep did not suggest any alternative itineraries (I can't wait two weeks for the ORD route to open up). I suggested flying through Houston instead of Chicago. The rep told me that my new flight plans would not be confirmed until Monday (and that there may or may not be a fee for changing my itinerary). I decided today to cancel and fly another airline. The representative could not tell me what my refund would be. She instructed me to email the EVA office in Chicago and they would let me know when they get back to work after the holiday. The website and app are adequate for booking a ticket, but seem worthless to deal with any problems. And, if the app/website is worthless for rebooking, why can't the phone reps give firm answers about rebooking and fees?

"""layover transit ban in Taipei""",1,C Heales,28th August 2021,"✅ Trip Verified |  Be wary of purchasing tickets for EVA air flights. The lower fare belies the issue with the layover transit ban in Taipei. Although a small screen on a page will alert you to this ban, it states that the ban will be in effect for only a month (until Aug 31, 2021 as of this writing). Some people are willing to risk having their flight canceled. However Taipei has a history of extending this ban every 30 days since May 2021.  If we had known that Taipei had a record of protracting their transit ban, we would not have purchased this ticket. Ultimately, we canceled our booking, paid the $120.00 surcharge and booked a direct flight with another airline out of LAX just for peace of mind.

Because of the new rules imposed by the government of the Philippines to incoming travellers, we decided to just cancel our trip. We requested a refund from Eva Air but we were surprised that only about 60% will be refunded in 5-10 days. We’re still waiting for the return of the money. Almost 40% penalty charges is just too much. We feel like this is taking undue advantage especially at this time of the pandemic. Eva Air should be more compassionate to their customers.

I appreciate that Taiwan prides itself on efficiency, but perhaps a little more attention could be spared to hospitality. On the plus side, the flight was on schedule and the plane was very clean. On the minus side, one meal for a five hour flight and nothing else, not even passing through with a tray of water in a plastic glass. The seat selection was a bad joke: the plane was 90% empty, but on the online seat selection I was offered a choice of only two seats, neither at a window, both at the aisle.

The challenge for me, though, was being able to check in my bag right at an hour before departure from Seoul, as I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to make it to the airport in time via public transport in the early morning. Happily, that wasn't a problem. I was able to make it to the check-in gate right on time, the staff were friendly and checked my bags with no issues. Gate staff in Seoul and Taipei were pleasant. The flights to Taipei and then to Los Angeles were drama-free. I found the cabin and lavatories clean and staff courteous. I did find the seats slightly more cramped (maybe just my perception) and in-flight entertainment and meals to be a little boring, though, compared to previous experiences using JAL and Singapore, these still fare better than most North American carriers in my opinion.

"""It was a fantastic flight""",9,J Tung,27th June 2020,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Taipei during the pandemic. EVA only sells full fare ticket during this period so my tickets cost double of the usual price. However this is totally understandable, and I was able to select my seat once the ticket is booked. Check in at Heathrow was bit chaotic but this was due to the airport organisation to ensure social distance (which in my opinion only creates more queue than distance). EVA has requested some forms to be filled prior to checking in and also Taiwanese government requires online registration so they can monitor each single arriving passenger. The queue to reach check in took around 90 minutes. Once check in was performed it was very smooth to go through security. After security the only shops opened were Boots and WH Smith. Boarding was in good order. EVA enforced boarding zones to reduce congestion. Temperature of all passengers were taken and recorded. The crew members were in full PPE (goggles, facial mask, glove and apron) but still welcome passengers with a warm smile. The plane is a 3 year old B777-300 but it was spotless. EVA planes are perhaps the cleanest among all but it's evident that special cleaning had been implemented during this period. Most of the Taiwanese passenger also wore personal PPE and everyone was wiping their seat/table/screen once onboard. The flight pushed back some 30 minutes behind schedule due to delay on ground service. We were given amenity kits, blanket and a bottle of water while we wait on the ground. We were served two hot meals throughout the flight - one dinner and one breakfast. Both meals were tasty. They also announced few times that food and drink service was altered to meet additional hygiene standard. Toilets on the plane was kept spotless through the journey in a typical EVA fashion. Choices of movie/TV was limited. This has never been the strong point of EVA and perhaps during this tough time for aviation this has been cut back further. However I was still able to find some movie and TV programs to keep me occupied when I wasn't sleepy. The 13 hour flight passed quick and it was a very quiet 13 hours. All passenger wore their mask throughout. The flight landed in Taipei 20 minutes later than schedule but it only took me less than 30 minutes to leave the airport - that included buying a new SIM card, finishing the health screen registration, passing immigration and collecting luggage. The luggage was also disinfected before they reached the belt. It was a fantastic flight - very calm and relaxing despite the various measures enforced.

The IFE product, for me far more than I needed, ample movies and music, games and tv shows. On the music area it has a great feature that you can save lots of music to a play list and then you can listen to it. I listen to classical music while I sleep so I save tons of songs to the play list and listen for hours while sleeping. Food, always excellent, hot and tasty and always more than enough.

The aircraft are clean and modern, food of reasonable standard, and Flight Attendants efficient. As Australians, and hence English speaking, communication was at a minimum with us. Announcements were very difficult for me to hear on all flights. Premium Economy seats were good, but passengers in front reclined seats for full journey, making our seats and activity in flight very uncomfortable.

"""Overall a pleasant flight""",7,J Tung,15th October 2019,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flew from LHR to BKK return last week on premium economy. Overall a pleasant flight and will definitely recommend it again. Of course it's not as good as their business class but it represents great value. Check in at both Heathrow and Bangkok were super efficient. At Bangkok despite there being multiple flights leaving at the same time to Europe and Taipei, the check in lanes for business and premium economy were empty and the check in process took less than 5 minutes. This is far superior than most of the European business class check in experience (BA/Air France and KLM in particular). Flights took off on time and landed ahead of schedule. The seat itself was very comfortable - I found the seat to be more spacious than those on Cathay Pacific. Service on the outbound flight was efficient and standard but on the way back the crew was very friendly and professional. The plane was clean, food was tasty and the crew walked around the cabin few times offering water and food post main meal. There is never a long queue for the toilet. The big let down with EVA is the limited choice of movie/TV programme. I was lucky I found a Taiwanese TV drama that I wanted to watch otherwise you'd better preload your ipad with Netflix or BBC Iplayer. There was also an incident when we landed in Bangkok. Due to heavy thunder and rain the airport ground service was suspended but no information was given. Had to wait for 2 hours for the luggage to come out. Compared with my last EVA premium economy flight (2 years ago), I personally feel that sadly the service has declined - although it's still above most of the airlines premium economy. The toilets in premium economy on my previous flight was spotless and I think they have reduced the frequency of cleaning. Nevertheless EVA is still a great option to fly to Asia from US/Europe.

EVA Air was the first Asian carrier I've flown on and my first experience in long-haul business class. From this point I am completely sold on them. The quality of the service and food on both my flights was fantastic. The cabin crew in Business Class are very attentive and quickly are at your seat as soon as your glass or plate is empty with another drink or meal course. As someone who works in the aviation industry I am all too familiar with the intricacies of an airline from front-line to behind-the-scenes. All four of my flights departed on time and when faced with a difficult situation (arriving 35 minutes prior to departure due to an airport-access issue) the ground staff were accommodating and whisked me through security. Surprisingly my baggage also made the flight which was something I was concerned with. If I had to find a negative it would unfortunately be the Plaza Premium lounge EVA Air uses in Toronto. This lounge was extremely basic and the food/drink options were minimal. For an airline who prides themselves on their quality I'd have expected them to opt for a better lounge option. On the other hand, their Infinity Lounge in Taipei was the complete opposite (obviously being that it is at their hub they have more control) with ample food, drink, and comfort options.",Boeing 777-300ER,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Toronto to Taipei via Tokyo,September 2019,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5,yes

She was very pleasant and friendly though sometimes I had a little hard time understanding her English. We managed and everything went well.

Once landing in Taipei, only had less than one hour to make the transfer to the Houston flight so I was trying to walk as fast as I could. As is always the case our arrival gate was way way down from the transfer area, I thought it was a mile walk. As I approached the transfer area there were two employees of EVA Air announcing the Houston flight and I said I was going there, then they asked my name and I told them and to my surprise they handed me a new boarding pass that upgraded me to Premium Economy on the Taipei Houston flight. I was dumbfounded bue very appreciative of this gesture by EVA Air. I managed the transfer i and arrived at the airplane like 15 minutes before departure. Having tried the premium economy product before, I proceeded to settle on my seat for the long flight home. Shortly after take off we were served our dinner. The PM product has one additional serving of food, akin to an appetizer. All the food served was very good tasty and proper temperature, cold when needed to be cold and hot was needed to be hot. Service was flawless as it always has been for me with EVA. Shortly  after I slept for a while and missed the snack and then proceeded to watch movies and listen to music until landing. The second meal was also on point and I arrived rested and well fed in Houston. All in all this was my 6th trip with EVA and my 24th flight with them in 3 years and I have never been disappointed.

While EVA deserves its reputation as a top airline, my most recent experience with EVA was not my best. During my 6/2019 flight from ORD to TPE, I had to call for a Flight Attendant 3 times for a beverage before an attendant came over. The flight attendants just disappeared after the first meal, that often happens on USA airlines, but I have never experienced that on EVA before. Another note: the plane was just a bit too warm to sleep well. I have requested to lower the temp on other EVA flights and usually, FAs do lower it a bit, but this time, my fault, I just too dispirited to ask, and I will dress more lightly on the return.

I was grateful EVA kept the ticketing desk open all night for those of us who were waiting, however, the six EVA agents stationed in front of the queue doing nothing productive but chatting with each other could have been better utilized at the ticket desk assisting customers to find alternative flights and lessening the waiting time. After 10 hours of waiting, I was assisted and offered different options for my return flight to the US. The agents were mostly helpful but seemed annoyed when I refused their initial offer of return flights with no seat assignment or were a lesser booking class than my original ticket. In the end, EVA agents were able to rebook/reroute me on a return flight with one stop.

I'm glad I was able to check out EVA because Cathay disappointed me (review to follow). Check-in was pretty standard. It took a while because the person who checked us in was new. How did I know? Her name bar said ""in training"". The company decided it would be more fun to have passengers ask her how long she has been in training instead of her name. I think its funny and just a bit irritating when people queue up near the gate door when its not their time to board yet. They block the people whose row numbers have been called. That's not the airline's fault, though. Boarding an international flight seems easier than a domestic one. People move faster and get out of the aisle faster it seems. The flight attendants were super helpful with helping with bags. They were so proactive that there was no last minute struggle for bin space. We had some guy sitting in one of our seats and with a little help translating the ground staff was quick to find his correct seat. He was in the middle seat behind us and tried to take our window. Anyone would have tried to score a window seat in an empty row! The seats had lots of leg room. But I'm short so my opinion shouldn't count. One thing that's tough about being short though. Is sometimes I cant put my feet flat on the ground unless I scoot up in the seat. This made is a little hard to sleep. But I just reclined my seat and curled up on my side and did the best I could. I also had a face to face with my tray table. The food was hit or miss. My first meal was beef. I forget what the beef came with but the other items on the tray were fruit and a green vegetable I didn't like much. The beef was really good though! For breakfast the choices were congee or omelette. Since I'm sick of airplane omelettes. I chose the congee. It was really bland. I ate the yogurt and fruit and was happy.

When I finally got a representative to explain what the waiting list meant, I was told, I may be taken off at any time, but probably be notified about up to 1 week leading up to the flight. I waited, but no notifications came. Finally 2 days before the flight, I contacted the Taiwan office and  was told that the flight was sold out and I would not be able to get on the flight, or even buy a ticket for the flight. So, I was left without a flight option for that day. To get a refund of the $30 tax I paid, I would have to pay a $50 cancellation fee.  Their loyalty program does not work or reward at all, only served to make things difficult, cause me to book an extremely higher priced and longer duration flight.

I came to like EVA Air more when I almost missed my connecting flight today. Our time of departure from LAX was an hour delayed due to air traffic. My connecting flight to KUL was supposed to depart at 7am and boarding gate opens at 6:30. I knew then that I would surely miss my flight to KL when the flight info showed that our ETA in Taipei would be 6:35. I was worried because I missed my flight with another airline once before. Then, our flight from LAX was 1.5 hours delayed. Even though the plane landed 30 mins before the ETD, I was no longer allowed to take my connecting flight and so I just had to fly the next day.

"""seamless five star experience""",10,W. Robert Kmen,27th May 2018,"✅ Trip Verified |  This trip from Hong Kong to Toronto was a seamless five star experience. Check-in at HKG terminal one was instantaneous and my suitcase was tagged through to Tampa. The priority security line took perhaps two minutes and immigration was equally quick. The Star Gold lounge closest to our departure gate was the United Club, which was satisfactory. Boarding was disciplined and business class passengers were shown to their seats and greeted by name. We were immediately offered sparkling wine or juice and received the menu and wine list for the short flight to Taipei. The full meal was served on HKG-TPE; I chose the sweet and sour pork, and it was excellent. Once airborne, a good champagne ( DeLamotte Blanc de Blancs ) replaced the sparkling wine. In hindsight, I indulged myself too much in the lounge and on the short flight so that I was not able to really appreciate the headline long-haul flight TPE to YYZ. On that flight, they served Veuve Clicquot La Grande Dame, but I was only able to sample half a glass. I also short circuited the eight course dinner meal and skipped straight to the fruit plate. The flight attendants could not have been more eager to serve and please. They addressed passengers by name throughout the flight and did their best to anticipate any request. The seats on EVA's 777-300's are arranged in a 1-2-1 pattern and are wide and comfortable. However, passengers who choose window seats to enjoy looking out may be disappointed because you are seated a good distance from the window.

On this airline the economy product is great and really in my previous two trips I had no complaints on the service whatsoever.

If you can get the exit seats, even better. The crew on all my flights spoke good English; sometimes, the purser is really hard to understand over the PA system. Transit thru Taoyuan International is also a non-issue. Just follow the signs. It can be unnerving if you have a short connection between flights because the second screening lines can be long.

Once in the airplane the flight attendants all very friendly and efficient to make sure we make it to our assigned seats. This was to be a 16.30 flight to Taipei.

"""good value for money""",7,M Clark,1st April 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | This was my second time flying EVA Air (return flight from Cebu to Vancouver via Taipei). I wrote an earlier review of my Vancouver to Cebu flight. Check-In - Quick and painless. Paid online for window seats through Flight Hub when I bought the return ticket in the fall but that was not honored by EVA. Was told that there is no such paid pre-flight seat selection arrangement between EVA and Flight Hub. Grrr! I griped about that in my previous review. Settled for an aisle seat. The check-in staff were efficient and courteous. Flight to Taipei - The plane was a gleaming A321 with the Hello Kitty livery. I thought that was cool as it added to the festive atmosphere inside the plane that was packed with returning tourists. Meals and IFE were identical to my previous Taipei to Cebu flight. The cabin service was fine but a notch below that of the longer Taipei to Vancouver leg. I suspect EVA uses less experienced flight attendants for the shorter flights within the ASEAN region. Flight to Vancouver - The screening of passengers from the waiting lounge to the actual boarding area one floor down left a sour taste in my mouth. I witnessed how a stern-looking young lady, possibly in her mid 20s, was berating a middle-aged Asian couple for supposedly ""not having the right documents"" to travel to Canada. A big part of the problem was communication as English was a second language to both parties. How I wished the EVA staff was more professional. Instead of being overbearing and raising her voice in the hope of getting her point across, she should have discreetly pulled the couple aside and then asked another staff, possibly with better communication skills and more empathy than her, to sort the matter with the passengers, who were visibly humiliated in front of so many passengers in the queue. Incidents like this make me really angry. The flight back was excellent. New Boeing 777-300ER. Decent warm meals albeit with minuscule serving of drinks. Five-star IFE. Skilled and attentive flight attendants. (I mentioned in my first review that they needed to hone their soft skills though.) The only negative was the inability of the flight attendants to handle some of the passengers, who were part of a tour group. During boarding, some of them were in near stampede to get available overhead bins as others barked instructions to members of their group. Others were completely oblivious to their invading the personal space of other passengers while lining up for the washroom. I was seated at 69C which was three rows from the last row in the rear. Beware of that aisle seat. It did not have a restful 10-hour flight given the constant flux and occasional chatter of people going to the washrooms. In spite of the negatives some of which were beyond the airline's control, EVA represents a good value for the money.

"""a very good flying experience""",8,E Marlin,31st March 2018,"✅ Trip Verified |  Vancouver to Cebu via Taipei. My first time to try EVA, which is unfamiliar to me.  I did an internet search and was pleasantly surprised to know that EVA has a 5-star rating. That set the tenor of my expectation when I flew in early January 2018. Arrived at YVR airport 4 hours prior to my flight and the lineup was already building up at the counter assigned to EVA. I waited only 20 minutes from the time the staff started the check-in process. I paid for window seats when I bought my return ticket from Flight Hub only to be told that EVA does not honour such arrangement with Flight Hub. The staff told me that this was an ongoing problem. (It is incredibly hard dealing with Flight Hub and getting back what I paid for the window seats for the 4 sectors.)  My main carry-on was 7 kg. I thought my smaller bag with my laptop, tablet, chargers, etc. would be okay given what the online baggage guidelines say. Was wrong and asked to transfer some of my stuff to one of my checked-ins, which was below the limit. In fairness to EVA, the staff were very courteous. Boarding was organized and uneventful. The flight was fully booked. The Boeing 777-ER300 was either brand new or newly refitted. I was assigned to a middle seat next (46J) to the emergency exit. Acres of legroom but no overhead bin for my bags. The meals were decent but drinks were consistently served in minuscule volume compared to what I am used to with North American airlines. The washrooms must have been cleaned and restocked at least twice during the 13-hour flight to Taipei.  In-flight entertainment was top notch featuring the latest Hollywood offerings. 5 stars! In-flight service would have given 5 stars too but I cannot. The cabin staff were efficient albeit in a cold manner. They need to beef up their soft skills and learn the art of making passengers feel genuinely welcome.  Smile and say welcome in a way that jives with your non-verbal cues. Gently take the bag of someone who is struggling to find space in the overhead bin instead of brusquely grabbing the bag without saying anything or making eye contact to assure the passenger you are there to help. Transit in Taipei was smooth and quick. We changed to an A321 for the flight to Cebu. The boarding gate was changed the last minute. I had difficulty understanding the instructions over the PA. A few other non-Chinese passengers had the same challenge. I got to Cebu in one piece after a three-hour flight. Thanks to EVA Air.

I'm not excessively tall (180cm), but big enough that I fill in the seat and can use every bit of legroom I can get. On this particular flight, legroom was not an issue for me at all and even the width of the seat was plenty for me. Being a new plane we had the wide(r) touch-screen entertainment system and the selection of movies and television shows was adequate. Even tried out a couple of the games and they were entertaining enough to pass some time. Food was hit-and-miss. On the flight to Toronto they served a pesto chicken pasta that was actually really delicious. Other meals were good or just okay. There was always something on the tray to my liking though. Service was good as well, no issues to report. The best part is that I was comfortable enough to sleep the majority of the 15+ hour flight. Comparatively, the next leg was on a much older plane (also EVA) and the comfort of the seats and the age of the entertainment system certainly fell compared to the flight prior.

The flight attendants did a very good job during the flights on both legs, it seems they take their job very seriously. Checking the passengers, baggage compartments, emergency exits was done several time by the flight attendants as a matter of safety (more times than I've seen with other airlines).

"""better alternatives out there""",1,Ailyn Daya,29th November 2017,"✅ Trip Verified | Toronto to Taipei. Where to commence this critique of my first experience with Eva Air. Spoiler Alert: Do not even think of using this airline. At the airport they insist on checking the credit card that you used to purchase the ticket initially. Never mind that the ticket was purchased 10 months ago and the credit card may have expired or have been renewed and therefore no longer exists. And why? Oh, it because of potential fraud – so lets get this right – ticket was bought 10 months ago, if there was any fraud involved, it would have been detected by now. Oh and by the way the ticket is in the same name as the credit card holder who paid it 10 months ago. Tried to check in on-line (within 24 hours) – won’t let you. So, a call is placed to reservation hotline (love the word) – no answer – had to hang up after 2 hours waiting for an answer. It's check in time at the airport now. At the counter, they insist on weighing hand luggage! If over 5 kilos, not allowed. So what to do? Answer from the male supervisor – take it home and re-pack! Really? Go home, re-pack and come back even though 3 kilos over the weight? Sign luggage waivers – they make you sign waivers for the luggage – never ever encountered this before Over heard from adjacent counter: Lady had purchased ticket 12 months ago – was told flight was full and she couldn’t get a seat. At the gate, the topic de jour was Filipinos complaining about Eva Air and their handling of their customers. Moral of this story: Travel Eva Air at your peril, unless you want to face humiliation, incredibly poor service and treated like dirt!

Cleanliness: despite not being the brand new airplanes, it was well maintained. Toilets were kept in a good condition Taipei airport – being the home base of EVA, the terminal 2 is over crowded in the departure hall.

But this latest sector was I believe a new aircraft with newly designed flimsy seats. I’m average height and build and I just pity any taller travellers or those carrying a few extra pounds. I have never been so uncomfortable on a flight in my life. The seat base was so hard my legs were literally numb 3 or 4 hours into the flight. We had to ask for extra blankets to provide at least a bearable level of padding and so did other passengers around us. Once the seat in front was reclined you could forget getting anything from the bag under your seat. In preparation for our return flight we have bought inflatable cushions. Inflight entertainment is below average, old films and very little else. Cabin service is also average, food was OK and attendants friendly, but a tiny cup full of wine was offered with dinner with a top up if you could catch the offer as it flew past on the trolley. That we could live with, but I don’t recall any soft drinks being offered through the night although there was a tray of drinks in the galley if you could manage to prise yourself out of your tiny seat which wasn’t ever going to be more than once or twice due to the unavoidable disturbance caused to passengers around you.

Everything was designed to maximize passenger comfort and space. The details of the seat were well thought out with lots of space and shelves to hold your stuff. The seat was the most comfortable I have experienced for sleep - wider and lie flat surface longer than any other so far. The pillow was plush and large and the blanket thick and warm. PJs and a thin mattress also available if desired. I had no trouble sleeping well on our over night flight, despite lots of turbulence. The food service included dinner and a breakfast just before arrival. I chose Chinese style cuisine for both and they were delicious. Food presentation was excellent. EVA paid attention to little details, for example, chopstick and spoon holders were an elegant touch. The young ladies / FA did amazing job. They worked super hard and served with a smile despite same shift for 14 hours. The amenity kit was placed in a Rimowa silver container - very nice.

EVA Air is probably the best Asian airline I've ever flown. Their ground service in Hong Kong and Vienna were impeccable. It was no hassle to check-in my slightly overweight backpack from Vienna to Taipei (I had a one day layover) instead of tagging it all the way to Hong Kong. Also, they know how to handle delays well - my outbound flight from Hong Kong to Taipei was delayed due to bad weather but the EVA Air staff were able to handle the situation by providing refreshments before boarding. Service on board is probably on par with that of a 5-star restaurant or hotel on the ground. No complaints, lots of smiles on the faces of the crew, great attention and care, and a very friendly attitude to the passengers. The food on board all my flights was delicious and I really appreciate their regular hot coffee/tea service on the long-haul sectors of my ticket. Decent movie selection on board as well, and the seats on the 777s were really comfortable for the transcontinental flights. If you're hungry, you can grab a snack from the counter at galleys or ask the cabin crew for help. WiFi was a bit expensive though so I didn't purchase any of their plans.

"""definitely recommend EVA""",9,J Michaels,27th April 2017,"✅ Verified Review | On my first flight from Manila to Taipei the agent at the counter in Manila was kind enough to upgrade me to premium economy at no cost. During my second flight from Manila to New York JFK I was in the regular economy cabin. Being this my first experience with EVA I was not sure what to expect but I booked because their 5 star rating here. During my first flight (Manila to Taipei - 2hrs) I received a hot meal (rice, meat, and vegetables), fresh fruit, a hot roll with butter, cake, wine, juice and water. No US carrier provides a meal like that on a two hour flight unless you are in business class or above. During my second flight (Manila to NYC - 14hrs) I received two hot meals (rice, meat, shrimp, vegetables, and pasta) fresh fruit, hot rolls with butter, dessert, wine, juice, water, snacks and 2 ham and cheese sandwiches. That is what I chose from the menu that we had in economy. Yes they hand you a menu with multiple choices and it's also displayed on the interactive screen you have in front of you. Their interactive entertainment choices are decent however for the 14 hour flight a more ample selection of movies would have been nice. The bathrooms in the economy cabin were equipped with amenities like you find in the business cabin bathrooms. Soap, lotion, body mist, facial mist, toothbrush, and sleeping masks were available in the bathrooms. On your chair you found a very nice and comfortable pillow with a blanket plus over the headphones. Next time I fly EVA I will book the premium economy cabin because the seat is extremely comfortable, double patted and a bit wider. (I'm 180lbs. 5'9"") plus they separate the cabin with curtains giving you the feeling of a less crowded space. The seat in the regular economy cabin was comfortable however any seat that you spend 14 hours on at some point will become uncomfortable and I found myself having to stand multiple times during the flight. I had an aisle seat. My only observation as constructive feedback would be that even though everyone onboard smiled, happiness must appear to be genuine and that genuine feeling was not properly transmitted by the flight attendants. On the other hand I must say that they worked extremely fast, efficiently, and professional. I flew the Boeing 777-300ER for both flights and I have to say that it was not as quiet as the Boeing 787 and both planes while clean had signs of wear and tear.

Another advantage is that the cabin is divided in two smaller sections, thus limiting circulation and noise.

EVA Air is undoubtedly an efficient and well run operation, with pleasant staff at the check-in at BKK through to a tad less pleasant flight attendants. Leg room and seats were more spacious than the average Economy class, though it does look a bit dated. Food was disappointing, though not especially bad. The selection of movies was very mediocre for long haul. Despite everything being perfectly reasonable about the flight, it was one of those horrible flying experiences that left me grasping for sanity. Not really the flight attendants fault, but some particularly poor parenting to the rear of me, saw a toddler terrorize the entire flight by screaming and/or running around the cabin. This was book ended by a newly born infant adding to the cacophony at the front.

I am so glad I did! The planes were new, which made a lot of difference for air quality on a long-haul flight. The seats were much more comfortable than that of Cathay Pacific Premium Economy. They were wider and could lean back much more. There were plenty of flight attendents who responded to requests promptly and always with a smile. They also kept the toilets clean and well-supplied throughout the long flight. The food choice was excellent, and meals were tasty. The service was top-notch. All attendants were polite and attentive. I had a slight stomach problem when flying back. The nice attendant noticed that I skipped meals.

After I went through TSA I realized I had left my cell phone at the counter, and I frantically ran back to the check-in counter and the check-in staff held it for me. I believe ORD to TPE is a new route and the EVA gate staff still has a few things to work out, boarding was a bit chaotic, even though they called by zones, several people pushed past those of us lined up by zone. On the plane, it was a mostly good 15 hour trip. I believe EVA has improved its catering because both my meal choices were terrific — the chicken with rice dinner was delicious and the morning breakfast scrambled eggs and bacon was amazing — it seems to be tough for any airline to do eggs well, but EVA got it right. A plus is that we were served with silverware and that elevated the experience. Unfortunately, throughout the 15 hours the cabin was just too warm. I asked the passenger seated at the aisle near me if he felt warm and he agreed it was hot (and he was wearing shorts). I asked the FA if she was able to lower the temperature a bit, and 20 minutes later, it was not as warm, but the temperature in the cabin never approached comfortable and I could not sleep during the flight. The odd part is I walked back through the Economy section a few times during the flight to stretch my legs and those cabins were so much cooler and almost everyone was asleep. The FA for my section seemed a bit distracted and forgot to bring my drink order even after the person next to me was served drink orders twice.

Check in at Bangkok airport was easy and quick - EVA occupied the whole R row and there was no queue. Boarding 10 minutes behind schedule but it was well organised as they called passengers by zone. The flight itself was around 85% full in Elite class. There was a bottle of water on the seat as well as ear phone and amenity pack and slippers - a typical EVA standard for Elite class. Menu was distributed after boarding. The two cabin crew in charge of the Elite class were probably the most professional crew I've encountered. They were friendly, smiley, efficient and enthusiastic. The Thai and Taiwanese Crew worked well as a team. I even think the service was one step above my favorite SQ.

The online booking is pretty straight forward but I wish they allow passengers to edit their profile and input passport information prior to check in. I checked in online 24 hours before departure and dropped my luggage at Heathrow. There is never a queue for Elite class passengers which is a plus. Boarding was on time. The plane was 8 years old and has just been refurbished - new seats for Elite class as well as new entertainment system. Personally I think the entertainment system is decent - the screen is large with good resolution, but the programme is limited, and the flight map is not interactive.  I prefer the old seat as it felt more comfortable. However the advantage of the new seat is that the chunky entertainment box has now been removed. They have upgraded the amenity pack but it was just the packing that is changed. Service on this flight was the biggest disappointment. The crew serving my area did not smile once - not a typical EVA standard. Food and wine were ok although I sensed some cost cutting this time. The flight was pretty smooth and we landed on time.

"""flight itself was lovely""",6,M Edwards,16th November 2016,"✅ Verified Review | London to Taipei via Bangkok with EVA Air. I have mixed feelings about this trip; I cannot fault the actual flight itself, because it was genuinely wonderful, but there were some issues with all other parts of the trip. During booking, for example: I only realised that there would be a stopover in Bangkok after I'd paid for the ticket (the flight was advertised as 'direct to Taipei' with no mention of the fact that there would be a 40 min technical stop). Technically correct, yes, but I wish the EVA Air website had made it clearer during booking. It was also very difficult to find out whether or not we would need to change plane. Boarding at Heathrow: my first time at Terminal 2, it seemed rather hectic. I have the EVA Air app on my phone and had my boarding pass on there, but 3 hours before going to the airport, the QR code disappeared from the app, so I needed to do check-in again to obtain a paper boarding pass. No directions were given during the technical stop/transfer in Bangkok - I just followed a couple whom I heard speaking Chinese - needed to go through security again, but otherwise no problems, BKK airport was lovely, free WiFi. Final issue: I somehow managed to earn 0 miles on this trip, even though there was nothing particularly 'saver' about my booking (sometimes the inflexible, cheaper bookings are not given very many air miles, but even then 25% is the minimum I should have expected). The flight itself was lovely - comfortable seat in economy, the food was delicious (we were given a menu, and the alcohol selection was great), cabin crew incredibly polite and friendly, everything (even the bathrooms) very clean, in-flight WiFi (a bit expensive, but works well - it cut out for about 2-3 hours while we were flying over India, though), good entertainment system.

"""business class product is great""",7,V Blaxell,18th October 2016,"✅ Verified Review |  Singapore to Taipei. EVA Air's hard business class product is great. I love the reverse herringbone seat layout of 1-2-1 which means that my window seat was angled toward the windows so I could look out with getting a neck ache. The seat is fully flat, highly adjustable, and really enormously comfortable although the footwell area for fully flat is a tad confined and the seat itself is quite narrow. There is quite a lot of storage space but none of it very useful since one is not permitted to stow anything in it for take off and landing, and there is no floor level storage for the carry-on, unlike the Singapore Airlines business class product which allows me to put my quite big carry on in an alcove near my feet. The color scheme is very nice, and the whole finish is excellent. As for the soft product: not so much. The FAs were attentive but their English and Japanese language skills were really limited. They were not proactive when it came to service. I had ordered the main course online and since the appetizer looked great and tasted even better, was looking forward to it, in as much as one can look forward to airline food. When the FA brought my main, it was ghastly. I left my fork standing up in the mess, and you know, the FA came by to refill my wine several times and never once inquired about the main course which sat there the whole time. I could have asked her to take it away and bring something else, but I thought I'd see how long it went on. Nothing happened. After a while she came and took it away and replaced it with a dessert selection which was as good as the appetizer. In my experience on Singapore Airlines and ANA in business, the FA would notice the mess sitting there uneaten and do something about it without being asked.  I'm flying with them again in a few days, so we shall see if  the food is better, and if the FAs see service problems without being told and deal with them.",Boeing 777-300ER,Business,Business Class,SIN to TPE,October 2016,4.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,4,yes

For the first time, my wife and I flew with EVA Air from Toronto to Manila via Taipei.

The flight was fully booked, however, the staff who checked us in was able to arrange for my wife and I to be seated next to each other. The flight departed on time, and about and hour and a half later dinner was served. Having flown Premium Economy previously with fellow Star Alliance member carriers Air Canada and Turkish Airlines, I was expecting more from EVA or at least something similar to what AC and TK have. That EVA serves meals to its Premium Economy passengers using plastic utensils was a letdown to begin with. While the meals maybe considered satisfactory, drinks were served in child-sized plastic cups including the wine which for some may be somewhat unappealing. Overall the impression I got was that there was no real difference between Premium Economy and Economy except for the extra leg and shoulder space. Choice of movies wasn't that up to date.

The only minor downsides I will mention are that drinks are limited, water, soft drinks and alcohol. The flight attendants come round at limited times and then you are only offered a small amount! My recollection of this flight was of being very dehydrated. Take bottled water on board with you. The in flight entertainment boxes are intrusive and on over half of the seats in economy you lose at least half of your leg room - so whilst they technically have great leg room, it depends on where you sit. Check the airlinequality seat plans and try and book a good seat in advance (if you can) - which leads me onto the online booking system which would not allow us to login (at any time) to select our seats and we ended up being allocated 15 rows apart, which was quite stressful.

On-line check-in is easy and fast, and then it is just a matter of dropping the bag at the Royal Laurel counter. The Aspire lounge for EVA AIR passengers (shared with a number of airlines) is excellent - and now that renovation at Schiphol is progressing, also better accessible; however, it is quite a distance from the usual EVA Air Gate G5. Boarding is orderly, and after the preliminaries (champagne, amenity kit, cold towel) the plane took off on time. Inflight service is great - staff anticipate your needs, catering quality high level (including the option to choose your meal in advance - which I did, and I enjoyed a delicious lobster thermidor). Strikingly, all cabin staff is female, and they are well trained. Friendly, service oriented and confident. The staff regularly checks for passengers' needs. Flight captains provide useful information. With the great lay out of the cabin, I get a good nights sleep and arrived rested in Bangkok, 40 minutes ahead of schedule. Business class provides a full size toilet where you can easily change into the pyjamas provided. ",Boeing 777-300,Business,Business Class,AMS to BKK,July 2016,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5,yes

Personally, I feel EVA Air is one of the best airlines in Asia. Flights from North America to Taiwan usually takes sometime between 12 to 15 hours. The seat in Premium Economy was pretty decent. I cannot say that it was the best ride because the seat cushions were quite hard. The food was good.

"""our best flight""",9,T Smith,30th May 2016,"✅ Verified Review | Los Angeles to Tapei with EVA Air. Unusually for EVA our flight was 30 minutes late taking off and we arrived about 40 minutes late due to congestion at TPE. Ticketing and boarding at LAX was quick and efficient. The flight itself was fine and there was great AC throughout the flight. We noticed several new small amenities - a cool towel to refresh was offered, eye shades, tooth brush and ear plugs were available in the lavatory, which was maintained and fairly clean the entire 14 hour flight. EVA catering seems to be experimenting with the menu and offering updated menu items. I did not care for the tuna snack or the pasta meal, but the chicken roll and fruit tasted fresh. The FA ran out of the beef meal my husband requested by the time she served our row but she made sure he received his first choice for the second meal. We tried the melon and plum liqueur, both were sweet and bracing. Our FAs were kind and attentive, smiling and worked consistently to make the experience more comfortable throughout the flight.

"""I loved EVA Air""",10,Gerri Sussman,26th May 2016,"Los Angeles to Singapore return via Taipei with EVA Air. The flight took off at 12:30 am, dinner service was abbreviated, which was fine. The cabin staff were all truly lovely and cared about our comfort. I preordered my meal online and was impressed with the service. The food was beautifully presented. As far as the complaints about the food, I would disagree. It's still plane food and I though everything was fine. The seat pod was very comfortable and felt very private. It took a little while to get myself organized in the space, since there was a lot of nooks and crannies in which to store your things. After playing with the many seat buttons, you are really able to put the seat in any position to get comfortable. The entertainment system was very good with the noise canceling headphones. There was an extensive selection of current movies of all genres. Mood lighting from pink to purple to twinkling stars help set the mood for sleep. I always used the forward bathroom for which there was never a wait. Bathrooms were immaculate any time I went in. I enjoyed the Rimowa kit, PJ's, and slippers. I was able to sleep a solid 5 hours and I'm sure I dozed from time to time as well. I loved seeing the plane travel route with the current time of LAX, duration left of the flight and time at destination. Arrived Taipei where I was really able to refresh in the lounge. A 2 hour layover and the a 4.5 hr trip to Singapore. I flew back with EVA Air on 5/12 from Shanghai to Taipei to LAX; Flights BR711, BR12. Another fabulous experience. I actually looked forward to the trip home. Best thing was I didn't experience jet lag either way! Totally amazing. Probably my only criticism would be the way the boarding process is handled. Although there are separate zones for business vs economy, I still felt it was pretty much a cattle call since everyone is lining up in their labeled zones. Felt a little like flying SouthWest. But I loved EVA Air! If you can possibly fly business class, go for it! It wasn't cheap but worth every dollar.

"""a pleasant flight experience""",9,W Robert Kmen,18th May 2016,"✅ Verified Review |  Even though Taipei to Hong Kong is a vary short flight, the onboard service, was quite good. There was a full meal service, and if you checked-in on line, there is a broad range of alternative meals you can choose if you don't want to take your chances with the standard coach class meal. On the outbound flight I rolled the dice and ended up not eating the curried fish that was served. Today I pre-ordered a fruit plate that was quite satisfactory. The Boeing 777's that EVA uses on some of the TPE-HKG flight are configured in 3 classes: business, premium economy and economy. They only sell two classes, so if you reserve early enough, you can select a premium economy seat at no extra charge. Check in for Star Gold was friendly and efficient, and boarding was disciplined and orderly. There is a large selection of AVOD options, and the seat-back screens are large and clear.

Upon arrival at the airport, we were handed our boarding passes and my excitement began. Walking to the gate, we thought it was strange that the standard green EVA Air plane was waiting to be boarded, and not the Hello Kitty 'Love Apples' Jet as advertised. I made a query with two EVA Air staff members who informed me that the interior of the plane was Hello Kitty but the exterior was not, as they told me 'the airline choose to switch the jets sometimes'. As you can imagine, we were left disappointed and cheated as we had paid a lot of money to get the full Hello Kitty experience. There are many other airlines that travel this route that are much cheaper at much more convenient times. However, we had booked the Hello Kitty Jet specifically. Boarding the plane, we also noticed that the Hello Kitty interior was very limited and not what is advertised online that we had booked and expected to find. We merely experienced a pillow, seat cover, cutlery and a pack of playing cards. On the Hello Kitty Jet website, there is much more Hello Kitty branded interior advertised. If we had known the jet wouldn't be the same as advertised online then we wouldn't have booked it, due to the high price.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,TPE to FUK,April 2016,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1,no

We found we had no inflight entertainment in our block of 3 seats. I ended up sitting in darkness for pretty much the whole trip as we had to draw the shutters shortly after taking off - in the middle of the afternoon. We were told to do this by one of the stewardess. The cabin crew did their best by trying to reset the inflight system but they had no success, but it was a long way to travel without entertainment. After getting back to the UK, I reported the problem to EVA and my wife and I were offered $50 compensation each, together with a form to sign. I appreciate EVA has no legal requirement to compensate us for such a dreadful service but their compensation offer was in the wrong currency for us - we use sterling and it was in the form of EVA tokens with a deadline of 1 year from issue. So it wasn't compensation at all. It was an offer to fly with EVA again in the next year for about £30 each less than we would otherwise have to pay - or nothing - so we rejected it.

"""a great flight experience""",10,N Huawei,10th April 2016,"✅ Verified Review |  Taipei to Istanbul with EVA Air. Check vin at TPE was a breeze. The checkin staff were welcoming, I was very promptly checked in and explained where the lounge is. The crew greeted me onboard and showed me to my seat, assisting with my luggage and stowing it away for me. I was offered a welcome drink, newspapers, pajama set, amenity kit, a beautiful and cute little Rimowa kit with Harnn toiletries, toothbrush and socks. There were also very comfortable slippers. The Business cabin is a 1-2-1 layout, and offers a fully lie-flat bed with great privacy and lots of personal space. There is a large touch-screen AVOD, noise-canceling headphones with hours of movies and audio selection. Shortly after take off came the hors-d'oeuvres, accompanied with a glass of Krug Grandcuvee (Eva is famous for offering good quality bubbly in Business Class). The beefnoodle soup with accompanying condiments, vegetables and scallop was exquisite, and a taste of Taiwan. Bottles of water were offered and left next to the galley. Also available throughout the flight were assorted fruits, snacks (biscuits, chocolates, nuts and dried fruits! I had a great sleep, the crew had told me about the possibility of making a bed if I wanted to sleep, but I did not do this. Shortly after I woke up, a flight attendant asked if I wanted a snack. I ordered a burger, which came with potato wedges. Breakfast was a full meal, and I had ordered traditional Taiwanese congee with a variety of side dishes.  I also recommend their selection of Taiwanese oolong and teas. The washroom was very clean. The toiletries are Harnn. The crew were welcoming, warm and paid attention to detail. The only downside is that there is no wifi, but these appear to be gradually introduced into the long-haul fleet of Eva Air. Otherwise, a great flight experience by an attentive cabin crew, and a very smooth landing at my destination.

Prices are good and the flight times are perfect on each leg. I'd still recommend EVA but feel the quality of service has dropped. The planes on this route are starting to look a little tired inside. Films and music could be better. The food is never great on EVA and you are made to feel like you are begging for alcoholic beverages. The main issue tho is the quality of some passengers, maybe down to recent competitive prices. Noisy and rude, talking all night and opening blinds during sleep hours. The stewardesses for some reason will never ask these disruptive passengers to be quiet or close the blinds, so we all suffer light in the cabin/lack of sleep.

Flying out from LAX to TPE, the cabin was warm and on the return, this flight from TPE to LAX, was still too warm for my liking during the flight, just a few degrees lower would be great. The premium economy seats make the 12-15 hour flight a much better experience, there is room to move and power outlets at the seats. The big difference from economy to premium are the larger seats with more legroom, a small amenity kit, bottled water, a menu with more choices than economy, and earlier boarding time.

"""cheerful, efficient and eager""",8,Steven Tu,2nd January 2016,"Another mostly positive experience on EVA. For the 13 hour flight from Los Angeles to Taipei, if it is in your budget, it is worth to fly premium economy (EVA calls it Elite Class). We appreciated the bottle of water, newspapers, and small amenity kit (toothbrush, toothpaste, lip balm). I noticed a few upgrades since we flew EVA this past summer - larger entertainment screens (pretty much ipad-like), reduced size of entertainment boxes giving us more room to stretch our legs out. Good power options and USB port to watch your own shows. Wireless was available for a fee. The foot rest is still virtually unusable.  What I like most about EVA is that the flight attendants seemed to be assigned to a specific section - the attendant for our section was cheerful, efficient and seemed eager to help make the flight go more smoothly. She remembered my drink preferences and explained menu choices patiently in excellent English. I appreciated how quickly she collected our trays after the meal service. I usually fall asleep during the 13 hour fight but the cabin was warmer than I would prefer and I wish now that I had asked them to turn it down, instead I just hydrated myself. The flight was smooth, takeoff and landing, although we ran into headwinds that affected our air route. The pilot let us know this added 30-40 minutes to our flight. I used the restroom once and it was fairly clean, not spotless as on previous trips, but definitely looked after. The meals served on this flight were ok, the bread was hard/cold and the entrees, Chinese porridge, and chicken with rice, while filling, were not especially appetizing. EVA can update their meal variety. Also, EVA used to offer cups of hot ramen noodles as a snack, but not on this flight (I miss that), though they did offer small sandwiches and crackers, and the attendants came around often with tea, water or coffee. During the LAX check-in process, the attendant assisting us at EVA's front desk seemed bothered when I asked about the possibility of changing our two middle seats to middle/aisle for the return flight. “Ask in Taipei,” he brusquely replied, giving us back our passports/tickets and directing us away from the check-in counter.

"""an excellent airline""",9,Lawrence Cohen,31st December 2015,"Taipei to Toronto. In my opinion EVA Air is an excellent airline. The Boeing 777 business class seat is very spacious and comfortable. You are provided with a large pillow and thick comforter, a nice amenity kit, comfy PJ's and slippers. You can actually sleep comfortably in the pod. Food is an area EVA needs to improve. Meal service is provided at a good pace. I pre-ordered my meals via the Eva app but the food was overcooked and tasteless and breakfast equally poor. Large video screen with fair selection of movies.

The flight from Taipei to London was in the newer Royal Laurel cabin on a Boeing 777. This was awesome and again the food and service was excellent.

The transfers at TPE were efficient and clear. The quality of food was excellent. On the TPE-YVR it was a treat to be served two hot meals. If there was a point lacking, it was that drinks were only offered with the meal and not prior and nor after. Perhaps one is supposed to just ask.

"""EVA Air is a great airline """,8,S Nelson,4th December 2015,"Singapore to San Francisco via Taipei, my fifth time on EVA Air, once was in Royal Laurel class and that was outstanding. The rest have been in economy.  In terms of cabin comfort. I prefer EVA Air over Singapore. EVA's economy has an extra inch of legroom and being 6'2"" tall, every extra inch of space matters to me. Cabin service on EVA Air is very attentive and the flight attendants are quite pleasant and kept the plane as well as the restrooms, spotless. My only two complaints, and then only on these last two flight legs from Singapore to Taipei and Taipei to San Francisco deal with the food and the entertainment. Both my wife and I pre-ordered the seafood special meal for each of the flight segments. Each meal was essentially the same with pan-fried fish (though the fish did vary) and pasta noodles. Seafood meals on previous flights have included shrimp and scallops, so we were disappointed this time. The second complaint is with the IFE system, specifically the lack of selections. Now this may be more an indictment of Hollywood than EVA Air, but I found nothing to watch in either direction of this trip. (We left SFO in November and returned in December, so the movies changed). 14 to 16 hours on a plane is a long time with nothing to watch.

Easy process. Reservation office is manned during office hour and calls answered within 5 minutes. Check in and boarding at Heathrow Terminal 2 was smooth without any hassle. T2 was relatively quiet in late evening. EVA Air flight departs from the Satellite at T2 which is a long walk, so don't leave it to last minute. Plane was a 7 or8 year old Boeing 777-300. Nothing fancy but good leg room and clean (but warm) cabin. Amenity kits, bottled water and high quality blanket were provided upon boarding along with a menu. Dinner service started 1 hour into flight. Food was tasty and drinks were available. Not the best wine choice but it's sufficient. Ice cream was provided. Service was efficient although a bit robotic. Toilets were kept clean throughout the flight and the crew walked along with plenty of water and sandwich. Short stopover at BKK then continued to TPE. Disappointed that the flight map wasn't working properly so we had no update where we were. Return flight TPE to BKK was a 4 hour journey. Again service was efficient. Check in at TPE terminal 2 was very slow though. The airport simply couldn't cope. A week later Bangkok to London with the same equipment and service, with much better check in/bag drop experience in BKK airport (I used online check in which was easy). One of the weakness of EVA Air is the dated product and the poor entrainment system compared with SQ or CX. They are buying new Boeing 777 with new interior, wifi and better screen but not sure if the old stock will get renovated.

They accommodated special requests readily and English was universally spoken, smiles all around. The seat pitch on both 777 and 747 seemed better than most economy classes, I slept well. Slippers were provided. On the 747 upper deck window seats, storage lockers between the seat and fuselage are a nice convenience. Food was good to excellent, served with very firm and usable plastic cutlery. The ginger fish and pork and rice were the most memorable dishes. The only disappointment was the in-seat technology. No charging available, the entertainment system screen was smallish, felt very 2005. Movies and TV on the system would inexplicably cut out sometimes. The flight tracker played a loop of views showing the total fight path, then current location, etc, rather than being controlled by the user to see what you want.

Excellent EVA Air lounge in BKK with good selection of hot and cold foods. Flight departed on time. Champagne on board free flow. No wifi between BKK-TPE but excellent wifi speed between TPE to LAX. Ordered vegetarian oriental and was really tasty. Lounge in TPE is quite crowded and the food is not as good as in BKK although they do offer Haagen Dazs ice cream. Inflight service is by name and attentive. Cabin crew are pleasant and quite strict in enforcement of inflight safety measures. Love the Harn amenities in the bathroom with facial mist. Rimowa amenity bag is legendary 180 degrees flat bed is remarkable. I wish the TV monitor was not put back to its back seat position during take off/landing as I miss out the last chunk of the movie.

EVA Air customer review,9,Taylor Voss,7th July 2015,"Eva Air to Bangkok from London Heathrow, on time and staff very helpful. The seating was a little cramped but other than that was comfortable. You get 2 meals and 2 snacks and all were very filling and tasty. The staff were very helpful and try their best to help you. The inflight service was very good with lots of options.

EVA Air customer review,8,Raphael Osuna,24th June 2015,"LAX-TPE-BKK, BKK-JFK via TPE. EVA is not a flashy airline, but a subtle service that will make your journey an easy and comfortable one.

EVA Air customer review,8,Bernard Brown,4th June 2015,We recently flew from San Francisco to Manila and back (April-May 2015). We chose the airline from the reviews we read and the price. Having flown US airlines recently and being totally unsatisfied this was a breath of fresh air. The seats were comfortable the service was prompt and cordial and the price was fantastic. Connections were easy. United you could sure learn something from these people. The only fault was the beverage service. We got a little cup of wine with our meal then never saw the beverage service again. Another glass or 2 would have been nice. But the overall service was excellent and we definitely will fly EVA again as we travel annually overseas.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,5,yes
EVA Air customer review,9,Stephen Lloyd,22nd May 2015,"I have flown on a variety of services to Bangkok from London over the last two years. I avoided using EVA until they joined Star Alliance. Based on the two trips this month I believe of the three direct carriers (EVA BA Thai) as they stand today (pre Thai A380) EVA offer the best business service. The seat is comfortable spacious and at 6'3"" tall I can sleep fully extended without having to bend my knees. It's a comfortable sleep with a reasonable duvet thrown in and fully flat. Service is nice and polite English fair and a decent screen to watch videos on. The music selection is poor and film selection fair only - there's better out there but there is enough for me to get through a 13 hour flight with sleep. Aircraft are modern and comfortable you actually get a sleep suit and good amenity kit which many no longer give. The only alternative (without taking a much longer route) I have used that competes on comfort is Austrian - but that's not direct.",,,Business Class,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,7,H Sajed,20th May 2015,YVR-TPE-BKK return. Outbound leg on March 30th and inbound on May 10th. Our YVR-TPE leg was delayed by an hour or so due to avionics failure on the B747. The captain and crew were very professional about it kept us informed of the reasons and troubleshooting progress as we waited on the tarmac. Other than that flight was very great for this leg and all other outbound and inbound legs. I found their cabin crew extremely professional courteous safety-oriented and well groomed. Inside the cabin the planes were clean and fresh. I had ordered Moslem Meal and to my delight the meals were very good quality on all flight segments. I wish they had used Airbus jets as I am not a fan of the 3-4-3 or 3-3-3 configurations (prefer to sit 2-4-2 on the side having two seats). EVA falls short on one thing - IFE. Their music collection can be vastly improved and widened. My first time with EVA and certainly won't be the last.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,,5,yes
EVA Air customer review,4,Wang Et,11th May 2015,BR10 May 3rd 2015. Traveled in their premium economy and was pleased so had greater expectations for their business class. Totally disappointed. It's the Taipei-Vancouver-Taipei section where they are still flying 747's. The seats in sleep mode were awful. Service was efficient and very business like but the food was awful! Also limited selection post main meal basically crackers. The bathroom was small. What was efficient was the luggage disembarkation. Very fast. Also very annoying was the announcements in three languages. They are frequent in English Mandarin and Taiwanese. Surely on international flights Taiwanese could be omitted to make announcements shorter especially when trying to sleep.,,,Business Class,,,2.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,,2,no
EVA Air customer review,6,G Afshar,5th May 2015,LHR-BKK-LHR. I have flown EVA to Bangkok in economy class over the last 6 years. The inflight service is getting worse every year food quality is terrible the crew are polite but act like robots. The inflight movie choices are poor I end up staring at the flight map. The positive things are the generous comfortable leg room within the cabin which is far better than other schedule flights departure times from both Heathrow / Bangkok and reasonable ticket fare in comparison to other Airlines operating direct flights to Bangkok.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,10,Dan Watts,26th April 2015,Flew Royal Laurel Class from Heathrow to Taipei. Brilliant. Flat bed better than BA and as good as Virgin Upper. Lots of space and comfort. Great choice of movies and big screen and the food was top notch. Cabin crew were extremely friendly and attentive throughout. Cant really fault it.

EVA Air customer review,6,John Westoby,19th April 2015,BKK-LHR-BKK in April 2015. Food on first sector BKK-LHR far better than return leg. Inflight entertainment poor compared to other airlines and very limited choice so on return flight not much to watch. On one of the seats for my family the sound for the inflight entertainment did not work for the sector LHR-BKK - luckily the flight was not full so could jump to another seat. In-flight announcements hopeless - one can hardly understand the English. LHR-BKK flight delayed by over 1.5 hours leaving T2. Flight crew very nice and helpful and friendly and are focused on their job for both sectors.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,8,P Wong,16th April 2015,HKG-TPE BR 858 A330-200 Hello Kitty Jet and TPE-HKG BR 857 777-300ER. Originally BR 857 is operated by Hello Kitty Jet same as BR858 but due to regular maintenance they switch it to 77W but Hello Kitty service still provided. Both seats are very comfortable very nice staff. The food served was just moderate no much design of Hello Kitty on their food served but the beverages served were better. Hello Kitty welcome video only shown on the flight to Taipei. The IFE of 332 has lower display quality the flight tracker stop working just 10 more minutes before landing IFE in 77W is better and operating properly. Selection of IFE can satisfy me in this 90 minutes flight. I would consider to travel with EVA Air next time.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,,4,yes

Asked for a beer 40 mins into return flight to be told ""No beer"" no smiles either. Cabin crew efficient and toilets kept spotless. Lack of refreshment in between meals needs addressing. Also what's with all the window blinds having to be kept closed on daylight flight. First and last time will pay a little more next time.",,,Economy Class,,,4.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,,3,no

EVA Air customer review,8,Thomas John Cooke,25th March 2015,Flew Business Class London-Brisbane on 2/2/15 returning on 18/3/15. This was our first experience with EVA and overall our experiences were positive. Staff were excellent and service was good. Food quality was variable. For example dim sum excellent but a beef rib meal was inedible. One small downside was the service of drinks. Despite an extensive drinks menu we were only offered a pre-meal drink on one occasion. The main benefit of EVA was the value for money. It compares well against our experience of other airlines but with the advantage of being cheaper.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,,5,yes
EVA Air customer review,8,H Vuong,19th March 2015,LAX-TPE-SGN (11 Mar 2015). Flying with EVA Air is always very pleasing. Check-in was like a flash at LAX. I came to the counter showed my passport and credit card and received my boarding passes within a minute! In-flight services were good however I was skipped getting served first round drinks during meal service. Woke up after a good sleep of over 6 hours and was invited to get some drinks and snacks. Flight attendants were kind and friendly. Connection at TPE was easy. Drinks were served during meals before collecting the trays on TPE-SGN and the last two hours were left without any drinks. I would suggest the drink services spread through the flight(s) or at least one more round of drink service should be in place half or one hour after meal service. Overall I am happy with EVA Air and will fly with them whenever possible/available.,,,Premium Economy,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,9,V Wallace-Jones,9th March 2015,"Just had our third EVA flight to Bangkok this time with our adult children and their partners. Flew Elite class out and economy back. As always we were impressed with the service. Seats in Elite are very comfortable and worth the small price increase especially for an overnight flight. We range in height from 5' 9"" to 6' 3"" and we all managed to sleep for over half the journey. Food was satisfactory - the vegetarian option is often just vegetables which is boring but they are cooked well and varied. Service is very good - drinks and snacks available throughout the flight either brought round at regular intervals by the cabin crew or on a 'help yourself' basis in the galley. Economy seats obviously offer less legroom and are slightly narrower but are perfectly adequate for a daytime flight. We will be returning to Thailand in the next 18 months and will once again travel Elite and Economy with EVA.",,,Premium Economy,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,8,John Peters,9th March 2015,Flew from Taipei to Vancouver in Business Class. Service by flight attendants was excellent. Drinks were offered prior to take-off and during the course of the flight. This is a night time flight which leaves around mid-night. Big drawback on the 747 is the seating which merely reclines rather than folding flat. Difficult to sleep unless medication taken. English spoken by the crew was acceptable and FAs friendly. Dinner meal much better than the Western breakfast.,,,Business Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,5,yes
EVA Air customer review,8,Robert Wilson,24th February 2015,Recent RT Flight Bangkok-London - Business Class. Overall a great choice especially compared to the other two non-stop options. The BKK-LHR flight was almost flawless. Comfortable seats on time good food and service. My only complaints were focused on the cabin service on the return leg. Staff seemed rushed and disjointed throughout the flight for no apparent reason. Meal courses were served prior to the earlier course being consumed. No cocktail orders were ever offered; had to ask for my dessert choice 3 times; forgot to give me pyjamas no fast-track passes were available. (All unlike the outbound leg). All minor issues but the cumulative errors made for a somewhat unpleasant experience.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,10,R Lingwood,18th February 2015,LHR to BKK return on Boeing 777Royal Laurel Business class. I normally fly with Thai but EVA offered a very competitive price so this was the first time I have flown with Eva Air and I was not disappointed in the least. Their 1x2x1 seating arrangement in my opinion rates amongst the best. Fully flat bed and generous space make for a very comfortable flight. I had window seats on both flights and you are virtually in a 'world of your own'. The food is good and well presented and you can choose from about eight options online prior to your flight. A good selection of drinks plus champagne is served regularly. I found the cabin crew very polite attentive and professional throughout the flights and they ensured the toilets were kept to an immaculate condition at all times. The entertainment offered was good and varied to suit most tastes with a generous sized screen. There is ample charging points for phones Ipads etc and good privacy reading lighting. Check in and boarding at both airports was quick and effortless and lounges at London and Bangkok were to a good standard. Overall I was very impressed with EVA's product and have already booked to fly with them again in a few months time.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes

EVA Air customer review,10,Richards John,30th January 2015,Royal Laurel class on a 777-300ER LAX-TPE and back. Amazing amount of space 1-2-1 layout means everyone has direct aisle access. Best sleep on a flight. Aircraft had the Boeing Sky interior which simulates a starry night sky and sunrise a nice touch. Service was good. Food was good. Some folks criticize the food but I only eat one of the meals anyway since I prefer to sleep and the meal was fine. United's BusinessFirst was 2-4-2 on the same airplane and cost $2000 USD more. Cathay has a similar but better business class product but their cost was $3500 more. Eva's Royal Laurel is the best bang for the buck across the Pacific.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,5,yes

Impressed by quality of cabin staff excellent and efficient service and the modern 777-300R aircraft. Food better than any other airline I have travelled with. Seats give valuable extra space over economy. However I am tall and the folding-out leg supports were not usable as my legs were too far forward to rest on them; a pity!

We were all ready to leave from Brisbane but due to an engine issue we were kept waiting onboard for 1.5 hours with insufficient explanation from the crew or captain about the situation. After this drama we left BNE. The crew were professional but not friendly at all. I felt they walked through the cabin in a big rush and bumped many passengers on their way. The meals were average but of good size. The ""Star Lounge"" at TPE was nice but was really crowded and there were limited showers so we couldn't get in. From Taipei to Kansai breakfast was served which was edible but again the crew were in a huge rush to get everything done.

EVA Air customer review,10,D Ford,19th January 2015,Bangkok - Heathrow. The return leg of my trip and just as on the outbound flight check in and boarding were fast and efficient. Cabin crew were excellent with a good level of English and were attentive without being intrusive. Toilets were spotless throughout the flight and well supplied with various lotions. The new amenity kit is of excellent quality. Departure was 10 minutes late and although the time was made up during the flight traffic at Heathrow (as always) very busy which resulted in a 25 minute late arrival.

EVA Air customer review,9,Len Sweetman,14th January 2015,Flew Brisbane to London 31st Dec. I would consider EVA the best airline I have flown with. The quality of every aspect of the flights was first class. Royal Laurel class was exceptional whilst the only thing to spoil the experience in Premium Laurel was the lie flat seat.

EVA Air customer review,10,D Ford,31st December 2014,London / Bankok in Royal Laurel Class. Flight delayed by 30 minutes due to ATC in London. From check in to boarding everything went smoothly the Air Canada lounge in T2 Heathrow was comfortable although fairly limited on choice of snacks there also need to be better signage for the lounge as it is tucked away through a small passageway and T2 staff working in the area did not know where it was. Onboard everything was as always immaculate excellent cabin crew who were friendly spoke good English and were attentive without being intrusive. I rarely sleep for more than two hours on a flight but after the meal that was served within an hour of takeoff I slept for seven hours. The lie flat bed excellent posture pillow and duvet made for a very good flight. I ordered my meals online as there is a wider selection and could not fault the quality or quantity. Baggage handing at Bangkok was quick and efficient and I was out of the airport within 30 minutes of landing. EVA has worked hard to produce an excellent product and value for money.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,0.0,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,8,P Hoyi,22nd December 2014,Taken HKG-TPE-HKG o/b 29 Nov i/b 1 Dec respectively for a leisure trip with my girlfriend. For the o/b flight it was a bit inconvenient due to configuration of MD-90. Seats and legroom were not wide enough. Moreover the headlamp on my girlfriend's seat was out of order so it was on the entire journey for 1.5 hours from HKG-TPE. Convenience is much better on the i/b flight as it was an A321. Flight meals on both journeys were excellent. I was mostly impressed by the perfect landing for i/b flight as it was raining heavily at Hong Kong on that day. The only demerit was no individual in-flight entertainment on both flights.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,5,yes
EVA Air customer review,10,K Mann,18th December 2014,LHR-BKK-LHR this was our first time with EVA as normally we fly Thai. I cannot emphasize how good this airline were. From start to finish they provided excellent service. The onboard service was efficient courteous and the food quality and amounts will have me returning to this airline on my next trip to BKK. The seats were comfortable (and unlike Thai) fully flat beds with quality duvet and pillows. Whilst the inflight movies were not extensive in choice there were certainly enough to keep me entertained.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5,yes

EVA Air customer review,8,Bellamy John,25th November 2014,Reading some of the past reviews we sometimes wonder what people want for their money. We selected EVA Air Premier Economy because they came out cheapest for our return LHR-BKK-LHR flight last month. And for what we paid both legs were excellent! Easy and quick check-ins at both airports punctual timings clean and newish aircraft smart and extremely efficient cabin crew (We don't care if they smile or not what we want to know is if we have to evacuate the airplane will the cabin crew be up to the task - that's their prime job!!). Yes the food is aimed at their predominant Asian customer base and why shouldn't it but we thought it OK - there was certainly enough of it and plenty of drink runs by cabin crew too. Well done EVA Air for giving us such value-for-money we will be happy to fly with you next time!,,,Premium Economy,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,5,yes
EVA Air customer review,8,Ward Jennfer,20th November 2014,I'm still at Bangkok airport waiting for my connecting flight  having just stepped off my economy Heathrow - Bangkok flight. Given some of the reviews on here I have to be honest - I was a little worried about the experience in advance. Honestly there was no need - the seats and leg room were great as was the food which was tasty and plentiful the crew couldn't have been nicer the toilets impeccable! It wasn't cold and the pillow and blanket were if good quality. This is a great airline more cost effective than Thai air or BA. I have no idea what all these people have to moan about! I would definitely use this airline again.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,4,yes

EVA Air customer review,10,D Jackson,20th November 2014,LHR-BKK November 2014 Economy. We last flew EVA in 1994 and the experience was a bit grim. I knew things had improved so was very keen to give them a try. Booked just 6 hours prior to departure on the Eva Air website - price £585 return (slightly cheaper than Thai who I also have flown with recently for comparison). A pleasant surprise and all in all a good flight. Positives - food quality superb I had a braised beef with noodles and vegetables. It was served with a warm roll two small side starters. Dessert was a stodgy cheese cake but filling. I declined coffee and tea. Frequency of soft drinks excellent and help yourself tray of water orange and apple juice was available at the back including mini Coronation Chicken Rolls Taiwanese snacks and biscuits. Toilets were clean and the staff did numerous cleans throughout. Staff were polite attentive and efficient. B777-300 very clean and only a few years old. Seats - great plenty of space to move. Negatives - film and music selection on the IFE very poor. A pleasant experience will definitely fly them again. They fly from LHR new terminal 2 and that is superb.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,5,yes

EVA Air customer review,9,T Eldem,17th November 2014,YYZ-TPE-YYZ on B777-300. Smooth check-in and orderly boarding using priority and zone-based boarding. Both flights departed on time and landed ahead of schedule The reverse herringbone style lie-flat seats were very comfortable and offered ample storage. Plush duvet large pillow amenity kit and pyjamas made the long journey even more comfortable I selected my main course in advance via their website and the food was nicely presented and tasty. The wine selection was limited although the overall beverage offering had plenty to choose from including freshly brewed cappuccino. The IFE had a good selection of current movies and audio programs. There was a wide array of snacks to choose to from throughout the flight and the very attentive and personable FA's ensured passengers were well cared for. The cabin temperature was maintained at a very comfortable level and the bathrooms were kept spotless throughout the journey. The starry ceiling when the lights were dimmed was a nice touch. Overall a terrific experience and a great product.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,5,yes

EVA Air customer review,10,J Marissa,11th November 2014,Traveled from LHR to TPE in Royal Laurel class (B777). Right from the get-go the service was excellent from check-in to touch down. They provided me with lounge passes at Heathrow T2 for the Maple Club and EVA Air's lounge in Bangkok (short stopover). The food was good with a fair amount of selection and the wine choices were limited but fine. Movies selection was a little limited in part because they need to cater to their own country as well. The seat was a lie flat and I had plenty of room to stretch out; layout is 1-2-1. Overall the service was better than United and even compared to United's Global First I would say the class I traveled in was better. For one thing seats weren't crammed in. Although I got the ticket on reward points I would say EVA Air is very cost competitive. I'd be happy to fly this airline again.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,5,yes
EVA Air customer review,8,Eddie Ng,3rd November 2014,KUL-TPE. Have taken EVA Air a few times and it delivers good service so far. Crew are polite - not the most friendly but I have flown most Asian airlines and not single airline has 100% friendly crew. Important is that they are helpful and prompt. Legroom is good for Econ Class - beware some IFE boxes under the front seat so it may interfere some legroom. Overall cabin cleanliness is 8/10. Food is inclined towards Asian choices which happen to be my favourite. Definitely look forward to fly EVA next Jan from Singapore to New York.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,5,yes
EVA Air customer review,8,D Finden,31st October 2014,VIE-BKK-TPE in business class on A332. Lie flat seats and cabin were a bit worn but comfortable. Entertainment was interactive and selection decent. Ground service in Vienna was fine. Flight crews were excellent and attentive. Food was decent and plentiful for all 3 meals on this flight sequence. Stop-over in BKK went fine was not entirely made clear that you had to re-clear security but you got there one way or another. Lounge availability for stop-over at BKK a real plus. Flights on time. Would be nice to see J cabin improved to be more competitive but overall a good flight.,,,Business Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
EVA Air customer review,9,Stewart Vare,28th October 2014,JFK-TPE-JFK in Elite Class. 15 hour flight going 14 hours returning 29 hours total therefore I was concerned how I would enjoy these long flights. However with EVA there was no need to worry. Both flights were excellent in what seems like a new 777-300ER. Elite class was a good choice separate cabin and toilets wider comfortable seats with a foot rest and enough entertainment choices for 30 hours flying. Food agreeable to all tastes due to the variety and pleasant enough. There must have been about 20+ staff I guess they work in shifts. Press the call button and you'll have two of them at your seat in less than a heart beat. Only problem the English could be better to speak and understand. However overall I'd do this flight with EVA agin given the opportunity.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,5,yes
EVA Air customer review,5,Steve Rutsch,22nd October 2014,We flew Economy from AMS to BKK. The air-conditioning blew very cold air on both flights we had with EVA. We fly very often and know how the temperature should feel like. Although we asked the flight attendants to change the temperature and made them aware of all the other passengers that needed jackets and shawls they didn't really care about our problem. I also think like many others here that EVA tries to lower the costs by putting on a cold airco. So take a hat a winter jacket and thick socks with you if you decide with EVA Air. Another problem is that under many seats there a steal boxes (I think they are the entertainment boxes for the screens) so that you don't have enough space for your seats. Very uncomfortable. We could further not check in online and when we arrives esrly at the check in we were both times told that we couldn't sit together although we had booked months in advance. Very bad service! The crew looks like the Chinese Army with their dark green uniform and their hair cuts and they lack a kind of warmth and interest in their guests. I hope that these problems will also be read by EVA Air so that these things will change. The food was okay but the drinks were served in half full plastic glasses.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,,3,no
EVA Air customer review,10,F Wong,20th October 2014,BR35 from YYZ to TPE. Having flown on BR36 I expected BR35 to be just as good and guess what? It was even slightly better! The usual smile and enthusiasm are very welcoming indeed. Lovely duvet and pillow also provided with pyjamas and RIMOWA bag. New style flat bed very comfortable had a good 6 hours of sleep. Food was excellent plenty of drinks and alcohol choices. It was lovely to wake up and be asked if I wanted some Chinese steamed dim sum for snacks a very attentive touch. Toilets are spacious and kept spotlessly clean throughout the flights. The 14 hours went by like a breeze. With competitive ticket prices EVA will be high on my list for long haul flights.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,10,H Justin,20th October 2014,TPE to CGK economy class. The check-in process was time-consuming as it was part of the holiday weekend in Taiwan spent over an hour in the chaotic Taoyuan airport as a result of long queues and complicated processes to proceed checking bags. Other than that the seats were the comfiest I've been on with great leg room (though no foot rest) and the flight attendants constantly walking down the aisle were the nicest. Ask them to refill your water and they will comply to your request. Food was incredibly tasty for an airplane meal with the salad being refreshing the bread warm and the beef very tender. Inflight entertainment was decent as quite a wide selection was displayed though not as complete as SIA. Overall a good airline that deserves more publicity due to its excellence.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5,yes

EVA Air customer review,10,F Wong,12th October 2014,HKG to TPE to YYZ HKG to TPE on an A330 great service and food staff are keen and pleasant. Extremely impressed with the lounge in TPE great shower room and wide range of food offered in their new lounge. On route to Toronto on their new 777 Royal Laurel Class their new signature product. Exactly same design as CX very private and full of storage space. When laid flat one could sleep very comfortably. Service is once again excellent even better than from HKG which was already very good. Food was fabulous and plenty in portion. Loved their pyjamas and Rimowa toiletry case probably amongst the smartest and most collectible I had a very enjoyable 13 hours on this flight arrived fresh very pleased to have chosen EVA to fly me to Toronto.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,3,yes
EVA Air customer review,8,Wang Po H,12th October 2014,"LAX-TPE in Elite class September 2014. Nothing out of the ordinary for me as I have flown this route in the past six years on EVA Air. Consistent service during the last few years. However on my most recent trip I noticed a deterioration of quality of meals served. Seems EVA Air has disappointingly gone back to their cost-saving ways again at the expense of their customers which is not good news. In 2013 I was surprised and happy to find increased attention paid to quality and quantity of meals served in Elite class. Not the case anymore sad to say. Airlines don't think their customers notice it when they cut back in certain areas but they do! On my trip in June 2014 I flew in one of EVA's newer ""Hello Kitty"" planes from TPE-LAX. Big difference in the arm/leg space even in Elite class with more pitch and better recline not to mention ample leg room. If you are one of the lucky ones to fly in their ""Hello Kitty"" planes between LAX-TPE you're in luck! EVA is still recommended but their star seems to be waning for me as they cut back in areas that they shouldn't be when it comes to the traveler.",,,Premium Economy,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,,M J Wraight,28th September 2014,LHR-BKK. Pre flight customer service was appalling check in was OK we were not able to sit together as a family of 4 so had to sit separately. Plane was OK leg room was good TVs did not work so had to endure a 12 hour flight without working entertainment cabin crew tried to assist but would have meant my 5 year old son sitting on his own!

EVA Air customer review,5,Nesbitt Paul,19th September 2014,"LHR-BKK For the first time with the ""New"" business class I was a little disappointed. The whole service seemed rushed no pre dinner drinks or nibbles and straight in to dinner which was disappointing to say the least. Tandoori Prawns with a ""blue gel"" and raw peppers followed by a pre-ordered steak that was well done and flavorless. I really hope this was the exception that proves the rule as I have been using Royal Laurel for some months BKK-LHR-BKK and this is the first bad experience I have had.",,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,5,Maureen Verrier,9th September 2014,Trail Finders booked me EVA Air to Bangkok. The aircraft was noisy which made following the inflight entertainment difficult. The choice of films was poor also. The cabin crew were polite. They spoke English with a very strong accent so it might as well have been Chinese. To be fair economy seating was good and the aisle was a good width. The return journey was in elite. It appeared to be a newer plane and the inflight entertainment choice was better as the aircraft was not so noisy I could follow the films. Still a language problem with crew.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,,2,no
EVA Air customer review,9,F Price,6th September 2014,We travelled from London to Bangkok return with young children in economy class. The legroom was good for economy. The plane was full. Staff were friendly and did a good job. The food was edible and we had pork with noodles going and chicken stir fried rice for main meals. There were snacks and non alcoholic drinks available whenever you wanted them although more hot drinks would have been nice. The inflight entertainment was excellent with a choice of games and recent blockbuster films. The children were very happy and kept occupied. Most importantly it was a direct flight EVA being one of a handful of airlines including Thai airways and BA who fly direct between the UK and Thailand saving a minimum of 2-3 hours on the journey time. Overall good value for money for the same price as some indirect flights. Have used them several times before and will use them again.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,5,yes

EVA Air customer review,9,Tercon Bojan,14th August 2014,The 777-300ER on this short 3 hour 30 minute regional route from Saigon to Taipei had a complete lie-flat bed which is impressive. I imagine this is the same configuration they also use for long-haul flights. The seat layout in Royal Laurel (biz) class is a reverse herringbone which is actually much better than a traditional herringbone configuration. At least you face into the window and not the aisle. The service was ok but sub-par for An Asian airline. I also feel that they have to do a big revamp of their branding for the greens that they use for their corporate colours is very drab! When it came to meal time they brought all the 3 main courses to display to you so that you could make a choice. It was like looking at a photo menu which I kind of liked. You didn't have to guess what you were ordering. All-in-all a very comfortable connecting flight.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,,5,yes
EVA Air customer review,1,Hartanto Mo,14th August 2014,EVA changed to A321 (single aisle) for a 5 hours long flight. (Usually used for HKG-TPE). The business class seat could not fully reclined and no leg rest. A far cry from the previous A330 used (laurel class). This is an international flight. Surabaya - Taipei - Surabaya. Midnight flight as well. Saving costs on aircraft but at the cost of the passenger's comfort. The flight attendants however were very attentive even after working 2 shifts: TPE-SUB-TPE. Excellent service but very bad flight comfort for a long 5hrs journey.,,,Business Class,,,1.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,,3,no
EVA Air customer review,9,Tercon Bojan,14th August 2014,The business class seat on this 777-300ER flight from Taipei to San Francisco has a reverse herring bone layout which I've never flown in. Am not a fan of the traditional herringbone layout but a reverse formation is much better for you face into the window and do not see any other passengers since you're facing away from them. It nearly feels like you're sitting in a recliner chair facing a window with a moving view while drinking champagne. The downside is that it's difficult to get out of the seat if you're sleeping or reclining. Also if you really want to see what's happening outside you have to awkwardly bend towards the window to get closer to the view. The service is somewhat uncompetitive to the other Asian airlines. The branding is old and stale. The green colour of the livery looks too much like a shipping company - EVA Air is an affiliate of Evergreen Shipping Line - and the green of the uniforms looks overly utilitarian. I did enjoy the food menu except for the Wolfberry jelly and the IFE had a considerable amount of entertainment options. The crew also offered a pyjama on this 12 hour flight which is always a good idea. What impressed me though was the very unique Rimowa toiletry bag - shaped like a mini Rimowa suitcase.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,,5,yes
EVA Air customer review,10,D Stanley,27th July 2014,I am reviewing the customer service more than the actual flight. Seems there's enough about that here already anyway but for the record the flight was ok. I needed to make changes to my ticket in Hanoi which is a dicey process as service in Vietnam is spotty at best but the local office had good service with English speakers answering the phone and taking care of my changes with no problems. When I got to the airport I had lost my credit card (must show purchasing card at check in) and had to buy a new ticket. They ran me to the business office upstairs and used the computer to buy a ticket for a month away at the same prices with the plan that they would move the ticket date at the check in counter. In my haste I misspelled my own name and this caused a real problem when transferring the ticket. The ladies at the counter worked on it and got me on the plane with minutes to spare. Stressful but my own fault. I was told that I could apply for a refund of my original ticket online which turned out not to be true because of the original reissue / changes I made. Turns out the refund would have to be worked out with the Hanoi office. When I mentioned that this would be hard as I was staying in San Francisco the woman at the San Francisco ticketing office said she could handle it if I faxed her some information which I did. That was yesterday and she just called back telling me the refund was being processed. So great help from the Hanoi office at check-in and in San Francisco!,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,,5,yes
EVA Air customer review,8,Farel Silalahi,17th July 2014,CKG-SFO return. Excellent flight in Elite Class for the TPE-SFO section. The food on the TPE-CKG flight little too bland. Movie choice not extensive. But overall an excellent flight experience.,,,Premium Economy,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,9,Taylor Ling,12th July 2014,KUL-SFO return. It was a great experience! It's my first time with EVA Air and I think they did the job well for economy class - no problem whatsoever during the whole flight. Plane was slightly old and it was OK. If you stop by Taipei Airport and have some time walk around it because each boarding gate has a different theme and get your free massage chair token from the information counter to relax in the green zone. Overall I would recommend taking EVA Air - I suppose Premium and Business class will be even more enjoyable.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,9,R McDonald,6th July 2014,22/12/13 BKK-LHR. We had a last minute change of airline from Thai to EVA Air. Weren't we the lucky ones. We were in business class and I could not fault the service and the food was some of the best I have had in the air. I ordered steak and it was the most perfectly cooked steak medium rare. The cabin crew were very attentive and filled glass with out being asked. Good variety of wine. The seat was very comfortable although quite far apart if traveling as a couple (I was) marking conversation a little difficult but this is only a small niggle. I would fly with EVA again.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5,yes
EVA Air customer review,10,I Suttie,6th July 2014,I am a regular passenger on EVA Air flying from LHR-BKK-LHR in their Business Class. The recent changes from almost flat to full recline with their seating is a definite improvement. I sleep a little on these but never did on the older style seats. The cabin crew are always polite professional and friendly. The lounges at both LHR and at BKK are comfortable and serve a good selection of food and beverages. The aircraft's are clean and well equipped with amenities.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,5,yes
EVA Air customer review,1,J Cowburn,3rd July 2014,We have flown EVA Air about 4 times between Bangkok and Europe during the past 7 years. In two out of four trips EVA Air have cost us extra money due to their fault and we have not received compensation. We will not be flying with EVA again except to get back home because we have already paid for the flight. On one trip from Bangkok to Amsterdam they cancelled the return flight and told us we would have to fly from London instead. We had to throw away our connecting flight ticket from Bristol to Amsterdam and buy a train ticket from Bristol to London airport. Then we had to stay overnight in Bangkok when we arrived because we would not be able to get the last ferry to the island we lived on. Extra cost to us. We got a $100 discount voucher on our next EVA Air flight valid for 12 months. We did not have the chance to fly EVA Air in the next 12 months so the voucher expired and we ended up out of pocket by about £120 not to mention the hassle and inconvenience. Then last month our flight to Amsterdam was delayed by 2 hours out of Bangkok so we missed our connection from Amsterdam to Bristol the last flight of the day. That meant having to buy new flight tickets to the UK staying overnight in Amsterdam and petrol costs and time for our daughter to drive 2½ hours from Bristol to London return. Not to mention the hassle frustration and inconvenience to us and our family and the disappointment for our granddaughter who had to wait another day to see us. The thing is EVA Air is actually a great airline. They fly the route and times that suit us at reasonable prices have an excellent premium economy product comfortable flights good food and great entertainment. But they just do not have that human touch. As I said we will not be flying EVA Air again. A 50% error ratio is just too high. We are sure there are other airlines who actually value their customers and treat them with better care than what we have experienced with EVA Air.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,4,no
EVA Air customer review,10,J Eric,30th June 2014,"Flew SFO-TPE a few weeks ago. What a wonderful experience. Our kids' child meals came out first well decorated and delivered with a smile. They also got an EVA trinket each. The adult meals and choices were great (the ""fish floss"" was a very nice add-on to the congee). The 1 am flight was sent out on time and with many smiles from the EVA staff. The seats in the 777 were comfortable and spacious (regular economy class).

EVA Air customer review,10,T Wallace,25th June 2014,"I loved EVA's Elite Class. We are US citizens living in Singapore and make the trip back to the USA (either Seattle or LA) often. This 20+ hour one-way haul is torture in economy class and I refuse to do it again on any airline. We are United Premier 1K members and it is becoming almost impossible to find upgrade Business First seats on this route using miles and United demands $600 fee in addition to the miles with no guarantee that I would even get the upgrade. So after finding no upgrade seats available on United I gave EVA's Elite Class a try - best decision ever. The seats are soft wide and have very generous leg room. The seats are recliner style with leg rests and a ""cradle"" design. I have never been able to sleep for a minute in economy class (any airline) I was able to sleep for 8 of the 11 hours during the Taipei to Seattle section. I arrived in the USA refreshed and without jet lag. The approximate cost for the round trip upgrade to Elite class was $500 US. Well worth it. The EVA route from Singapore to USA is through Taipei Taiwan which is a better more direct route than United and the departure times are better too. EVA service was excellent the flight attendants were very helpful and friendly. In my case I was traveling with my child's prescription medicine which requires constant refrigeration. With one phone call to EVA reservations they arranged to transport my daughters medicine in the chiller. The flight attendants were already aware of my child's needs and were prepared to help us upon boarding. Amazing service! Elite Class is not simply a better economy class I consider it closer to Business Class. Maybe call it Business ""lite"". Much much better than economy class but not quite as good as Business Class. Either way it is an excellent value and I will do it again!",,,Premium Economy,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,5,yes
EVA Air customer review,,Jean Baliola-Hale,25th June 2014,Manila-Taipei-Seattle. All flights were delayed. We had a 9 hrs lay over in Taipei but they took us for a half a day city tour. Got back to the airport and still had to wait because the flight was delayed again. They didn't even offer us something to drink or a snack. We were all tired and hungry. The crews were not nice and I didn't understand them. Food was not the greatest. We had a connecting flight in Seattle and we just barely made it. We made it to Boise but our luggage didn't. So we had to spend the night in a hotel to pick up our luggage the next day. I will not fly on EVA Air again or recommend them to anyone.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,2,no
EVA Air customer review,10,Brodie Bruce,20th June 2014,Recently flew Paris CDG to Taipei in Royal Laurel Class. Excellent experience from start to finish. EVA use the new Star Alliance Lounge at CDG which is a vast improvement over previous lounges I have visited at this airport. As I was travelling alone I found the single row herring-bone seating by the windows excellent for privacy and the flat bed was very comfortable and afforded a good sleep (I am 186 cm tall). There is plenty of storage and the service could not be faulted. Food and beverage were also excellent with Dom Perignon champagne flowing. I would not hesitate to fly EVA again particularly because of the highly competitive price.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
EVA Air customer review,3,T Rebong,8th June 2014,Seattle Tacoma International Airport to Taipei in Economy. Boarding is a mess the staff were terrible on when to call your zone. Most of the time you're flight will be delayed just because boarding took too long. The seat is fair for economy when you recline the bottom part of the seat it slides forward so you somewhat lay down. However there isn't a footrest. The width and recline is reasonable. I sat in the upper deck and I like that there is a compartment on the side therefore you have more legroom. You also get a very tiny pillow and surprisingly a nice blanket. The inflight meal is what you would expect for economy. You will have two choices. Flight attendants were the worst I have encountered. The inflight entertainment is awful the screen is smaller than an iPad mini and you have very limited choices of movies. Overall I wouldn't fly with EVA again.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,,2,no
EVA Air customer review,10,Forty Edward,4th June 2014,London-Bangkok-London. This is our second time with EVA Airway and they are a brilliant airline. The Elite Class cabin is extremely spacious and you feel relaxed at all times and that is what you want for the start of your holiday. The staff were so friendly and efficient throughout the flight bringing drinks and snacks constantly and if you need anything they are quick to respond. There were 6 of us in our party and two were new to EVA Airways and this is why we chose them to make sure that their flight was a comfortable one due to our previous experience. I have read some previous reviews about people having problems with foot space due to the entertainment boxes under the seats being in the way but I think that this is a ridiculous comment as there is plenty of space to stretch your feet. We have travelled extensively and also myself with work and we have been extremely impressed with EVA Airways and would definitely recommend them.,,,Premium Economy,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,5,yes

EVA Air customer review,3,C Thompson,5th May 2014,LHR-BKK Premium Economy - I have flown this journey a number of times. I found the experience very hit and miss some of the premium economy cabin staff are okay most are just rude. Food is bearable although if you want to know what is in the meal good luck most staff have only basic English. When travelling Premium with EVA you need to remember the 10 hours between meals are stewardesses personal time. You may get half a glass of warm water or warm apple juice. The IFE is generally acceptable. Flight announcements are annoyingly loud when it comes through on your earphones.,,,Premium Economy,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,,1,no
EVA Air customer review,8,D Ford,5th May 2014,BKK-LHR. Written from the perspective of someone who for the last few years has only used EVA Business Class. Very fast check in at Bangkok the EVA lounge at Bangkok is well furnished and with an ample supply of food and drink. The flight itself was 10 minutes late departing but the time was made up during the flight and we arrived 15 minutes ahead of schedule. The meals were satisfactory and well presented with never ending refills of tea or coffee a range of soft drinks were available throughout the flight. There was also a mid flight snack of rolls and sandwiches served during the flight and water and juice were offered every hour or at the touch of a button from the cabin attendants. The cabin crew were excellent with a good level of English and as I have always found with EVA pleasant and convivial. During the flight a passenger required the assistance of a doctor and the cabin crew dealt with the emergency in a very professional and calm manner. The seat legroom was good (I am over 6 ft tall) my only problem with the seats is that they do not recline enough for me to be fully comfortable but that is probably my Business Class travel being my expectation. I didn't use the IFE as I use my IPad but there was a good selection of movies and my travel companions' IFE were in use throughout the flight with no complaints. The toilets were kept spotless during the flight with a good supply if toiletries. It would be nice if Heathrow used two air bridges for unloading as the time taken to offload 300+ passengers at the furthest gate from Immigration plus the long walk from Gate 35 after a 12 hour flight is unwelcome but that just like the meltdown of the Immigration system at Heathrow is not under EVA's control.,,,Premium Economy,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,0.0,,5,yes

EVA Air customer review,8,John Peters,23rd April 2014,San Francisco to Taipei. After a couple hours spent in the EVA lounge in SFO my expectations were rather low. The lounge was small located down a long narrow corridor and offered a very modest selection of food. Once on board the flight though everything changed. The flight attendants guided the guests to their seats and were very attentive throughout the flight. I didn't want to eat the entire evening meal (the flight only leaves after midnight) and that was no problem. The food was excellent with a good selection of wines. In-flight entertainment was certainly adequate. The somewhat angled seats had lots of storage areas and once the seat was brought to the flat position I could stretch my long body out fully. The only reason I didn't give them the highest mark was due to the mediocre lounge.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5,yes

No complaints about the food or drinks that were served and the mid-flight offer of hot chocolate and cookies always seems a welcome indulgence.

EVA Air customer review,10,Ron Kuhlmann,19th April 2014,"SFO-TPE and return. Excellent service and attention from the crew. Both flight left near midnight and while the food was good on both the hour was a bit past the ideal time for dinner. Though with long hours ahead one is able to eat and still get a full night's sleep. In business the cubbies have lots of storage for ""stuff"" and that is a welcome opportunity. I noted that the crew kept the lavs clean fro the entire flight-nice touch.",,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes

EVA Air customer review,10,Peter Laight,10th April 2014,I just completed my 10th YVR-SGN round trip on EVA in deluxe economy with the occasional business class upgrade. A very reliable airline - never a delayed flight or a lost bag in all that time.

EVA Air customer review,10,G Graham,30th March 2014,We flew Vancouver Canada (YVR) to Taipei Taiwan (TPE). This segment was in business class (Premium Laurel Class) on the 747-400. We had seats 7H and 7K. Boarding was fast and efficient. The seats were in the lower forward section of the 747 and were lie-flat angled seats. The service and food was very good. We pre-ordered our meals on-line. The IFE had a good selection of choices. This was my first experience with the angled seats and it was comfortable but I would opt for the 180 degree lie flat when given the choice. The flight arrived on time and our connection in Taipei was smooth we were greeted by name and shown where to go for our next flight. Our flight to Hong Kong (HKG) was on an MD-90 in seats 2A and 2C - Business Class. Service and meals were very good as well! Our return was slightly different flying from Bangkok Thailand (BKK) to TPE on an Airbus A330. Our seats (24F and 24G) were in economy on this flight and the service and seats were very good. My only complaint was that our seats were changed within 24 hours of our trip moving us away from friends we were seated next to. This also occurred on our next flight in business class but one person offered to switch seats once we were on the plane. Our flight from TPE to Los Angeles (LAX) was on the 777-300 ER in Royal Laurel Class - their newer designed business class seats - lie flat. We were in seats 5D and 5G aisle seats. The boarding process was swift. Once again we pre- ordered our food on-line. The service was excellent throughout the flight. The food was probably the best I have had on a plane! I slept well too! It really felt like this could have been first class. I would fly Eva Air again if I have the opportunity to do so.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,10,K Chen,27th March 2014,"LAX-TPE a direct flight on the special Hello Kitty jet. From check-in to landing the service and attention I received was excellent. The check-in staff were very welcoming and when I asked for extra luggage tags and stickers (because they are so cute and definitely something to collect!) she didn't hesitate and gave me a whole stack. The crew were extremely friendly and helpful and made me feel respected and very welcome from the moment I got onboard. They came around with drinks often and they seemed to pay close attention to whether you are asleep or not because it seemed like whenever I got up I was offered drinks snacks and/or food. The toilets were very clean and carried a variety of Hello Kitty amenities and I noticed crew went in to clean up every time someone used it (I was seated close to the washroom). When I asked for some playing cards as a souvenir and one of the crew returned with a smile and several for me to take away. The seat itself is a full lie flat with a large flatscreen TV and lots of movies and tv series to choose from and came with noise-cancelling earphones. What was special was the amenity kit which was a green Rimowa case-and I believe EVA Air is the only one to give these out in Business class. The pillow was very comfortable and had a Hello Kitty motif. The duvet was so light and made from down and under them I had the best sleep I have ever had on board a flight (and I'm a light sleeper!). The only complaint I had was that the seat felt a bit narrow when going inside otherwise when you sit down or lie down there is plenty of space for your personal belongings and to stretch out. I had pre-ordered meals online and was rewarded with wonderful Taiwanese delicacies that smelt and tasted of ""home cooking"". Because it was a Hello Kitty flight the napkins were specially designed and even fruits and desserts had Hello Kitty motifs. The only down-side was that the portions were a bit small but they did not hesitate to give me more food when I asked for it. The bubbly wine onboard Dom Perignon was recently voted best in Business Class. I normally don't drink on a flight but this is definitely not something to pass up. All in all a wonderful flight experience and I would highly recommend it to business class passengers for flying long haul across the Pacific (or even for other long haul flights).",,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5,yes
EVA Air customer review,9,K Chen,27th March 2014,TPE-NRT onboard BR2189 a special Hello Kitty Airbus333 jet. Though it was a short regional flight (3.5hrs) the Business class service was excellent. The staff were very pleasant and welcoming but most wonderful of the experience was the food on board. Flights originating from TPE carry special food prepared in collaboration with Taiwan's Din Tai Fung restaurant-something you must pre-order online before the flight. The chicken soup and steam dumplings (siaolungbao) were exquisite and memorable even though they were heated on board again. The sparkling wine a sparkling rose served was light and fruity and went well with the food. Though this is not a lie-flat seat but instead a reclining one inside a pod I was surprised how comfortable it was and how long it could stretch (I am pretty tall). So I even managed to take a nice rest on the shortish flight. Highly recommend it and definitely good value for money.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,10,Buecheler Roland,26th March 2014,Travelled on Feb 22 BR88 Paris to TPE on Laurel Business herringbone 1-2-1 seating on new B777-300 with onward connection to KUL on rather old A330-200 with 2-2-2 seating. On both legs crews were very friendly and helpful. Toilets were cleaned after each use. We selected from the pre-order menu. Good selection of wines with tasty food. Both flights left on time and arrived early. Return on same routing and same type of aircraft. Again polite crew with good service. Used IFE only for music so cannot judge the quality further. Modern EVA lounge in TPE with good selection of food and drinks. Would fly them again.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5,yes
EVA Air customer review,5,S Scales,24th March 2014,We flew to BKK on 4th March in economy. The seat pitch is good the food was probably the worst I've had and myself and my boyfriend have travelled extensively and don't expect much from airline food! The cabin temp was freezing I have never been so cold and noticed many other pax in coats and jackets the staff were ok but no interaction and everything performed in military style. My parents were in premium economy and had a better experience but again not anything to rave about. I would rather pay more to travel as there are a lot better airlines out there.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,,3,no

I booked my ticket at their office in KL and pre-selected my seats and meal. I changed my seat online checked in online to avoid long queue in the airport. My food was VGML and it was fine. There were pre-meal snacks and drinks coffee or tea drink as you liked. As for the seats I am not that tall so leg room was good enough for me. Staff helped me put my hand luggage in the overhead compartment. The seats are not meant for sleeping. Staff were very friendly with a good attitude polite and good service.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,8,Mark LaPrairie,6th March 2014,BR68 LHR-BKK seat 3A Royal Laurel Class. Was first seated in 8K but found the constant opening and closing of the galley curtain annoying so moved. Overall EVA on the 777-300 has an excellent business class product. Good 1-2-1 seating good food obliging cabin crew and good IFE. Bags delivered quickly with priority bags off first. Bathrooms always spotless. Crew respond immediately to the call button. Bravo for EVA. I would definitely not hesitate to fly with them again. I used UA points for this travel and was glad I wasn't on UA with their ridiculous 2-4-2 layout in business class on their 777s and snarling crew - shameful.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,2,J Hall,5th March 2014,Flight from London to Bangkok was OK (just) but the flight back was an awful experience. We were in the middle of 4 seats and both middle seats have a metal box on the seat in front just where one leg needs to go so you end up with one leg at an angle all the time and one foot twisted. Not at all comfortable on a long flight. Seats were hard. On the way out they gave us a menu which listed cocktails liqueurs etc but we were not offered anything other than wine and only 1 glass at that. Food was not very good. Flight back to London from Bangkok was terrible. We had the same middle seats so same problem with where to put your feet. The staff were extremely unfriendly - not one smile from any of them until the point at which we all left the plane. When we asked for a gin and tonic we were treated to glares and when we (plus a number of other passengers) asked for a second glass of wine with the meal it was almost thrown at us. Inflight entertainment was not very good - very limited choice of films. I would not travel with EVA Air again.,,,Premium Economy,,,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,,2,no
EVA Air customer review,7,W Murray,28th February 2014,Flew London LHR-BKK-LHR in premium economy. Outbound flight ok and on time. Return flight which departs early afternoon somewhat spoiled by cabin crew insisting window blinds were closed despite magnificent views of the Himalayas and Russian steppe! Service was average with the tiniest glasses of wine served just once followed by several equally tiny water or juice cups. The food was OK. The return flight was set just too cold. The seat and entertainment system were both excellent. The cabin crew would be saved time and energy if they handed out personal bottles of water or juice and the one third size wine bottles we've had on trains for many years.,,,Premium Economy,,,5.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,,3,yes
EVA Air customer review,3,W MacCormac,27th February 2014,Flew between BKK-LHR economy. I've flown with them many times over the last 2 years but this may be my last time due to the below constant problem. Its the same for every flight good modern comfortable plane always on time or close to food is not great. Inflight is average. Space is not too bad better than most. My big complaint is that more often than not EVA flights are very cold! On this return flight to Heathrow on Tuesday many passengers were again shivering and wrapping up in jumpers and jackets! The stewardesses really did nothing about it even when passengers complained! You are going to lose many European customers.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,,4,no
EVA Air customer review,10,Mark LaPrairie,26th February 2014,BR67 BKK-LHR Royal Laurel Class seat 2A. Overall an excellent product. To start with a convenient early afternoon departure time from BKK with a decent early evening arrival in LHR. The flight follows the setting sun most of the way so it is a pleasant daytime flight with it just getting dark toward the end. When another passenger asked a crew member for me to close my window blind she informed him that it is a daytime flight and that I can keep my window open if I wished. I appreciated that - I get window seats so that I can look out the window and people are given eyeshades for a reason. Good 1-2-1 seat configuration and calming mood lighting including little stars on the ceiling. Efficient obliging crew. Good food. I never once went into a lavatory that was anything other than spotlessly clean. I used United Mileage Plus points for this ticket. UA could take a page out of EVA's playbook. A great longhaul experience.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,10,Michael Carter,20th February 2014,"NRT-TPE-HKG in Business class. Both these flight were ""Hello Kitty"" flights. The flight from NRT to TPE had a last minute substitution to a 777 instead of A330 which meant business class was now Royal Laurel as opposed to the standard Premium Laurel. As a result I got to try out the herringbone life flat pods which are an excellent product. TPE-HKG (which is the shorter of the 2 flights) was the regular Premium Laurel. For Business class you can pre-order your meals in advance on the EVA website and both meals were of a high standard. Cabin service also was professional polite as is typical on most Asian airlines in a premium cabin. The Hello Kitty service (and on the 2nd flight the dedicated Hello Kitty plane) is a great marketing idea and makes the flight a little different and more fun. The cabin staff seem to have fun with the concept as well.",,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5,yes
EVA Air customer review,10,Penelope Rae,17th February 2014,I flew in January 2014 to Bangkok from London. It was a faultless flight efficient professional and courteous. Whilst in Thailand I was recalled back to the UK for personal medical reasons. I emailed the Bangkok office together with my medical certificate. Within 24 hours they issued a new ticket for the day I had requested. There was simply a £25 admin fee to pay at the airport. When I arrived at the airport I was checked in through business check in and given a seat with extra leg room at the very front of economy. Their attitude helped enormously to reduce a very stressful situation.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes

Service was good food was nice not much choice regarding movie choice but ok. Unlimited amount of soft drink supplies and snacks if you go to the kitchen during the flight. Return leg was in Elite Class in Seat 23 F service generally the same as in Economy but the foot space was rather awkward due to the electrical box under the seat in front and the cabin was very warm which spoilt the return leg for me.

On the way out I was unwell and cabin staff found us a place in business class where I could lie down for most of the trip. They were very helpful and looked after me.

EVA Air customer review,8,I Hunt,20th January 2014,Royal Laurel Class AMS-BKK Jan 5th. First time with Eva and overall very impressed. Check in was fast and hassle free although lounge at Amsterdam very basic with no hot food and a 17 Euro charge for a shower but once boarded impressed with cabin crew and service. Greeted by name champagne to start and asked when I would like my pre-ordered meal. Read many comments regarding the food but beef tenderloin was delicious and was followed by a terrific dessert platter and port. Seat was best that i had encountered during the last few years plenty of storage roomier than Swiss and Thai a380 probably on a par with ANA suite. Slept on the flat bed for a good 5 hours seat not so good in recline position as feet and lower legs tend to dangle over the end. Decent breakfast. IFE not on a par with Emirates but adequate screen was large and a good selection of movies. Would use again and highly recommended.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,5,yes
EVA Air customer review,8,E Collins,17th January 2014,Flew Royal Laurel Business Class Bangkok to London LHR. First time on EVA and very impressed overall with the business class product. Comfortable single seat (a real bonus) with plenty of legroom. I had pre-ordered my meals and knew exactly what I was getting so no problems there. The service was very good but I would comment that the crew did not once come round with drinks inflight other than during the meal services. You are given a bottle of water at the start and I suppose that anything else is on request. Most airlines offer a regular supply of water and juices on a long flight. Having said that if you do ask for a beverage it is no problem. One other minor issue the main meal service (consisting of 5 courses) was served way too fast The crew were either being too efficient or couldn't wait to wrap up the meal service so they could have a good old chinwag in the galley perhaps that's why they never came round with any drinks either! Apart from that the service generally was good and as you would expect and I would certainly consider flying EVA in Business class again.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,6,D Johnson,17th January 2014,I wasn't sure about this airline when booking they far exceeded my expectations in just about every category. The Have flown premium economy for the last 15 years and it has gradually gone downhill. The old airplanes were much more comfortable in premium economy but the prices difference has continued to rise. Very simply all I want on a long flight is a leisurely meal and lots of wine and then I go to sleep. Although the crew have 11 hours dinner is literally thrown at you no pre dinner drink this is served with the food - a miserable little glass of wine and refills were non existent food pretty poor in general. Other airlines do it so much better recently flew Thai economy and it was great.,,,Premium Economy,,,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,,3,no
EVA Air customer review,10,A Acosta,10th January 2014,I wasn't sure about this airline when booking they far exceeded my expectations in just about every category. The one area that needs immediate improvement is the quality of the food or maybe our western taste buds are overmatched by the eastern style menu. In my opinion the food quality was horrible. But in every other category this airline is well above standard. It begins with the crew who hustles at every opportunity and provides an excellent customer service experience. The cleanliness of the aircraft was noticeable the bathrooms were kept clean and the staff were genuinely friendly. I'd rate these guys as 5 star easily 5 star. Two last notes due to the length of their flights I would recommend adding additional video content. And for some reason on our last leg (TPE-LAX) the a/c was set at an especially cold setting with most passengers resorting to their coats during flight All other legs (LAX-TPE TPE-BKK and BKK-TPE) were fine.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,,5,yes
EVA Air customer review,7,D Tudor,6th January 2014,"I flew out of LHR using premium economy and the return was economy. The premium economy is well worth the extra money although if I did the same configuration again I'd do economy on way to BKK and Premium Economy on way back as flight back always seems to take so much longer and the economy seats whilst not terrible are cramped if you sit next to someone large. Food in my opinion is awful in economy with Premium Economy no better although I think they serve ice-cream. Alcohol must have a very definitive service policy because I can manage two glasses of red wine in Premium Economy and one small glass in economy. asking for more is met with a ""certainly sir"" but then they immediately forget. This happens every time so it must be policy. I'd prefer them to tell me ""no"" rather than making me wait for nothing. Check-in staff at Bangkok were excellent. I have two small kids and they bent over backwards to help us get them through passport control quickly and easily and we boarded the plane first. I am very impressed with this aspect. Shame London can't come close to offering a similar service. All-in-all EVA is very good but prices are creeping up so I might be shopping around. Also the day-time return flight is not good for young kids who are wide awake and fidgeting all the time. An evening flight that they can sleep through is a better option.",,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,,3,yes

EVA Air customer review,10,D Ford,19th December 2013,LHR-BKK. This was my first London - Bangkok flight since the new Royal Laurel Class was introduced on this route in August. The new herringbone seat layout is ideal for the solo traveller although I am not so sure it is ideal for families as the centre aisle seats are angled to face away from each other. However I was travelling alone so a window seat was great as the seat is fitted out like your own personal shell. At 180cm tall I had no problem in stretching out on the lay flat beds and the comfort able duvet and pillow enabled a few hours of sleep. As always the cabin crew were excellent and attentive without being intrusive. The flight left 5 minutes early and arrived in Bangkok 20 minutes ahead of schedule. Baggage handling at both ends was simple and efficient. All in all EVA have a great product at a competitive price.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,0.0,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,6,Sean Kuo,5th December 2013,Non-stop flight in November from Taipei (TPE) to Paris (CDG) on the Royal Laurel Class. The new lounge at Taipei is renovated with somewhat night club decor and mood lighting. Its spacious not over crowded and with a lot of food and beverage selections. However there was long wait for the showers so be aware to allow at least one hour before departure if you wish to take a shower. The new Royal Laurel class is indeed one of the best business class hard products in the industry. The seat is spacious and extremely comfortable. Each seat has direct aisle access and a lot of storage. The pillow and comforter are in good quality. EVA also serves Dom Perignon as pre departure drink which is indeed a plus on already quite impressive hard product. The service was a little disappointing. The crews seemed to be exhausted and just wanted to get things done as soon as possible so in general it lacked the personal touch and interaction with passengers. To be fair my glass was never empty and crews did come by promptly when I hit the call button. The food was adequate but not fantastic and portions were skimpy. A couple of small things I felt somehow to shadow the whole relatively positive experience. One is the crews retrieved the menus while passengers falling asleep. I felt it was sneaky and to be green in the wrong way. In short good hard product and adequate food and service. I will be happy to fly EVAs Royal Laurel Class again.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,,4,yes

Without any doubt the best business class you can fly from AMS to BKK! Staff were extremely friendly and the food very good.

Not all available seats show and on the return trip was advised at baggage drop that the cabin was full. Managed to swap pre-booked seat for aisle seat at front of cabin. The cabin was in fact less than 50% full. No one next to me and it appeared people travelling on their own had empty seats next to them. Staff very pleasant.

EVA Air customer review,10,L Nicholson,10th November 2013,"Just completed my 7th round trip from California to Asia on EVA Air. Prices are good for class of service the schedules keep flight times minimized and most flights are zero or one stops. Airport staff friendly and helpful willing to accommodate last minute changes such as seat change or even flight change if running late. I have flown mostly Elite Class but also Economy and Business and flight attendants are pleasant smiling and wanting to make sure you have what you need. In the 14+ hour flight across the Pacific they serve two meals but often come around with something to drink or snack on. Until recently EVA was the only airline to offer the Elite Class with 38"" seat spacing and extra width over economy all for a reasonable cost increase over Economy. Much better than the United Airlines joke of Economy Plus which is maybe 35"" and still skinny so you have to try to sleep with your arms tight to your sides! I loved the Business Class lay-flat bed - I slept and had no problem coming home to the 16 hour time change no jet lag. The only thing negative is the Business Class screen while a nice 15"" it seemed dim and the resolution of shows was obviously not HD. But I am not complaining (I think I can live without my technology for 12 hours!).",,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,9,John Stroobant,4th November 2013,I flew Business class return LHR to BKK this was my first experience with this airline and I was very impressed. Although 30 minutes late leaving LHR it was on time on the return. The Business class seating is excellent with plenty of private space completely flat beds and a warm duvet. The service was perfect on both journeys: helpful courteous and charming even at the end of 2 long flights. Although the food is not very adventurous it was good quality and there were western Thai and Chinese choices. A good drinks service which did not seem to be limited. The latest movies and other entertainment are on an excellent screen. I would highly recommend this airline and will try the economy service on another occasion.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,5,yes
EVA Air customer review,8,G C Nock,29th October 2013,LHR-BKK return in Royal Laurel recently. The fully flat seats are a vast improvement over the previous seats the inflight entertainment is reasonable. The quality of available drinks was good with Dom Perignon Champagne served and decent quality wines we pre-ordered our meals and they were satisfactory. Managed to get aprox 7 hours sleep outbound my only concern is that whilst the seating is comfortable in my opinion the pod style design does not allow much ventilation and therefore I got quite hot.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,9,A Willis,28th October 2013,HK-Toronto via Taipei - Economy. It was my second time taking this route and I am just as impressed as the first time around at how well this airline is run. The seats are great for economy the food is excellent cabin crew are top-notch and most important this airline is by far the most 'on time' airline I've even flown with. We were about 15 minutes late out of the gate in Taipei but the pilots made up for it by getting us to Toronto an hour and a half early. With the consistent quality excellent pricing and value I am still not sure why this airline is still only four star. I normally take the same route with Cathay at almost double the price for a typically terrible customer experience. The Asia - N. America carrier scene is getting shook up by EVA and there should be more attention paid to it. Well done!,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5,yes
EVA Air customer review,8,David Read,20th October 2013,I like to fly elite class whenever I go to BKK from London as it's a long flight and the extra legroom and bigger seat is well worth the extra money. My only gripe is the small snack on the return to London which takes forever and seems even longer as it's a mid day take off could do with a bit more than a small meat roll in what must've been ten hours between meals.,,,Premium Economy,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,10,P West,16th October 2013,Business class from JFK to Osaka Japan via Taipei. The trip was as good as it can get for a 15-20 hour flying time. Superb staff and service. Comfortable seating with the large TV and lie flat seats. (I'm 6ft 3). Managed 7 hours of sleep. Would definitely use again.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,10,C Braybrooke,1st October 2013,Travelled business class Osaka to Taipei on an A330. Excellent service with comfortable and spacious cabin. Staff were attentive and food was plentiful and well presented. Seat was comfortable although TV screen was small. This airline is as good as other major Asian airlines and Taipei was easy to transit through.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5,yes
EVA Air customer review,9,Neil Osrin,18th September 2013,My second trip with EVA this year direct from BKK-LHR on 777ER and pleased they have joined star alliance network. I bought a promo fare from travel agent and checked in online easily. At the airport the check-in opened on time and the staff helpful and changed my seat without any fuss. The boarding was swift plane clean and seats comfortable with good legroom. There were firm pillows and fluffy blankets but no amenity kits. After take off nice snacks and drinks were served (with no ice). Lunch was a choice of pork steak or chicken. I tried both and chicken was better. It was served with a container of fresh fruit small cake and small mixed salad and dressing and warm bread roll and butter. The food was adequate but not that interesting and the mash with the pork steak was particularly bad. After lunch an assortment of low quality crackers/cookies were put in the galley. Later chicken rolls were served and then at the end of the flight another hot meal and I thought the fried rice was tasty. The PTV had a good movie selection and sound. The service was great and I found all the crew to be polite and humble and efficient and they maintained the bathrooms very well. Besides the food quality being a little 'cheap' I really could not fault this economy flight or this airline at all - they are now my carrier of choice.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,3,yes
EVA Air customer review,7,A Bor,17th September 2013,Paris-CDG to Taipei Taoyuan airport. My global impression of this flight is good. Cabin crew friendly and very professional. Service was efficient. Inflight entertainment quite good. However there were some bad points. The meal was very poor (just the main course with appetizer and desert but no salt no pepper and other things like in other airlines) and incredibly tasteless. Plus our flight had suffered from 2 hours of delay due to airplane problem. The problem was not the delay (it may happen sometimes) as we were provided food and water but the airport staff had apparently forgotten to tell me about the delay so I discovered it a little bit late! Yet the delay had been scheduled hours before departure. However my impression is that EVA Air is a good airline with a good cabin crew.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,,3,yes
EVA Air customer review,10,Charles Kennedy,5th September 2013,LHR-BKK. Wanted to try this service for ages but it was too many FF points to leave on the table however now they are in Star Alliance. Check in was a breeze skipped the lounge in favour of playing the piano that faces gate 23. Boarding was orderly and was shown to my window seat in the last row of Royal Laurel business class. Seat is spacious and appealing angled towards the windows. Pushed on time and took off to the west. Only complaint about the catering is that it did not include any Asian options. I had a nice steak for dinner and scrambled egg and bacon for breakfast but would have loved some nice Chinese food for dinner and pork and noodles in the morning. Crew could not have been more attentive coming by during meals and drinks every couple of minutes specifically to check if anything was needed / needed to be collected. Seat reclines full flat got some hours sleep under a very thick and comfortable duvet. Landed on time and after a very long walk immigration took only a few minutes. Priority tagged bag was one of the first on the carousel. Flawless performance from EVA my first time but not my last.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,,5,yes
EVA Air customer review,10,W Bee,5th September 2013,Usually I fly Elite (Economy plus) but I received an upgrade to Business Class at LAX probably due to Diamond status. Great experience: lay-flat seats with lots of space very functional mini cabin with privacy the multi- course meal was accompanied by excellent wines. No complaints. The IFE could have a bit better selection but given that one can really sleep in those seats it is not possible to watch more than two or three movies. Restrooms were kept very clean and cabin service was First Class! Much better than on any US or European airline. Baggage came within a few minutes after reaching the belt. Overall a memorable experience.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5,yes
EVA Air customer review,10,T Alvin,4th September 2013,"BR 857 TPE-HKG. The Hello Kitty flight was fine. Adjustable headrests decent recline. The seats had a Hello Kitty headrest and the toilet was Hello Kitty themed. Inflight entertainment was excellent somehow unequipped with my favourite type of movie (family comedy). Downsides was not so enthusiastic service and the fact that the jet was called ""Happy Music"". What kind of name is that?",,,Economy Class,,,5.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,7,P Enz,1st September 2013,TPE-LAX and SFO-TPE: Staff members at check-in transfer desk lounge and in cabin were all very polite and helpful. Seat was comfortable with enough leg room and space (9-abreast instead of 10 in B777). All meals were excellent. Personal IFE is also good although the library is a bit small for long flights.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,7,M Liepmann,27th August 2013,Recently traveled BKK-LHR-BKK in Premium Economy. The reason we chose the airline was price and being a new member on Star Alliance. Overall the flights were okay nothing too bad but also nothing to be very excited about. BKK- LHR we sat in 20A/C - first row of Premium Economy. The seats are comfortable and recline very generous. In the Bulkhead rows monitors are in the armrests of the seats making them a little less wide than the normal premium seats. Legroom was also slightly restricted due to the dividing wall with business class. I could not stretch my legs completely. Food was is best described as okay. I have to agree with other reviewers and say that drinks services were very poor on this 12 hour flight. 2 rounds of drinks during the meal followed by two water runs until the snack before landing was served. In Premium economy passengers get a half litre bottle of water after take off which in theory can be refilled by crew. I walked to the galley in economy mid flight and was told that they had run out of water. I did get a refill from the business class galley. On the way back to BKK we sat in 22A and C which was much more comfortable than the bulkhead seats. Food and drink services on this flight were much better. Cabin crew was also genuinely more friendly than on the outbound flight. Overall we were okay with the product particularly given the good rates we had for our trip. We will use them again if rates are favourable.,,,Premium Economy,,,4.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,7,Kevin Wong,18th August 2013,Flew return from New York JFK to TPE. Check in was pretty smooth. Food service was given twice with a snack in between which was decent for me. The food tasted pretty decent. The seats were a little too thin so it made it hard to sleep only got 4 hours of sleep total which wasn't enough for a 15 hour flight. The cabin crew were very nice and kind. The IFE system was decent enough. We departed on time and arrived 25 minutes early. However things went pretty bad on the way back to NYC. First of all the plane that I rode on arrived late from its previous flight. The ground crew were not ready for 40 minutes after our boarding time. Then when we got onto the plane and just before the plane left the gate the IFE system broke down. In the end it took them more than 1 hour just to replace the entire system altogether. A lot of passengers seemed upset for a very late departure time which was around 9pm. We arrived in NY more than 1 hour late. Though the IFE system was replaced I couldn't watch any movies or TV shows which was pretty sad. But other than that everything went well. Hopefully this will be the first and last problem that I will have with EVA Air.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,3,yes
EVA Air customer review,5,J Yeh,22nd July 2013,Used my miles to upgrade from Economy to Elite Class. Not much of a big difference seat wise was a bigger seat but wasn't able to fall asleep comfortably. Water is given at the beginning of the flight. Food tasted better than Economy and also included a menu to choose. Liked the fact that haagen dazs ice cream was offered after one of the meals. The table is stored in the arm rest which is better than the table in Economy because it offered more space. Overall Elite class was better because of the food and the table. Also more movies are included throughout the flight.,,,Premium Economy,,,3.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,,2,yes
EVA Air customer review,9,Gary Green,10th July 2013,BNE-CDG and return. Great service on both legs staff were efficient and friendly.

Service from cabin crew was fantastic very polite helpful and thorough. Seats were spacious and comfortable. The food service during the flight was excellent. Overall a very professional affordable airline that I will certainly be using again.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,5,yes
EVA Air customer review,9,Neil Osrin,30th May 2013,LHR-BKK on 777ER. Check in swift and polite boarding easy. Seat amenities included slippers a warm fluffy blanket and firm pillow. I found the seat and leg room very comfortable and managed to sleep 7 hrs. I was sleeping during the main meal services but the night time snacks and sandwiches were good. Arrived on time and the crew were professional and polite and very helpful and kept washrooms well maintained. I liked the fact that in flight announcements were kept to a minimum. I will be making EVA air my carrier of choice for the future - very impressed!,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,,3,yes

EVA Air customer review,9,Dennis Terry,23rd May 2013,"Have made 5x LHR-BKK return flights this year all in Premium Laurel. Flight service cabin food and IFE was always good with nothing to complain about though the food on the BKK-LHR section is notable superior to the LHR-BKK sector. Ticket prices give good value for money compared to other carriers on the same route. But I have one complaint - the WiFi in the EVA lounge at Bangkok airport doesn't work. It doesn't work at all! On the 5 occasions I've transited I either couldn't get my laptop to ""connect"" properly to the EVA router or if I did then the Web access was so slow as to be unusable. This isn't satisfactory state of affairs for any international airline. All business-class Pax want in an airline lounge is tea/coffee/soft drinks/snacks and reliable WiFi. The WiFi doesn't have to be 2Mbit super-fast or anything like that. Just ordinary speed and reliable. Me flying again to LHR next week but am pre-paying to get access to the nearby CIP lounge (which does have very superior speedy web access).",,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,5,yes
EVA Air customer review,6,Martin Ling,19th May 2013,"Flew economy London-Bangkok. On the positive side flight left on time and arrived 15 minutes early. The seats are decent for economy and the IFE has a reasonable choice. The disappointing thing was the poor service attitude of the crew who were mostly cold and stand-offish. The meal quality was fairly average for economy airline food but it would be nice to see a menu or be told how the food is prepared instead of just being asked ""do you want chicken or pork"". Also they are very mean with drinks i was given half a small plastic glass of wine with dinner. There was no cold drinks offered between the 2 meals the crew seemed to just disappear for long periods.",,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,,3,yes
EVA Air customer review,9,G Palmer,14th May 2013,Flew Elite (premium economy) LHR-BKK-LHR in April returning May. Done this trip a few times and always happy with Eva's Elite cabin. Comfortable seat decent food and service great IFE choices. Some slight wear-and-tear evident - In-seat USB didn't work on either journey (for charging or I assume screen use) outbound the leg rest button didn't work and it had to be manually extended.,,,Premium Economy,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,5,yes
EVA Air customer review,9,Neil Osrin,10th May 2013,First time with EVA. BKK-LHR. The BKK check-in was professional and the boarding quick and organised. Immediately after take off drinks were served from a tray with a bag of snacks. Drinks were a little warm and had no ice. Lunch was then served and trays cleared quickly. The food was poor and the selections unimaginative and pork was fatty. During the flight sandwiches and snacks were served which were tasty. The final meal was served just before landing and was not great. Seats were very comfortable and leg room generous. The blankets were small and made from quite a hard material. The crew were very pleasant efficient and professional. Toilets were well stocked and immaculately maintained throughout the flight. The PTV had good sound and screens but the movie selection could be improved. Overall very impressed with EVA and would book with them again.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,,3,yes
EVA Air customer review,8,C Hazelford,4th May 2013,"The food and service was outstanding staff delightful and polite. I think EVA's service is their strong point. Their weak point would be their seats which could double as a chiropractic device from the Middle Ages. As a 6"" tall man in the seated position the seat was perfect. However putting the seat into sleep mode brought the dreaded ""night slips"" where one has the sensation of sliding down the seat. To compensate for this rather unpleasant sensation the cradle position of the seat is much more comfortable. The toilets were spotless. Taipei to Toronto the staff were exceptional.",,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,5,yes
EVA Air customer review,8,L Ling,1st May 2013,Took a round trip from Seattle to Kuala Lumpur recently. My major complaint is with the seat - it is pretty uncomfortable especially on the 747 due to lack of cushions. The flight attendants are friendly and helpful. Overall quite happy with the service provided - would fly again on EVA if unable to find a better price on flight. Will pay slightly more for a more comfortable seat.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,10,Steve Green,16th April 2013,I have just returned from holiday in Thailand flying with EVA Air for the first time and was very impressed with them. When we first boarded the plane at Heathrow we thought how clean and tidy the plane was. We flew economy class which I was slightly concerned about due to having a 13 hour flight and being 6 ft 4 tall but were very pleased with the amount of legroom and the comfort of the seats. The cabin crew were very professional polite and helpful. The meals served were of a very high standard and the inflight entertainment was very good. Will definitely be using them again.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
EVA Air customer review,,Paul Cremin,3rd April 2013,Flew LHR-BKK-LHR in Premium Economy with 1 suitcase and 1 set of golf clubs on a golfing holiday. Left LHR and everything was fine. On my return they decided that with my golf clubs I was 10kgs over my baggage allowance and wanted to charge me $450 excess baggage. My ticket cost almost £1000 for an upgraded economy seat so I wasn't prepared to pay anymore. My clubs are still in Bangkok! EVA airline both in BKK and at the offices in London are like robots. I would rather walk to Bangkok carrying golf clubs on my back than fly with EVA again.,,,Premium Economy,,,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,,2,no
EVA Air customer review,9,Karen Lowe,1st April 2013,YVR-TPE-YVR Elite cabin (747-400). Seat was very comfortable with good recline and footrest. Good pitch. Service for YVR-TPE was excellent with good attendants and drink runs every hour virtually on the hour. TPE- YVR service was less personal with fewer drink runs but still far better than most North American airlines. AVOD responsive with good selection of movies TV shows and others. Pillow and blanket offered and slippers with amenities kit. Where they faltered was the catering food was plentiful for me but definitely on the bland side. Elite seats are worth the money for 10 hour plus long-haul. I walked to the back to check out the economy seats and they frankly looked a bit horrifying - narrow with 3-4-3 layout and seemed a bit thinly padded. Ground crew at both YVR and TPE efficient and polite. I would gladly fly EVA Air Elite again.,,,Premium Economy,,,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,10,Janet Stimpson,1st April 2013,Flew premium economy for the first time as we usually just go economy. Was very impressed. Food was very good and the inflight entertainment was also good. Have been flying EVA since 2005 I like that it is a direct flight from Heathrow to Bangkok. Cabin staff always smiling and polite. Have never had any problems. Will definitely fly premium economy again.,,,Premium Economy,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,5,yes
EVA Air customer review,3,P Woodward,1st April 2013,Return flight from LHR to BKK. Travelled in economy class and boy did we feel that we were in economy. They were on an economy drive with drinks when you asked for one you were offered water and then it was only max 100ml 5 hours into the flight and we had been offered only 2 small drinks. The food was just indescribably bad! For a 12 hour flight the seat comfort has not been taken into consideration although the leg room is adequate. Like other reviewers we found the staff to be rude and the announcements to be inaudible. All in all a very uncomfortable and unpleasant 12.5 hours.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,,1,no
EVA Air customer review,10,W Hughes,19th March 2013,London To Bangkok (Premium Economy) March 2nd returning 16th. On time going out 30 mins late on return but made up time so arrived back into London pretty much on time. Efficient and easy check-in at both ends. Airy and spacious cabin ample space and legroom though could have done with a foot rest as the calf support didn't reach as far as your feet. Staff very pleasant on both flights and food and drink excellent and plentiful (particularly on the return flight) with plenty of juice and water runs. Couldn't fault the in-flight entertainment with so many recent films also good documentaries and travel items. We were offered assistance in reaching our homeward connecting flight before disembarking and our baggage had been tagged priority so it reached out connecting flight without problem. Would recommend EVA Premium Economy and would definitely fly with them again.,,,Premium Economy,,,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
EVA Air customer review,9,K Barrance,19th March 2013,Very good flights LHR-BKK and return during March. Crew were efficient and pleasant and the comfort of the seats and the entertainment was excellent with good choice of up to the minute films and some interesting TV programmes. The only thing that lets EVA down is the food. Not sure how they dream up the meals but they really could do with some improvement.,,,Premium Economy,,,4.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,8,G Roberts,14th March 2013,Taipei-Toronto return in business. Both flights on time. Overall good experience. Newly remodelled Taipei lounge looks like a Vegas cocktail bar from the 80s. They use the KLM lounge in Toronto which has seen better days.

The only down side is the non flat beds which makes it difficult to sleep. I was told on the flight that they will be replacing all seats by August 2013 to flat beds for the LHR-BKK route. We will be using EVA air again for my trips to Bangkok.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,2,D Tobin,4th March 2013,I have flown EVA Air before and found their Premium Economy pretty good. However my most recent experience with them was poor and I found the customer service upon my return very bad. I was on a BKK-LHR flight. About 2 hours into the flight my screen and those of people around me went blank without explanation. After restarting my movie it happened 2 more times until it stopped working altogether. I asked a member of cabin crew who shrugged her shoulders and said there was nothing she could do. So for the remainder of my 12 hour flight I sat and twiddled my thumbs. The food was awful consisting of an omelette for one meal and noodles for another. Neither looked very appetising. I see from the other comments on here that many customers have commented on the poor food quality. One alcoholic drink was offered throughout the flight. The cabin announcements were inaudible which must be a health and safety issue? Finding a way to complain is difficult. I won't fly with them again if I can help it.,,,Premium Economy,,,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,2,no
EVA Air customer review,10,G Richardson,25th February 2013,My scheduled flight with KLM was cancelled due to snow in January and my connecting flight AMS-BKK was assigned to EVA Air. I was impressed how organised embankment was. Onboard our Economy Plus seats were like business class alike. I got a little toiletry bag with toothbrush moisturiser and face wash. Slippers were a nice touch to get shoes off. Leg room was excellent I could completely stretch my legs and I'm about 6 feet. Food was delicious plenty of drinks. Next time I'm flying to Far East I'm flying with Eva Air.,,,Premium Economy,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5,yes
EVA Air customer review,8,Terence J O'Neill,25th February 2013,London To Bangkok (economy) Feb 8th returning 22nd. Good staff at both ends booking in was efficient and seamless. The e-ticket is very helpful as you have no worries about loosing your boarding cards. The plane was clean and airy. The seats were soft and spacious leg room was not an issue for me (I am 6ft). The AVOD was crammed with good movies music and games. Staff well turned out helpful and they were always smiling. Drinks were available at all times with juice and water runs made regularly. My only issue was the food. I had chicken and rice on both legs and it was poor both times. The deserts were very good better then many other airlines I have flown with.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,,5,yes
EVA Air customer review,3,D B Breen,18th February 2013,Economy Class SEA-MNL. I am frequent flier with EVA and have just about come to a point where I do not want to use them anymore. The food on this trip was very poor in 2 instances I could not eat more 20% of the meal because it was such an odd taste. Seat comfort is actually pretty decent for economy class - I give EVA a better grade for that but service has really been on the decline the last couple of times I have used them. In Manila you can expect to stand in line for a minimum of 1 hour to check in. In cabin service is poor - the last 2 times flying with them I found the staff to be rude and abrasive. Not sure I will use EVA again.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,,3,no
EVA Air customer review,7,W MacCormac,8th February 2013,Flew the first time with EVA between LHR- BKK. Good points direct nice B777 very comfortable flight (much better than A346) easy night flight outbound and evening return into LHR is also good. Space in economy bearable. Stewardesses good even if smile appears fake. Bad point is food / ordering snack and drinks. Breakfast sausage look like made of cardboard and taste like cardboard. Drinks EVA are very tight! Try and order any alcohol other than the cheap wine during meal and they write it down like its a special order and you wait 10 minutes for a little plastic cup.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,,3,yes
EVA Air customer review,7,D Bokr,6th February 2013,Premium Laurel Class from AMS to BKK. B777-300. Evening departure. Before departing water or orange juice offered. Champagne only served with the dinner service. Food ex AMS very bland. Spicy seafood dish that I pre-ordered online was nothing but spicy and no sauce to go with the steamed rice. Dinner service seemed very rushed. Pre-dinner drinks not offered. A bottle of water was passed out to each customer and then the crew appeared again only in time to serve breakfast 2 hours before landing. AVOD systems was good with ample videos and audio programmes. No chance of sleeping on these seats. They are not fully lie-flat. You keep slipping down despite being given a comfort pillow which you place under your legs. It did not help. The duvet and pillow were of good quality. Toilets were kept spotless throughout the flight. On arrival into BKK our Priority baggage arrived first at baggage claim. The return flight was an afternoon flight. The crew didn't seem as rushed and were much friendlier. Again same aircraft type same seats. Catering out of BKK was just as disappointing. The salad consisted of a few large leaves and a few tomatoes. Although I love salad this just wasn't appetizing. Again the main entree very bland. Wines OK. The best plate is dessert. It consisted of 2 small cakes raspberry ice cream a cheese plate and crackers and a nice selection of fruit. Coffee was brewed individually for each guest. The onboard bar in this class was not stocked so you could not go and help yourself to refreshments or snacks as their website advertises. At both stations it was an on time departure and arrival. I can recommend EVA since they had a very competitive fare ex AMS. However they should give their catering and seat comfort issues some thought.,,,Business Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,9,D Ford,25th January 2013,London-Bangkok return. Departed early December returned mid January. Flight both ways departed early and arrived early. Cabin crew spoke excellent English and interacted well with pax. Champagne and a good selection of drinks served throughout the flight. Food well presented and an ample portion. Self serve Snacks and drinks available at bar at back of cabin during flight. Only drawback is that the seats are not true lie flat but the duvets and pillows supplied make it easy to get comfortable if you want to sleep. IFE appeared to be popular although I did not use it as I had movies on my iPad. Overall the same standard of comfort and service that I have come to expect from EVA Air. Baggage handling at both destinations very quick and Fast Track voucher give for immigration at both Bangkok and London.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,0.0,,5,yes
EVA Air customer review,5,Joe Merieux,11th January 2013,London to Bangkok. Late departing by over an hour - used the excuse of the late inward flight which was only late by 32 minutes. Explanation didn't cover the extra delay and why they schedule a departure with no room to recover any delay. Food OK - but the real disappointment is alcohol and tea and coffee - all are given out in tiny amounts. I was given about 1 inch of wine in a glass. I asked for another drink and was directly to another flight attendant - and my request was lost. Same for tea and coffee- treated like gold. I found this frustrating. In flight entertainment up to the standards of BA. Plane clean lavatories were cleaned mid- flight. Staff smile a lot.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,9,R Peter,9th January 2013,I flew from AMS to BKK return in economy plus. This class is worth the extra money. The seats have enough space in front for my legs. A good choice of recent media entertainment. The food was tasty the crew very nice. During the 'night' they kept bringing water and juices every 20 minutes. The only negative point is that there was a delay when everyone was already on board and that meant that you had to wait extra long to get your meal. Next month I fly again with EVA to BKK.,,,Premium Economy,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,5,yes
EVA Air customer review,7,D Marsh,7th January 2013,LHR to BKK 13th December - check in very busy would advise to check in online beforehand if possible. Flight attendants pleasant but nothing over and above this. Food average and not enough drink runs for 11 hour flight wine available with meals but only with short measures and had to ask for a top up in a glass larger than a shot glass. Good selection of films and good seat pitch.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,,3,yes
EVA Air customer review,9,Dennis Glover,2nd January 2013,Previously flew with EVA 1998 London-Bangkok again this time flew London-Bangkok and what tremendous improvements they have made. The cabin crew on both the outbound and return flights were excellent and carried out their duties in a very efficient polite manner. Very pleased.,,,Premium Economy,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,8,Luz Alano,20th December 2012,Impressed with its organized check in and inflight services. In Vancouver while waiting for our flight all passengers regardless of which class flight we were booked were all given access to free coffee tea and hot chocolate. In Taipei on my way to Manila I was impressed with the way the signs were placed. There's no confusion and passengers need no even ask where to go for their connecting flights. I flew premium economy from YVR to Taipei and I had a good service of meals leg room and any basic thing I needed. Economy flight from Taipei to Manila was equally good with ample leg room. I would recommend.,,,Premium Economy,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,5,yes
EVA Air customer review,8,Anderson Yu,18th December 2012,CCS to TPE. CCS-MIA-SFO with American Airlines. SFO-TPE with EVA Air. It was 1am we were very tired. Before boarding EVA for TPE when we arrived SFO the computer system showed we had no Vegetarian food booked however ground staff made it possible and we got our special meal service on board. Onboard flight attendants were friendly.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,9,G Dalgleish,12th December 2012,Flew HAK-TPE-LAX in business class on EVA. Overall very impressed with service new lie flat seats on B777 were excellent. Would highly recommend this option as a very good business class product from service to seating comfort.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,5,yes
EVA Air customer review,10,J Johns,2nd December 2012,TPE-PEK. New aircraft good in-flight entertainment. Was also upgraded to premium economy so that myself and my wife could sit together (was late choosing seats online and the flight was full so no two seats available next to each other) which was great as we were traveling with our infant. Staff were good. The flight was hassle-free and cabin service was efficient. Flying with Eva Air was an unexpected pleasure.,,,Premium Economy,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,3,yes
EVA Air customer review,6,G C Nock,23rd November 2012,LHR-BKK return. The seats are reasonable to sit in but it's a struggle to sleep due to the sloping angle. Pre booked meals on both flights both were of a good standard as was the wine served. I have issues on the return leg as they wish to get settled on Thai time hence you have to ask for an alcoholic drink and are served with a grudge they then serve you a breakfast approx 1.5 hrs prior to landing at LHR at 7 pm - I am sure most customers would prefer a dinner type offering and a drink service. Still good value but I am trying Thai on my next trip.,,,Business Class,,,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,6,R Frankel,6th November 2012,Elite Economy is worth the extra money. There is a separate check in line at the airport. Boarding is after first class passengers. Seat pitch is 40 inches. Flights from SFO to Taipei serve two meals. Notwithstanding the first meal service is just after takeoff (approximately 1.30 am) the next meal service is approximately 8-9 hours later. The aircraft is a newer airplane very quiet and spacious.,,,Premium Economy,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,0.0,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,10,Peter Lee,3rd November 2012,LAX-TPE. The check-in line was really long but after getting through the lines the process was pretty fast. The food on the plane was average. For economy class it was a little pricey. Very little in-flight entertainment. I would have definitely preferred some more leg space but otherwise the seat was fine. The crew was very nice and helpful and most of them were smiling. Other than the fact that there is little in- flight entertainment EVA Air is a great selection.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,8,Gareth Allen,1st November 2012,Excellent flight from Heathrow to Bangkok economy class. Very roomy seat nice new planes excellent entertainment system and half decent food. Last time I flew EVA was 10 years ago this is a much better experience now than it was then. Will fly them again.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,3,V Kasm,11th October 2012,Seats were more comfortable than other pricier airlines for economy. Food was okay but again better than others. Staff kept passing by our row when they came with the drink cart & it was difficult to get them to come back (but may have been a language barrier). Had to help ourselves to slippers & blankets on the flight back since staff did not pass them out but not a big deal. Inflight entertainment not as good as other airlines - wasn't much selection. They lost one of our luggage in Toronto before we even got on the flight & it took them more than 3 weeks to find it & send it to our destination (by this time we had come back). They can't send it back to us & offered us $80. Not impressed at all with their customer service in this regard.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,,3,no
EVA Air customer review,7,Gael Dufoyet,9th October 2012,CDG-TPE. Check in a breeze used Air France lounge in T1 - no decent Asian carrier should subject their passengers to such a low standard. Seat was the slanted kind of hard business class seats that get very uncomfortable after 4 hours. Could hardly get any sleep and there is nowhere to put things nor any privacy from your neighbor. The amenities were great. All their toilets are big and good for changing. The food is generous portion and tasted good. The cabin crew took the time to introduce the special Taiwanese delicacies to foreign passengers. The flight however is extremely long - a gruesome 13 hours. Would only recommend for service but would be a good product when they upgrade business class seats.,,,Business Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,5,P Taylor,17th September 2012,LHR-BKKK - we recently travelled with Eva Air and decided to pay the additional USD 595 per person x 4 (one way) to upgrade to Premium Economy. The additional cost was certainly not worth the money - very little extra legroom and poor inflight cabin service. Our journey home was in economy and the cabin staff were extremely helpful and friendly and having the last row of seats we had more than sufficient leg room. Our advise would be 'don't pay the extra for little or no extra comfort'.,,,Premium Economy,,,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,,2,no
EVA Air customer review,6,G Virdi,13th September 2012,London to Bangkok and return. Good new plane all female stewardesses. Food was very bland and basic in comparison to other regional airlines good legroom clean toilets. Drinks are available upon request.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,,3,yes
EVA Air customer review,10,J C Smith,13th September 2012,We travelled LHR to BKK Premium Laurel class. Check in was marred by a miserable non smiling member of staff. However from then on all was as we hoped for. Express lane through security to the AA lounge which we found to be spacious and quiet. The food was limited but otherwise fine. Boarding was quick and efficient. The seats on the aircraft are not fully lie flat but we found that we could make a reasonably comfortable bed with the cushions provided. Service and food was first rate cabin crew was attentive but not intrusive. It felt great to be addressed by our name. Apart from the obvious return leg we will fly EVA again and will be happy to recommend.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5,yes
EVA Air customer review,10,Chris Francis,9th September 2012,We flew from LHR to BNE on 29th August. The plane was a new 777 with plenty of leg room; the service throughout was of a high standard and all connections on time. I would have no hesitation in recommending this airline.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,5,yes
EVA Air customer review,10,E Guitberg,31st August 2012,Toronto-Taipei-Fukuoka. Low cost airline with exceptional service. Their prices have gone up recently but if you manage to get a cheap flight with them the value for the money can't be beat. Excellent service excellent food good in-flight entertainment and timely departures. Not a very well known airline but highly recommended.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
EVA Air customer review,9,D Taggart,31st August 2012,London to Bangkok. Good seat legroom and width for economy. Modern 777 - 300ER airplane. Good selection of movies. The food (second meal served) was not as good this trip as others previously but although unappealing (omelette and a microwave sausage) still edible. Staff polite and friendly. Service on time with no delays. Overall good value for money and has the benefit of being a direct flight between London and Bangkok.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,,5,yes
EVA Air customer review,9,M Ghafouri,29th August 2012,We went to Singapore from Vancouver in July (2012). We travelled with our 4 year old daughter. The staff were nice and the customer service excellent. The inflight entertainment was good and kept our toddler happy. The food was also good. Our Vancouver to Taipei flight was with a 747 so the seats were a little narrow and less roomy but I think that's to be expected with older 747s. The Taipei to Singapore journey was in a 777 so the seats were much more roomy. I'd recommend flying with EVA and we will definitely fly with them again.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,9,Jan Lewington,28th August 2012,Attentive staff in all areas from check in to flight attendants. This was replicated in Brisbane Taipei Bangkok and Heathrow. Both ways. However immigration cards were not given to us prior to arriving at Heathrow even though I did ask for them. I was told by attendant that we didn't need them! No point of having Express passage through immigration if you have not got that card filled out and have to go to one side and fill it out.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5,yes
EVA Air customer review,10,R Tan,28th August 2012,CGK-TPE-LAX. FAs proactively greeted passengers during boarding and attentively offered assistance with baggage. During the meal service FAs were friendly and courteous. Coffee and tea were offered thrice during and after each meal. Drinks were offered every hour or so. The meals were great in terms of quantity and quality. However the IFE system could use some improvements in terms of its selections. The magazine is also mainly in Mandarin. Also no hot towels service. Overall I am very impressed with EVA.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,5,yes
EVA Air customer review,2,Sieu Hoon Quah,9th August 2012,Our party of 6 booked Premium Economy Singapore - Vancouver 1 July and back Seattle - Singapore 20 July both via Taipei. No issues with the flight out on 1 July to Vancouver. Return leg Seattle - Taipei in Premium Economy but we were put in Economy Taipei - Singapore. We paid for and our eticket itinerary clearly stated Premium Economy all the way. Thus we felt short changed when we discovered we were to be in Economy on the Taipei - Singapore leg. In fact we changed our original date from 19 to 20 Jul as we were told by the agent that there was no Premium Economy configuration on the earlier date. We had no problems when we flew the same itinerary in 2011 but this incident has certainly left us with a bad impression of how EVA Air treats its customers. No advance notice and no apologies whatsoever. Its a pity as we have enjoyed travelling with EVA Air but we will have to look to other airlines when we make our annual trip to Seattle/Vancouver in 2013.,,,Premium Economy,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,2,no
EVA Air customer review,9,E Anselmo,9th August 2012,SEA-TPE Y class upper deck of a 747 then TPE-MNL Y class lower deck and vice-versa coming back. Seats on the trip from Seattle were a little stiff but offered an IFE for each person. Seating from Taipei much more comfortable even though the plane had a seemingly older cabin. Food was quite good if a bit gelatinous. IFE system was there for the long-distance flight; however the shorter hop did not have seatback IFEs. IFE itself was good. On the upper deck the IFE box sits underneath the B and E seats. It wasn't a bother for me as I'm only 5'5 but for extra tall people you'll have to fit your feet around it. The only real detriment I see for the airline is it's quality of English that's spoken by FAs. However minor qualms as face-to-face talking is very easy. All in all a very good choice for people looking to get to Asia without having to look at pricier alternatives.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,,5,yes
EVA Air customer review,8,Craig Scott,6th August 2012,I regularly fly London Heathrow to Bangkok and have always used British Airways until this latest trip due to a ridiculous and inexplicable rise in fares at BA. Staff are extremely professional whilst being friendly and are helpful if required. My ratings are not higher because of a few small areas that could be improved such as difficulty hearing intercom announcements Chinese subtitles on movies (though excellent selection available) a little bit more alcohol availability. Finally I know it shouldn't matter but the stewardesses smile which makes flying more pleasant for me! BA really need to lift their game as I find no reason to accept their higher prices now.,,,Premium Economy,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,10,G James,1st August 2012,Wonderful cabin crew. Very kind when I got on in a bit of a mess having run halfway across Taipei airport to catch the Brisbane connection due to a late arrival. Am fussy about my food but ate enough of what was provided not to feel hungry. AA lounge in Heathrow very disappointing - they do not cater for passengers of late flights shutting at 9 pm. Qantas at Brisbane by contract was wonderful as was Evergreen at Taipei. Seats were comfortable for sleeping even though not flat bed. Would definitely fly them again although the 5 hour stopover at Taiwan was a bit too long! LHR to BNE via Bangkok and Taiwan.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,5,yes
EVA Air customer review,10,G Goodway,1st August 2012,LHR-BKK. Overall excellent. On time. Good service in the aircraft and on the ground. Changed the date of my return flight without problem. Good lounge at both BKK and LHR. Excellent price for the experience. No negative points to report.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,5,yes
EVA Air customer review,10,Julie Guile,26th July 2012,We used Eva Elite Class 2 weeks ago from LHR-BKK for our honeymoon to Thailand and they were fantastic. My husband has a bad nut allergy and they couldn't have been more helpful with meals to suit. Service was well presented. On our return we experienced an unexpected area of bad turbulence and with me being a terrible flyer got a little upset the stewardess calmed me down and kept a close eye on me. After an hour the captain came and introduced himself explaining the reason for the 'bumpy air'. A lovely touch for a nervous flyer.,,,Premium Economy,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5,yes
EVA Air customer review,10,A Thurstance,16th July 2012,LHR-TPE-LHR. Very comfortable wide seats - best I've encountered in economy class. Flights both ways were on schedule. Crew were friendly and helpful. Food offered was good quality and there was plenty of it. Soft drinks were readily available as was wine and beer with the meals. Overall very impressed with EVA and will use them again.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,8,William McKinlay,4th July 2012,LHR- BKK return. I didn't care much for the in flight catering but there was nothing else I would criticise. I'm using the airline again later this year but I may take some sandwiches! Terminal 3 at Heathrow is still in need of some improvement.,,,Premium Economy,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,8,A J Cushion,21st June 2012,LHR-BKK-LHR. I've used Eva for approx 10 years the inflight service has always been ok. The IFE System is ok nothing compared to Etihad or Singapore. The reclining seats in Elite are very good. The food though was the worst I've ever had on a flight. I had seat 23C on both trips. There was water orange and apple juice available throughout the flight with sandwiches and nuts brought around the once. Midway on the flight I strolled to the back of the plane to have a stretch. For the price I would always recommend Elite Class.,,,Premium Economy,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,5,R Welgraven,18th June 2012,Last month I flew AMS-BKK-AMS on EVA. On my way to BKK the cabin crew appeared to be very tired. They were not friendly and even rude to a fellow passenger. I bought Elite-class tickets but in my experience I did not get Elite-class service. My flight BKK-AMS was better. The cabin staff were not as tired but not friendly either. They don't make real contact with the passengers on board and just ask the most essential questions like pork or chicken. Don't know if this is a lack of not speaking well-enough English or they are just not interested. For me EVA-air is not a 4 star airline.,,,Premium Economy,,,3.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,,2,no
EVA Air customer review,8,Mike Villanueva,13th June 2012,SEA-TPE-BKK - Elite Class. The additional money you pay for Elite Class is worth the less cramped cabin and comfortable seat. Seats on 747-400 in Elite Class have been replaced with the same seats used on the 777 allowing for you to recline slightly and raise your feet. I found it comfortable and was able to sleep. IFE had numerous movies and music. Meals were advertised on a menu card. Amount was enough to keep me full and they offer snacks if you ask for it such as instant noodles. Alcohol is served if requested but not offered as readily as done on domestic US flights. Flight attendants speak English quite well. For the TPE-BKK segment there were attendants that spoke Thai and Thai newspapers are offered as well. On SEA-TPE segment a comfort kit is provided. Bathrooms are kept clean and well stocked. Flight attendants were polite friendly and helpful. I would recommend this airline to Thailand or Taiwan if flying Elite Class.,,,Premium Economy,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,8,Kiki Muchtar,10th June 2012,Good service (very attentive and friendly flight attendants); so-so food. From CGK to TPE passenger could choose a wider economy seat (located in the front of the plane) which is very comfortable. Standard economy seat is not bad though. Entertainment channels for long-haul flight (i.e. TPE-LAX) is better than the short one. Restroom is clean most of the time.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,10,Denis Desautels,27th May 2012,Travelled from Vancouver to Singapore with a stop over in Taipei. The level of service at the airports and onboard was above expectations. The seats were very comfortable and the meals above average. Ultimately a 12 hours flight that did not seem so long with a great connection. Both segments left on time and arrived early. EVA Air tops our list for travel to Asia.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
EVA Air customer review,7,D Ford,8th May 2012,LHR-BKK-LHR. As Premier Laurel was fully booked and I had to stick to a schedule for meetings I opted for Premium Economy. I use an iPad for movies so did not use the IFE system but everyone else seemed to be enjoying it also I did not eat on either of the flights but drinks were plentiful and the Cabin Staff excellent in frequent drink and snack runs. My only complaint about the flights was that the A/C in the cabin was turned down so low that a lot of people were complaining about the cold. This does seem to be a money saving move by many airline nowadays but there are limits as to how much cold you should expect passengers to endure on a 12-13 hour flight. Had the A/C been set to a more comfortable level my rating would have been higher.,,,Premium Economy,,,3.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,9,K Chen,8th May 2012,TPE-NRT on a brand-new A330-300 which happens to be one of the Hello Kitty jets. From boarding to deboarding there was not a dull moment. Everything is branded with Hello Kitty from the luggage tags to the boarding pass to the pillows cutlery and the safety instruction card. Even the toilet paper has Hello Kitty on it! Flight attendants wear pink Hello Kitty ribbons and accessories. Staff are professional and friendly responding quickly to your needs. When I asked for a second meal I got it within a minute! The food is good quality and good portion. The seats are comfortable with adequate leg room. Seats are arranged 2-4-2. I didn't watch any movies or listen to music but the flight tracking system is the best I've seen. Overall an excellent and very fun flight experience as the airline really put the excitement back into flying with this Hello Kitty marketing campaign!,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,9,Bruce Curry,2nd May 2012,LHR to Brisbane return. A great experience at a very good price. The food wine and service were excellent. The seats were very comfortable. Although they can't be made fully flat we had plenty of sleep. You can adjust them easily to get a comfortable position. I agree with other reviewers about the AA lounge at Heathrow Terminal 3 although the staff were not surly as had been suggested. EVA lounges at BKK and Taipei are good as is the Qantas lounge at Brisbane.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,,5,yes
EVA Air customer review,8,R Galoubet,1st May 2012,LHR-BKK-LHR. Service has been improving over the years although this time I had a prolonged and embarrassing argument with check-in staff about overweight cabin baggage. I'm a vegan and have suffered from the dreadful Chinese veggie dishes they used to serve up. But recently the food has greatly improved with non Chinese vegan dishes and huge helpings of fresh fruit. Excellent espresso coffee. Cabin staff pretty faultless. Boeing 777-300ER is an excellent plane. The big seats are fine for sitting and relaxing. My only gripe is with the fixed distance video screen which inconveniently lies mid-way between the focus of my distance and reading glasses so the films are always a bit blurred! I like EVA's BKK-LHR schedule which leaves around 1pm. Much better than BA Qantas and Thai that leave in the middle of the night.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,5,yes
EVA Air customer review,5,Paul Kennington,15th April 2012,LHR-BKK return. The 777-300 in economy the experience was comfortable and indeed professional but it still lacked what we have come to expect from decent scheduled carriers. Cabin staff were efficient but the lack of little extras made the trip frustrating. No hot towels no pre-meal drinks service no menu card to choose from great difficulty in getting alcoholic drinks during the flight (impossible on the return flight despite repeatedly asking). They will have to up their game before we will consider booking them again.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,,4,no
EVA Air customer review,9,R Oussalah,14th April 2012,B777 Business Class CDG-TPE-CDG. Check-in a little messy with only 1 counter for Laurel Premium Class at Paris airport. Boarding smooth. Flight attendants very pleasant throughout. The seats although can't recline flat are very comfortable. 2-2-2 configuration so very different from European airlines with 2-3-2 in business. Food was ok nothing special. IFE is decent and in line with industry standards.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,5,yes
EVA Air customer review,6,Steve Dennis,14th April 2012,"LHR-BKK-LHR. Have flown most carriers on this route and EVA is overall pretty good. IFE system (in premium economy anyway) has now had a very significant upgrade and is much better Overall the 2 flights were good value for money but unlike the ""old days"" when the airline was young there was nothing outstanding to praise. I will fly again if the ticket prices stay reasonable.",,,Premium Economy,,,4.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,,3,yes
EVA Air customer review,4,C Green,11th April 2012,My wife and I have travelled on most of the long haul carriers when we fly to the Far East. We booked Premium Economy I have got to say we were very disappointed with the little things that we have grown accustomed to when flying long haul. Passengers were not given a hot/cold towel when settling down there was no Menu and the choice had to be made when the trolley arrived. There was not an offer of a drink throughout the flight except with the meal and that was only wine. We will be looking at another airline next year.,,,Premium Economy,,,4.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,,3,no
EVA Air customer review,9,J Matthews,11th April 2012,HKG-TPE return economy. Excellent flight on both legs.

EVA Air customer review,9,Ron Kuhlmann,10th April 2012,Very pleasant flight from TPE-SFO. Crew was very friendly though during the dinner service they seemed a bit disorganized. There was no cart service and each passenger was given courses as needed there were some odd gaps but the food was good and the breakfast excellent. Primarily read so did not use the IFE too much but the selection was good and the seat ok for sleeping.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
EVA Air customer review,8,M McGrath,2nd April 2012,LHR-BKK. 777-300 ER Premium Laurel (Business class). Shared American Airlines lounge at Terminal 3 quite basic compared to BA. No queue at check-in and we boarded first. Seat is comfortable and quite wide (2-2-2 configuration). No champagne offered before takeoff. Meal service (we pre-ordered off website) was more on a par with BA. Wine was ok. Movie selection was up to date and plentiful. Breakfast served before BKK was delicious. A lot of the FAs had some difficulty with English. They provide an extra large pillow and a comfortable duvet which helped the sleeping. Excellent value for money and I would definitely use again.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,5,yes
EVA Air customer review,6,R Simpson,27th March 2012,Vancouver to Taipei on 747-400 in economy class. Seats were terrible narrow and very hard. An upgrade to elite economy is a must on this plane. Taipei to HCMC on a 777 - much better seats. On the 12+ hr. flight the entertainment could be better as it seems all planes have the same selection. All flights on time. Probably time to get rid of 747's.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,3,no
EVA Air customer review,9,T Dawson,21st March 2012,LHR-BKK-LHR. Very comfortable seat food very good and well-conceived menu: choice of Chinese and western mains. Crew very pleasant unobtrusive and efficient. Particularly appreciated that they were available at all times and kept the toilets spotlessly clean. We both slept 6 hours on the outbound night flight so no complaints from us regarding the angle seats.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5,yes
EVA Air customer review,7,J Cullen,21st March 2012,Seated in premium economy. Seats have plenty of leg room. Usual blanket and pillow provided with a few extras. Was really annoyed with the headphones - although they were adjustable they do not fit comfortably. Service was ok but certainly not exceptional - they missed me out twice on the drinks run and smiles were limited. We found the food very poor (equivalent to short haul quality). Taking your own sandwiches is a better option!,,,Premium Economy,,,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,,3,yes
EVA Air customer review,6,D Craig,19th March 2012,London to Bangkok return in Elite class. Pretty good value for money fast track boarding seats reasonably comfortable although manual controls were a little annoying. A foot rest would have made a lot of difference. Good choice of films food unremarkable. Plane on time both ways. Asked for a beer 8 hours into flight and received icy smile and the stewardess never came back asked another stewardess 30 mins later and was told beer had run out and was not offered anything else. Would fly again but for schedule and cost rather than inflight experience.,,,Premium Economy,,,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,,4,no
EVA Air customer review,10,Ian Roberts,8th March 2012,LHR-BKK-LHR. Really good value for money! Flight out delayed but arrived on time. Inflight was faultless - the snack bar very handy though the friendly crew on hand. Food fine - all on china but oddly plastic knives. IFE worked well with a wide choice. Previous comment re the non lie flat-I find the 'relax' setting better and prefer the extra space it allows. Fast track at both airports almost worth the ticket price alone. With a product like this BA should take note as not much more than their traveller plus and well worth the extra.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5,yes
EVA Air customer review,10,Ian Roberts,8th March 2012,LHR-BKK-LHR. Really good value for money! Flight out delayed but arrived on time. Inflight was faultless - the snack bar very handy though the friendly crew on hand. Food fine - all on china but oddly plastic knives. IFE worked well with a wide choice.

EVA Air customer review,7,B Hearn,29th February 2012,LHR-BKK return. Check-in fast and efficient both ways. Bangkok airport was clean fast and effective. I found seats had plenty of legroom in economy but you are advised to check online that you are not sitting in a seat with the inflight entertainment boxes underneath. Staff were reasonable but elusive at times. The food was above average and good for airline standard. My only complaints are freezing cold cabin on the Boeing 747-300-ER and poor inflight entertainment system which was the same on both routes and had limited choices.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,9,M Painter,27th February 2012,"Los Angeles to Taipei. I was impressed with the service and leg room. The flight attendance made rounds frequently to offer water and juice and sometimes snacks. There was plenty of leg room very comfortable for me at 5' 9"". I chose EVA because it was the best rate at the time.",,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
EVA Air customer review,8,K Peng,21st February 2012,BNE-TPE on A332. Flight was punctual. The crew friendly and run regular water runs between two meals. The meals were delicious and the Asian options taste authentically Taiwanese. PTV was not touch screen and the remote was a bit difficult to use. The selection for movies and TV shows was somehow petty. Overall it was a good flight and I would fly with EVA again.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,6,Duncan Whiting,20th February 2012,LHR-BKK return. Outbound sat in 43C which had a large IFE box located on the floor under the seat in front dramatically reducing legroom. IFE offerings were limited and unimaginative. EVA no longer do the pre-dinner drinks run it's wine or beer with your meal and that's it.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,,3,no
EVA Air customer review,9,G Stefansson,17th February 2012,London-Bangkok return. Check-in London and Bangkok welcoming flights on time and service onboard excellent except on the return leg it was cold in the cabin. We complained a number of times and staff said they had troubles controlling the temperature. Would fly with them again if they still offer reasonable price.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,,5,yes
EVA Air customer review,7,J Tydeman,10th February 2012,Flew to Bangkok en route to Siem Reap from London. In the main we thought this was a good flight with helpful crew and fairly good food. The IFE was not very good at all and needs updating to compete with the best airlines. The boarding at Heathrow was a bit chaotic though but check-in was quick and efficient.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,8,J Hodgkin,8th February 2012,LHR-BKK return. Food average a bit hit and miss. Wine selection poor. Positives - Flight attendants very efficient. Angled flat seat actually very comfortable in upright or relax mode. Modern clean Boeing 777's used on the sector. Relatively good value for money at £1520 return. Lounges average AA lounge LHR EVA Lounge BKK (decent selection of snacks at BKK).,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,9,Jill Barter,31st January 2012,Flew to Bangkok return. Excellent and helpful cabin staff. Very comfortable in Business Class with a good selection of films/music. We were very well looked after. The only let down was terminal 3 at Heathrow!,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,7,M Bentley,21st January 2012,Although the trip was very long the staff and food was good my one bone of contention was how hard the seats were - they were so uncomfortable they made the flight from Taipei to London an endurance test rather than part of an enjoyable holiday experience.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,4,no
EVA Air customer review,8,A Turner,9th January 2012,LHR to BKK. Have flown EVA many times and have watched prices creep up but still good value for direct flights. Have always flown premium economy and business and would say premium economy is worth the extra. Last time I checked in at LHR business class desk was open early and they were happy to check me onto the flight even though I was booked in premium economy. The food is the same as economy but it's not bad and was happily served alcohol when I asked for it.,,,Premium Economy,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,5,yes
EVA Air customer review,9,M Salcedo-Gomez,6th January 2012,FUK-TPE-FUK. Check-in fast and convenient orderly boarding process nice interiors A330-300 neat and comfortable. I was surprised with the generous leg space in economy class not as cramped as expected I could easily stretch without disturbing others. Meals offered with smiles food was delicious with complimentary ice cream. Breakfast offered on the inbound flight was lovely. In general an excellent airline.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,8,Henry Firman,5th January 2012,London Heathrow to Bangkok and on to Taipei using their Premium Laurel (business class) service. Service is good with a few anomalies such as a main meal and breakfast even if you arrive 8.00pm local time. Seats have lots of leg room but are not as good as full flat sleeper seats. They have replaced the seat base cushions and are a bit uncomfortable. The other annoyance is the headphones which hurt your ears after extended use. Our flight out was delayed causing us to miss a connecting Thai air flight (luggage checked through at Heathrow) the airlines couldn't have done more to help putting us up in a superb hotel overnight and flying us the next day.,,,Business Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,6,D Greer,2nd January 2012,JFK-HKG-JFK November 2011. While premium economy is a good value it lacks service. Food is economy and fair at best - only expect to be offered wine or alcohol during meal service. Crew do come often with water and juice. While seat pitch is good similar to domestic F-class seats are almost as narrow as economy and the leg rest is of little use. Found highly rated 777 seats in rows 23 to have significant vibration and noise over the wing. Cabin and lavatories are kept clean and fresh. Beware JFK-TPE route that stops for fuel in Alaska adds 2-3 hours.,,,Premium Economy,,,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,8,M Channon,22nd December 2011,LHR-BKK-LHR. Check-in at LHR and BKK was quick and smooth. On the outgoing flight check-in staff were able to block a full row for my partner and I. The food is fine and the drinks plentiful. I remember travelling with EVA when wine was dispensed from Tetra pack cartons thankfully this has ceased and we now have decent wine from bottles! I will fly again with EVA they provide as competitive a service as Thai with the added bonus of IFE which is hugely important on a long haul flight and much cheaper than BA or Qantas.,,,Premium Economy,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,9,R Tan,19th December 2011,LAX-TPE-CGK. The flight attendant went the extra mile when I requested a window seat she came back 10 minutes later informing me of a vacant window seat. Both flights were very full. IFE was sufficient although more selections should be added. Meals were mediocre. Overall EVA offers a decent product for the price they are charging.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,,5,yes
EVA Air customer review,9,J Ysla,14th December 2011,"MNL-LAX-MNL. It was the cheapest flight at that time. Overall experience is excellent except for the food. Unlike other airlines where they will give ""enough"" to satisfy your hunger while in a long haul flight this airline will just give you small servings of everything. Whenever you have a long hours of layover (ours was 9 hours before we had our TPE-LAX connecting flight) they will provide you with a food voucher per passenger to use during the layover.",,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,,5,yes
EVA Air customer review,5,Charles Teo,7th December 2011,My expectation of this airline was high however I was disappointed with the poor service on 3 of my 4 flights. Cabin crews were lacking warmth and manners. A few of them were ok but the rest didn't seem to be happy. Food was disappointing the only positive thing was the comfort of the seat . I am 6 ft 4 legroom space was important and I got that in the Elite Class. I flew SIN-TPE-SIN sector. This airline has the potential to make a top airline a real pity really.,,,Premium Economy,,,4.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,,3,no
EVA Air customer review,9,C Chua,1st December 2011,NRT-TPE-SIN- return. I am thoroughly impressed. Seat felt rich with foam and fabric was very comfortable and not scratchy at all. I slept very well. Food was tasty and came in generous portions. Flight attendants were very warm even though some cannot understand you linguistically they were very patient to identify what you need. Too bad most EVA flights transit in Taiwan which is a boring old airport.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,0.0,,5,yes
EVA Air customer review,7,S Caudwell,30th November 2011,LHR to BKK return. Business Class service is good value for money. FA's are excellent lounge at LHR utilised American Airlines (average) but the lounge at BKK was EVA's own and better. IFE is good but not 5 star. Noticed sound cancelling headphones on return flight were missing but quality was still acceptable. The only downside is the seats. I don't mind the old lazy-boy style seats but the EVA Air ones are neither this or lie- flat. I found it nearly impossible to sleep and generally uncomfortable. I'm not overly tall or wide.,,,Business Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,8,J Pina,22nd November 2011,LHT-BKK return. Good value for money. Good leg space which is very important on such a long trip. FA's attentive and polite with several rounds offering water and juices. Food average but tasteful enough for plane food. Flight entertainment quite modern. Check-in and luggage delivery very efficient. A good experience with a very reasonable price.,,,Premium Economy,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,8,Keith Slater,10th November 2011,LHR-BKK return in Premium Laurel Business Class. Check-in very quick and efficient and the American Business Lounge in LHR is very good. Polite friendly and attentive cabin crew on both flights and food was good for airline facilities. Cabin spacious and quiet film choice quite good. The only downside are the seats as others have commented. The tilt is good but not flat and although we both got some sleep not as much as we'd liked. If you get extra pillows/duvets you can build up the footrest to almost level. The Eva Air lounge in Bangkok doesn't open until 10 am - but is very good with great range of snacks and hot food.,,,Business Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,8,D Maton,1st November 2011,LHR-BKK return. Check-in online and easy bag drop at LHR. Cabin crew polite and efficient. Food of average quality with 2 choices of main meal. No alcoholic beverages offered but supplied on request. Seating fairly good for economy class. Return crew again polite and efficient. Food on this leg very disappointing. AVOD choices limited on both legs. EVA offer excellent value for money and would use again if the price was right.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,,5,yes
EVA Air customer review,9,S Gavigan,27th October 2011,LHR-BKK return in Premium Laurel. Checked in at LHR with American Airlines staff and made use of the AA lounge - food selection poor however plenty of free drink and comfortable enough. The flight was good seat comfortable and spacious and managed to sleep in the angled flat position. The food was good and I had pre ordered using their website. Cabin crew friendly aircraft and toilet clean. Fast track pass issued before landing for BKK. On return leg used EVA lounge at BKK small lounge with basic food selection but comfortable. Return was a daytime flight I stayed awake and they were more than happy to bring drinks when called. Movie selection was good.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,5,yes
EVA Air customer review,6,O Thompson,23rd October 2011,LHR-BKK. For what you pay it is excellent. Great leg room good IFE clean modern aircraft. Only gripes would be less than attentive cabin crew and they insist on having the shutters closed on a 12 hour day flight.,,,Premium Economy,,,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,,5,yes
EVA Air customer review,10,Bob Carver,23rd October 2011,The 4th time we have flown LHR-BKK with EVA and this time we upgraded to premium laurel. LHR American Airlines lounge okay. Cabin staff great and spoke good English. Food and drinks of good quality. You really are spoilt compared to our good experiences in Elite. They even call you by your name. Much has been made of the angled flat bed seating but slept for 5 hours outbound. An idea is not to put the seat flat but use all the electric adjustments to get comfy. I believe the EVA product is outstanding value for money. Priority immigration and security documents are issued to premium laurel passengers. Even bags are priority. Check in at BKK for return was excellent and the EVA lounge at the airport was good - small but with excellent refreshments and staff. You can order your meals online before you go - had congee on both sectors great stuff.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5,yes
EVA Air customer review,9,J Samuells,28th September 2011,LHR-BKK return. Excellent on-time service both ways with attentive cabin crew. Food could have been better but plenty of soft drinks offered. Beer was available - you only had to ask. Seating was comfortable and inflight entertainment could not have been better.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,4,B Stokes,26th September 2011,LHR-BKK return. Although EVA AIR Premium do give you lots more legroom the rest of the flights were poor. This airline does not appear to want to give you any alcoholic drinks. All they do is offer you water and juice. The cabin crew are ok but nothing special. The food was awful and worse still plastic cutlery kid size. On flight BKK-LHR (a day flight) the afternoon meal was a breakfast. Flight crew welcomed us onboard when on the final approach on both flights. You do get a better seat but that is all.,,,Premium Economy,,,,,,,,1,no
EVA Air customer review,9,O Hayman,15th September 2011,Fantastic non-stop flight to BKK from LHR. Third time I have used EVA and have never had a bad experience. The film selection was good and the other entertainment such as music and games were good too. Seats in Economy were comfy and I will definitely be flying them again.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,8,P Heath,10th September 2011,BNE-LHR return Premium Laurel Class. We chose EVA on the basis of ticket pricing and were not disappointed. Whilst we found the website less than helpful we did find dealing through a travel agent was the way to go. You must accept that the trip will take a little longer however the planes are modern and the seating arrangement the same as the more expensive airlines. In Premium Laurel Class the seats whilst a little hard are good and leg room ample. We found that by placing a pillow at the small of the back we got good a good sleeping position which allowed 10 hrs of good rest over each of the forward and return trips. Food was very good and drinks readily available. The best part is the attention that is afforded by the cabin staff who are most attentive and contributed to a very comfortable experience.,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,10,Ben Smith,1st September 2011,LHR-BKK return. Plane was brand new 777-300ER on-time both ways. Cabin crew great  tasty food. Good value for money considering the service we received.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,8,E Chiang,30th August 2011,New York to Taipei seat 7A. I found everything overall was great cabin crew were nice and paid attention to my every need. Entertainment options are varied with TV Shows movies games and music. Food was great. Though many people have problems with the seat when trying to sleep I found that sleeping in the Relaxed position offered by the automated seat controls is just as good as the Sleeping option offered. My one big problem was the headsets for some reason so matter what I do after using them for a few movies my ears start to hurt.,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,6,D Suryadi,30th August 2011,Fight attendants helpful and friendly good seat and food unfortunately I found this flight had poor entertainment options. Magazines were not in English. Movies shown on large monitors overhead with few music stations.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,no
EVA Air customer review,9,Tim Page,23rd August 2011,LHR-BKK B777-300ER 3x3x3 seat format. Row 62 HJK seats. All H seats limited under seat and legroom due to inflight entertainment kit. Flew to Bangkok return good value for a direct flight to Bangkok. Economy seats comfortable and good width with adequate recline. Inflight English entertainment with lots of choice. Food excellent and drinks frequent. Flight staff attentive. Only things of minor irritation was an inability to control air flow and they insisted on lowering window blinds even though it was a day return trip to London.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,,S Pepper,19th August 2011,LAX-Indonesia return. Trapped in an uncomfortable poorly equipped smelly plane for 18 hr journey each way. Flight attendants were inattentive and rude food was inedible seats were uncomfortable and media selections were extremely poor. I've now learnt that schedule and price alone should not have been the driving factors in my decision to try EVA.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1,no
EVA Air customer review,10,H Thompson,14th August 2011,LHR-BKK return. Easy check-in no problem with seating and had the seats requested. Staff very attentive onboard - they brought drinks round every 30mins. Food was good with a variety of drinks offered including alcohol. On BKK-LHR two full meals served. Inflight entertainment covered a range of options while not as comprehensive as Emirates ICE system there was a good choice of viewing.,,,Premium Economy,,,,,,,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,10,Ofelia T Cabasal,11th August 2011,I bought 2 adult tickets from Manila to San Francisco. Employees helped me by looking for the cheapest fare they were professional yet friendly. Ground crew were very good. At Taiwan airport I was surprised to see all the improvements they've made.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,8,M Russell,4th August 2011,Check in and Fast Track were both very efficient as were the cabin crews on both legs. Minor gripes are the 'Complimentary Toiletries' whose content appeared designed for young children rather than Business Class passengers and a very mediocre lounge at Bangkok. Main Meal on the return leg was rather bland but for the overall price paid was more than acceptable.,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,9,Ian Suttie,4th August 2011,LHR-BKK-LHR. Service good in Premium Laurel class but unfortunately the seats are only reclining and not lie-flat. I found them less than comfortable and sleep did not come easy. Food was good but butter quite frozen rather than refrigerated. Check-in at LHR fast and efficient. Check-in via fast track at BKK was even quicker. Lounges on both sites were clean and comfortable.,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,6,P Nunn,1st August 2011,EVA economy LRH-BKK-LHR (B777-300). Reserved my seats online as I like to fly aisle seats called 3 days before to confirm it was all ok. On check-in no problem but as about to enter security was paged back to check in when I arrived I was told there was a problem and I would have to move seats. I told them I was not happy and they decided to upgrade me to Premium Economy but a window seat. I was not that impressed by what you get extra and did not find the seats comfy at all. Cabin crew on way out very poor. On return got the seat I had booked and cabin crew were a lot better. AVOD could be better with more recent movies to select from. Plane full both ways booked this as wanted to fly direct this time maybe I will go back to connection flights in the future.,,,Premium Economy,,,,,,,,1,no
EVA Air customer review,9,L Ralte,31st July 2011,Taipei to Bangkok. They mentioned on their website that one has to show the credit card with which their ticket was bought and was worried about that as I had used a friends credit card and didn't carry it with me. But at Taipei check in none of those happened. The check in staff was friendly and he had even waived off my excess weight beyond the 20kg limit. Also they could through check in my entire luggages till Calcutta which was my final destionation. The flight took about 4hours wasn't eventful. Food was alright. IFE a good collection of movies/tv shows. Flight attendants looked great in their green uniforms they were attentive and helfpul.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,7,F Bouchard,28th July 2011,TPE-BKK. Inefficient boarding followed by an enjoyable flight. Flight attendants were attentive food was good and IFE was sufficient. I am 6'3 and found the seating rather cramped with uncomfortable seat cushions.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,7,M Chamberlain,27th July 2011,LHR-BKK check in was easy and I had pre-booked my seat on line. Seats could be a bit bigger but I have never had any major issues. Food is ok and the service of a decent level. Wish they would be a bit more generous with alcohol but never been any issues when asked. Flight arrived about 30 mins early.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,8,I Mirza,24th July 2011,Flew LHR-BKK return and found them to be a good airline at a reasonable price. Business Class cabin was very roomy and did not feel at all crowded. Planes very clean and modern. Seats while not fully flat (slight angle) were comfortable and I was able to grab 4-5 hrs sleep each way. Film choices while not amazing were ok and full AVOD. Cabin crew very professional and offered very attentive service. Bar and snack area set up during flight so you can help yourself to wine beer spirits and food during the flight. My seat on the return journey did not work quickly dealt with and were moved to other seats in the cabin. Would use them again on this route as the price is very good and the service was great just make them flat beds not angled flat beds.,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,4,C Diaz,18th July 2011,LHR-BKK. They are reluctant to offer alcohol and only offer water orange juice or apple juice in small quantities. I asked for a can of cola - flight attendant opened a can poured less than half of it into a glass put the can on her trolley and walked off. Food portions are small. Forget about requesting a seat when you book. That counts for nothing because at the end of the day check-in staff do not care about a specific seat request. Furthermore on two occasions when I managed to get the seats I requested by getting to the airport early I was hassled onboard by staff who wanted me to give up my seating so other guys could sit together. Finally why so many American movies?,,,Premium Economy,,,,,,,,1,no
EVA Air customer review,9,Phil Carey,3rd July 2011,LHR-BKK return in Business (Premium Laurel) Class. Full cabins on both outward and return journeys but good layout meant did not feel crowded. B777 aircraft in both cases seemed virtually brand new with comfortable seat albeit not quite managing flat-bed status. All meals of good quality served efficiently and with charm by young female crew coping well with some extensive turbulence. Check-in at both LHR and BKK was speedy and use of EVA's own lounge in BKK and the American Airlines lounge at LHR T3 made the journeys an enjoyable experience all round. Most importantly an excellent value product at £1500 for the part-flexible return ticket.,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,5,Katie L Fallon,26th June 2011,We (2 adults 2 kids) flew from LHR-BKK. The check in procedure was quick with no queues. My two complaints are the temperature on the outbound flight was absolutely freezing. No matter how hard I tried to snuggle up in the blanket I just couldn't get warm which made it quite an unpleasant flight. The second was the food. It was pretty awful. The staff were quite friendly but nothing like Singapore Airlines or Virgin. In flight entertainment was much better on the return flight. I think because we went out in May and back in June it was different. It made the return flight almost bearable. Check in in BKK was the slowest I've ever known. Quite a few of us were at the airport 4 hrs before but it didn't open until 3 hrs before and even then it was extremely slow. When checking in at LHR the desk was open well in advance of the 3 hrs. Overall EVA are ok and we flew with them as they were cheapest and my agent said they were better than Thai Airways. Maybe we'll give Thai a try next time to see for ourselves!,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,no
EVA Air customer review,7,B Smith,6th June 2011,LHR-BKK flights on time both ways. Food not the best I have had. Great IFE on B777-300 plane new and clean. Overall I would fly with EVA again.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,8,S Vosburgh,1st June 2011,EWR-Beijing via Taipei Shanghai Hongqiao to Taipei Shongsheng and Taipei Tayouan to EWR business class. Generally a very nice trip with attentive service good food and on excellent on board entertainment. The new lounge in Taoyuan airport Terminal 2 with nice shower and food service. The transit in Taipei to Beijing is very smooth. The flight attendants polite and attentive on-demand meals were nice. The weakest link is the angled flat bed. Not comfy for a tall person - it's definitely not the same as real flat beds that most airlines now have. Cabin clean and modern. Probably use again if they can introduce new flat bed.,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,7,M Howlett,1st June 2011,London Heathrow to Bangkok return. Check in staff at both ends very good. Eva Air in economy class do not cater for the tall customer - seats very uncomfortable. Staff onboard were good but never smiled. On the way out we weren't even offered a glass of water - on the way back it was better. The food was very poor but I didn't pay much for the seat. I guess they don't give that little bit extra.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,no
EVA Air customer review,2,K Cullimore,30th May 2011,On return from Bangkok May 27th my wife unfortunately had an accident whilst on holiday and was unable to walk unaided and was in a wheelchair however she was upgraded to business class by our insurance company as she had to have her leg in an elevated position. When we checked in at Eva Air desk the attendant told us that neither of us was upgraded through her broken English. This took a while to explain and eventually I had to telephone our insurers whilst at the check in desk to gain confirmation again for them to find our booking. They gave my wife a ticket to use in the business class lounge as only she had the upgrade but I was not allowed to accompany her even though she could not walk or look after herself so I gave the manager on duty the ticket back as they would not allow me to pay for an upgrade or wheel her into the lounge. I asked if the plane was a full flight to which she replied no. When we boarded I again asked if I could upgrade irrespective of the price and flatly told no. At one point during the flight I walked from the rear of the plane to the front into business class completely unchallenged but when I sat next to my wife in one of the many empty seats in business class I was told to return to my seat in economy class as I was upsetting the rest of the passengers. I offered to pay any price for one of the empty seats in business class and especially the two that were next to my wife. I was flatly refused and ended the entire flight separated from my wife for the 11 hours. The captain made his announcement to welcome all of us on board 9 hours into the flight. This is the first and last time I will ever fly Eva Air as I would rather pay extra to fly with any other airline as their customer service is non existent in addition to the extremely poor command of English. Equally this practice does not make commercial sense as the amount of empty seats on this flight could have been used for passengers to upgrade if they wished and therefore earning the airline extra revenue.,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,1,no
EVA Air customer review,9,Kevin Barrance,21st May 2011,Excellent service all round. Spotless planes excellent service smiling crew could not do enough to assist. Entertainment options were adequate and food was good.,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,8,I McDonnell,19th May 2011,Heathrow to Brisbane return a delight. My wife and I were treated very well on all flights. The food was excellent and nothing too much trouble. Our enforced stopover at the Monarch in Taipei was also a delight. Just one quibble perhaps it would be possible to improve the announcements from the pilot as these were practically impossible to understand due to poor English.,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,9,James Kerr,15th May 2011,London to Bangkok. Both flights on time good service lovely staff good entertainment lots of food and better quality than expected. Legroom/comfort good for economy. Excellent value for money. A much more pleasant 11 hour flight than we were anticipating!,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,10,Francis Price,26th April 2011,London to Bangkok with three young children. Good inflight entertainment very advantageous especially with children. Seat legroom respectable for economy class and EVA are good value for money. The plane was full but service and cabin crew were very good and a thoroughly enjoyable flight. Additional snacks and soft drinks available whenever we wanted them.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,8,J DeMund,25th April 2011,I have travelled EVA many times usually Premium Economy occasionally in Business and in general seats are comfy food is decent and staff is very pleasant. My complaint is about the website which is one of the worst I have ever encountered and far and away the worst airline website I have ever used. Maybe the Chinese language site works better? The English site is horrible. It took me hours to figure out and book flights. Then I couldn't select seats so I called the 800 number and was told that aisle seats were requested for me. Today 3 days before flight I got an e-mail inviting me to select seats on the website. Trying to log in using confirmation # and name (exactly as on ticket) and they couldn't find my name. Logging in with frequent flyer number and password and the system is down please try later. Please EVA upgrade the website!,,,Premium Economy,,,,,,,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,8,C Johnson,18th April 2011,London to Bangkok return. Quality of food improved from last year. Excellent meals in both directions and a very good selection of wines and champagne. Good selection of films. I don't mind the angled seats.,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,7,Streb Lovell,12th April 2011,TPE-HKG in economy then Macao-TPE with upgrade to business. Only one option for lunch on the TPE-HKG route - an awful fish dish truly inedible. I don't eat fish and the flight attendant found a tasty Hindu meal for me to eat. The lesson is to not count on them for food in economy and order a Hindu meal. Flight from Macao to TPE fine. Macao business class lounge seems stuck in the 80s but that isn't EVA's fault. You can fly into Hong Kong and out of Macao on EVA or vice versa which is very convenient. I believe EVA is the only airline where this is possible.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,6,Philip Rubenstein,27th March 2011,YYZ-TPE-BKK Premium Laurel. I used to be a regular on EVA but the service started deteriorating over the past two years and I switched to Star Alliance carriers. As well EVA has lost its cost advantage. The seats in Premium Laurel are probably the worst available. All of the negative comments posted are valid. There really is no reason for such an uncomfortable seat. Air Canada uses the same aircraft for its long haul flights and is able to offer full flat beds and maintain the same passenger capacity. EVA caters to Chinese clientele so its menus are typically slanted to Taiwan preferences. That being said the western food options have deteriorated in the past two years with blandness high fat content and overcooking being signatures of EVA's caterers. The cabin crew are decent and planes are clean. A major disappointment is the YYZ lounge. Yes it is close to the gate but it is basically a separate holding area with limited food and beverage options. It's worse than the local domestic Air Canada Star Alliance lounge. EVA does not have a customer service email for inquiries and the only way to access customer service is to call a ticketing office. The Toronto office was unhelpful. There is no ticket office open on the weekends and after 6pm. The other big issue with EVA is that of language skills. I do not speak Mandarin and most of EVA's ticket agents cabin crew and desk agents have very limited English skills. I still am fond of EVA but when an airline starts cutting corners my loyalty reduces. EVA is no longer special and it offers business class service that is at the same level as North American carriers not its Asian competitors.,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,1,no
EVA Air customer review,10,Michael Jensen,22nd March 2011,Amsterdam to Bangkok and back on B777-300 : out on a night flight and return on day flight. Even though the seats do not recline to a flat position for sleeping we got a good sleep. You get a large pillow plus duvet. Food and drinks fantastic. Wide choice of menu made even larger if you pre order on line before your flight. On board service is very good with good attention to your personal needs. In flight entertainment with a good choice of movies and music and high quality head sets.,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,7,Sergio Zappulo,18th March 2011,LHR-BKK return a lot cheaper than other non-stop flights. Flights on time new aircraft and reasonably comfortable trip. Service efficient if lacking slightly in a human touch however staff courteous and helpful. Food was a bit bland but I don't expect much more from air travel. The real negative is their strange ticket amendment policy - you cannot change the outbound date but you can change the inbound date but only after you've flown the outbound! Not sure why this is so given that they charge to change dates (which I expect from a cheap ticket) and EVA didn't seem to know either when I called them. Anyway in short it was a comfortable flight and good value for money.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,no
EVA Air customer review,8,Darren Sant,9th March 2011,Brisbane-Taipei-Paris Premium Laurel Class. Both flights great however more room on 777 then A330. Seat is not flat in sleep mode which was a bit of a pain however still managed some sleep. Food great on both flights. Cabin crew very friendly and came down aisle on both legs offering drinks and snacks. AVOD had sufficient choice to keep me occupied on both legs and the new lounge in Taipei is excellent and much better then Qantas lounge in Brisbane which EVA use.,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,6,Tim Scott,6th March 2011,LHR-BKK return Economy. Flights on time smooth check in and departures on both legs. Staff friendly and nice enough. Got a pretty decent last minute deal with EVA. What lets them down really is the food and beverage. Seating is more comfortable in a 3x3x3 economy configuration in fairly new 777-300. Leg room not bad but glad I am not over 6 foot. IFE not bad enough choices though interface is slow and crashes regularly. Food very bland disappointing with options running out on both legs. Little in the way of snacks and beverages. In fact pouring generic cheap soft drinks into cups and serving them as popular/common brands I felt was very cheeky. Overall good service if somewhat indifferent.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,9,F Wong,6th March 2011,HKG-TPE-HKG premium laurel class. The service and food quality good ambience of cabin is fine neat toilets fairly good AVOD with touch screen. Seat pitch wide and fairly comfortable although it is not properly flat - angled lie-flat does make one feel like sliding down. Staff English ability has some room for improvement but they make an effort to pamper their Biz class passengers. Airport check-in is efficient and courteous. From HKG it uses Virgin Atlantic lounge which is great. In Taipei the EVA air lounge in terminal 2 is very roomy fantastic food selections. Priority luggage handling and delivery was very efficient and prompt.,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,8,Ralph Goldsen,4th March 2011,I've been flying EVA for 8 years. I have been a gold card member for most of that time. The weak link in EVA is its customer service. When I have to deal with a live person and am lucky enough to get through by telephone they rarely speak English comfortably and they have the Taiwanese attitude about customers - if you don't like their policies or decisions too bad for you. I think this is getting worse. heir upgrade policies are not written in standard English and when ambiguous they are construed against the customer. My wife and I will be trying new carriers if we are able to use our many accumulated miles and clear the balance sheet with EVA.,,,Premium Economy,,,,,,,,4,no
EVA Air customer review,9,S Dambrauskas,28th February 2011,The seats were pretty comfortable decent amount of leg room. Excellent inflight entertainment with a good library of movies and TV programmes. Staff were very attentive friendly and willing to fetch many glasses of water for my pregnant wife throughout the flight. The reason I can't give EVA 10/10 is the rather low standard of main meal food. It was edible and there was quite a lot of it but it was soggy sweaty and rather tasteless. On the plus side staff regularly brought out soft drinks snacks and fruit. Overall I would highly recommend EVA to anyone flying out to Thailand as a friendly comfortable and best of all cheap airline.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,8,M Baxter,24th February 2011,First time flying to Bangkok from Heathrow with Eva Air (usually go Thai but Eva was cheaper). The planes looked pretty new legroom OK in Economy and I thought the food no better or worse than other economy class offering. The seat-back screens were clear to see but the entertainment options were pretty poor. Eva make a big deal about their memory foam seats but these are the hardest seats I've ever had and made for a really uncomfortable journey! Also if you wait for the cabin crew to bring around drinks you'll be seriously dehydrated. I made sure I bought some water with me on the return journey.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,8,K Wee,17th February 2011,Toronto-Taipei-Singapore return. Check-in fast and efficient. Cabin crew very pleasant and helpful. The slipper pillow and duvet were a nice touch for the flight YYZ-TPE. Entertainment system sufficient with enough movies and CDs to keep one occupied. Food was good and there was no lack of beverages. The plane and washrooms were kept very clean. The seats were not the most comfortable in the sleeping position - one feels as if one is sliding down and had to reposition every so often. I would use them again.,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,4,Louise Grant,27th January 2011,LHR-BKK return. In comparison to other airlines (including Thai Airways) EVA economy class is 2-3 star at best. Temperature control in the cabin is almost non existent constantly shifting from freezing cold to very hot. Staff unhelpful and sullen food is inedible.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1,no
EVA Air customer review,,J Badger,14th January 2011,We were diverted from Heathrow to Cologne on our return flight from Bangkok on 18th December resulting in an unscheduled 3 day stay at Cologne airport. Initially after a 13 hour flight all passengers were held on Cologne runway in the plane for 3 hours without any information on what was happening. Passengers were finally taken off the plane with only hand luggage. Taiwanese passengers were dumped by the airline on Saturday night at arrivals having no visa to get into Germany. It was only until their tour guide contacted the Taiwan Embassy in Germany for intervention were they allowed through into Germany. Not a great start for a Taiwanese owned airline - Red Cross also had to help to provide beds food and drink for these people as the airline would provide nothing. A few hotel rooms were provided on the Saturday night but this was organised by Cologne airport as Eva air did not put any staff in the airport to care for passengers. As there were insufficient rooms passengers were asked to share with people they did not know and some people were left without. On Sunday a representative from Eva air arrived and provided some assistance and a hotel on Sunday night. Sunday evening was the first time in 20 hours that we were given food and drink by the airline. On Monday we were advised our departure time would be 1830. We were then delayed and held at the gate until midnight and then finally allowed to board - at 0100 on Tuesday morning we were advised by the pilot that our departure slot had changed to 0520. By 5:30 running water facility on plane was no longer available creating in sanitary conditions and at for 60 to 90 minutes the air conditioning was turned off leaving passengers to sit in the clothes they had been in for the past 3 days as no access had been made to stowed luggage. It is also important to realise that at this point several passengers who had medication in the hold were becoming ill one requiring paramedics to board the plane as they had not been given access to their luggage since departing from Bangkok or Taipei. Intervention from other passengers appeared to be the only way of helping these people. Finally at 08:40 our plane departed. Would I ever fly with Eva again? It is highly unlikely.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1,no
EVA Air customer review,2,J Lie,2nd January 2011,EWR-CGK in business. Flight schedule was irritating as we had to disembark in Anchorage after 6 hours on the plane (around 6am New York time). I guess everybody was half asleep by that time. Food was terrible - quality and quantity had decline considerable over the years. Service was ok it's hard to understand stewardess that didn't really speak English properly. IFE was below standard selections are just too little especially when compared with CX or SQ. I think this is my last time flying with EVA on this route.,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,1,no
EVA Air customer review,7,K Shaw,30th December 2010,Flew elite class London to Bangkok. Staff friendly seats good - would have paid a lot more with other airlines and maybe only got slightly better food and entertainment.,,,Premium Economy,,,,,,,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,10,Matt Buck,30th December 2010,BKK-TPE-YYZ. I was affected by the closure of Heathrow on December 18th. I waited patiently at check-in at Suvarnabhumi Airport until the crowds had thinned and approached a ground staff member to inquire on the status of my flight. She had originally booked me BKK-TPE-LAX-YVR but did not know I had an additional flight to YWG. Once I explained the situation she rescheduled me on a flight connecting through YYZ. BKK-TPE was in economy class service was very good and efficient. I am glad TPE reopened smoking lounges as it makes transit easier (as an aside for anyone who is wondering). TPE-YYZ flight went smoothly - many empty seats in Elite class and the service was exceptional with water and juice between meals.,,,Premium Economy,,,,,,,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,,Jo-Ann Shore,21st December 2010,Unfortunately we have just become a victim of the Heathrow closures. Our flight was due to leave for Bangkok at 2120 on 18/12/2010. When we got to Heathrow the situation was complete chaos with the EVA Air check-in screens just advising that check-in was suspended pending the arrival of the inbound aircraft. In the meantime the EVA Air check-in staff were 'milling about' behind the counter drinking coffee and taking photos on their respective phones of the sea of human misery which confronted them. At no point did EVA Air staff behind the counter attempt to engage with the airlines customers if only to tell them that at the moment they had nothing to tell them. Eventually (after BAA had announced the closure of Heathrow) the staff decided now would be a good time to give people information. At this time BR068 on 18/12/2010 was classified as delayed. On ringing the number given to us by the check-in staff we were advised that the flight for 18/12/2010 was classified as indefinitely delayed whilst the flight for 19/12/2010 was cancelled. This was then amended to both flights being cancelled. The small concession made by EVA Air was to open their reservations office on the Sunday. However they would only deal with passengers who had booked through Eva; the remainder of passengers had to contact their travel agents which is somewhat difficult on a Sunday. I was able to talk to someone at the Eva Air Ops desk on Sunday and was advised that the airline would do nothing to help. Conversely on desperately trawling through the Web to try and salvage our holiday I noted the following on the Qatar Airways website : Qatar Airways is ensuring that customers due to depart from London Heathrow to Doha on Qatar Airways flights during 18 and 19 December are provided flight options to rebook and depart from the UK on scheduled flights from London Heathrow Terminal 4 during 20 December 2010 offering additional seat capacity as required. I will not be booking with EVA Air ever again. Their complete disdain for the customer experience has (in my view) shamed them beyond reproach.,,,Premium Economy,,,,,,,,1,no
EVA Air customer review,2,J Lie,19th December 2010,I've been flying EVA for the past 5 years mainly EWR/SFO to CGK. The quality is declining pretty rapidly for every year I traveled. They changed the EWR lounge to a smaller lounge in which there is no real food (cup noodles and sandwich was all they have). AVOD is terrible. Service is just okay. Food is absolutely terrible.,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,1,no
EVA Air customer review,2,Alex Zeibel,18th December 2010,"AMS-BKK. Service ok satisfied with their premium class. However very disappointed with the reservation system. My travel agent bought the ticket and I was not aware EVA already assigned terrible seat to me at that moment. I asked the lady at their desk to change the seat for me - it was not possible. Same thing on a way back from Bangkok - logged in 24 hours and not a single seat was shown as available. In the airport they smile in my face and tell me again that not possible to change the seat. We were a couple and EVA ""dumped"" us in the four seats - when I wanted to sit near the window while there was a single guy sitting on 2 seats alone on a flight back. It's totally ridiculous how they assign the seats. Very disappointing experience but EVA don't care about it.",,,Premium Economy,,,,,,,,4,no
EVA Air customer review,4,John Gorry,27th November 2010,LHR-BKK does represent good value however they have an annoying habit of blocking the best premium economy seats so that when you go to choose your seat online only middle seats are left. As an experiment I logged on at midnight last night to choose seats (when the booking window opened) and lo and behold! I rang their Customer Services in Euston to ask them why they did this and I was greeted with a snort of derision. Service is okay - just okay. Consistent in its blandness. As mentioned in other reviews alcohol is not forthcoming maybe they think that Westerners are barbarians who'll lash out if they have two glasses of wine? And the seat makes your legs go numb.,,,Premium Economy,,,,,,,,4,no
EVA Air customer review,8,Richard Berkenstat,25th November 2010,LHR to BKK Business Class. Check-in at Heathrow quick and efficient fast track provided through security. EVA uses the American Airlines Lounge in Terminal 3 which was comfortable clean and many modern computers to use. Food and beverages in this lounge above average. The inflight entertainment was fine and food served pretty acceptable by airline standards. The flight attendants were enthusiastic polite and efficient. Lavatories on Boeing 777-300ER kept clean and stocked. Check-in at Bangkok a bit chaotic and there didn't appear to be a defined Business Class check-in desk. No fast track through security provided. EVA lounge at Bangkok was large quiet and clean food and drinks were good. The Business Class seats are not by any means the most comfortable. Arrival fast track at Heathrow provided and business class luggage came off very quickly.,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,8,Darren Yow,22nd November 2010,Singapore to Taipei return. The meals prepared were right for me. Aircraft clean and seats were neat. The staff were very friendly and safety is very good.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,9,Rob Jones,29th October 2010,LHR-BKK return in Premium Laurel Class. The inflight service and food was excellent entertainment superb. The cabin crew were polite and attentive.,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,5,C Kelly,22nd October 2010,Bangkok-Taipei-Seattle roundtrip - elite class has only two restrooms and due to the configuration only one is easily accessible from each side of the plane. The movies on offer are poor. I have flown EVA for many years and see a decline in quality. My major objection is their insane credit card policy. After booking a flight on line and EVA accepting payment from the credit card company they demand the card be shown at check in. If someone else say a mother paying for a child's trip has the card or you cannot produce it you are denied. You must purchase a ticket for cash or by using another card. What nonsense.,,,Premium Economy,,,,,,,,4,yes
EVA Air customer review,6,T Madsen,22nd October 2010,"Elite class from London to Bangkok. At check-in we were told that handbag allowance was only 7kg which meant we boarded the flight with almost empty trolley bags - never a problem with Ryanair and easyjet with same bags and content. It was American Airlinescheck-in staff with their ""usual charm"". Seats comfortable however a footrest is needed as seat cuts of your blood supply to your legs used our empty trolley bag as foot rest it worked so did come into use after all. Agree with the comments regarding PA's very poor. Food was ok a mix of plastic and ceramic used for food presentation on tray. No drink round just juice on a tray and then straight into the meal service with a wine glass that takes one mouthful to finish off. We were disappointed with Elite Class - it was our first time on EVA Air and had heard good things about their Elite Class. It was not much different to BA's World Traveller Plus where you get a proper drink round first and small bottles of wine with your main meal and more movies.",,,Premium Economy,,,,,,,,4,yes
