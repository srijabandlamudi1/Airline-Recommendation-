"""very courteous, polite and helpful""",9.0,Ronny Adriansyah,2021-02-06,"✅ Trip Verified | We flew ANA flight NH 12 from Tokyo Narita (NRT) to Chicago O'Hare (ORD) on January 13th 2021 as part of trip home to Houston after a SE Asia Family trip. We connected to NH 12 from another ANA flight so after passing security we go directly to our boarding gate. ANA requires all passengers to keep their mask on all the time while in the airplane and while transiting except when eating or drinking. Several ANA gate attendant were making rounds checking people's documents to ensure everybody can legally enter the US. This is better than the UA process of lining everybody up in just one line and clueless on what is the requirement for entry for different countries like we experienced in SFO on our outbound trip. Boarding was announced a few minutes early. Boarding was done in groups; Business Class passengers going first then they start loading Economy from back to the front. They called by rows so there is minimum line formed at the gate, and people can social distancing while lining up. The aircraft was a 14 years old B777-300ER (JA875A) but still in good condition. The flight was quite full but boarding was done quickly. Even with the announcements on cleanings already done on the aircraft cabin, we used Clorox wipes to clean tray tables, seatbelts, armrest and screen when we got to our seat. The seat has fixed back and pivots on the upper section and slides the seat cushion forward for reclining, so there is no risk of person in front of you reclining and intruding into your space. There is footrest under the seat in front of you. Entertainment was OK but for an 11 hour trip like this more choice of movies and TV programs will be appreciated. We used our 3.5"" jack wireless transmitter and bluetooth earphones to avoid cable tangles from the provided earphones. The FAs on this flight were relatively younger than the other ANA flights we flew last few times. They are very courteous, polite and helpful, and they are cheerful when they were doing their job and their positive attitude helps passengers to relax. Rice crackers and wet towelettes were handed out with the first drink service. Afterwards we were served dinner along with another drink cart service. Dinner was either beef sukiyaki or braised seafood. I opted for sukiyaki and it was really good. Later breakfast was served and the choices are salmon flake omelette or pancakes. I chose pancakes and the pancake was good, infused with lots of syrup along with a chicken sausage. Before we land we got a tomato cheese bread snack. we were properly fed during the trip compared to American airliners. In between meals the FAs going around offering water bottles or snacks every couple hours or so. They also set up a snack and drink basket that we can help ourselves at the back galley. There were two teams of FAs and I can see them all working hard and all were very cheerful and helpful to the passengers. They were all so good that I decided to give them a box of chocolate I got from Narita during our transit. They initially refused saying this is too much for them but I told them they deserve it for their good service and to share with the other Team, and they finally obliged. We had to wait for late transferring passengers so we were around 15 minutes behind schedule, but we caught up along the way and arrived at 1.13 pm, 37 minutes early to Chicago O'Hare's Terminal 5. Deplaning was done very orderly, they called by the rows to deplane so there is no line waiting to get off the plane.",Boeing 77W,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Tokyo Narita (NRT) to Chicago O'Hare (ORD),2021-01-01,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,4,yes,Tokyo Narita (NRT),Chicago O'Hare (ORD),ana all nippon airways

Checked in online and was able to secure bulkhead seats. Bag drop counter person worked very quick and professional, and put a priority tag on our luggage. Boarding was done in an orderly fashion, Business Class first, then Economy by row from back to front. The aircraft was a 5 year old B789 (JA875A). The seats were spacious, with footrest and leg rest, and a small tray for holding drink in between the seats, and an individual reading light. Aside from us, there is only one other person in the whole Premium Economy section. The aircraft is clean, but we still use the Clorox wipes to clean the tray table, seatbelts, armrest and the screen when we got to our seat. The tray table and screen in the bulkhead seat is folded into the seat and the touch screen is quite responsive. There is enough movies and TV series to occupy us for this 6.5 hours flight. We left 22 minutes late because we have to wait for some late passengers. But we arrived at 3:13 PM local time, a good 27 minutes ahead of schedule. FAs for this trip were very polite and courteous, and quite helpful and cheerful, a better crew set than the previous ANA flight from Tokyo 2 weeks before. We were given rice crackers, drinks and wet wipes after takeoff, then the breakfast cart start making their rounds. Choices are pancakes and white fish, and I chose the pancake.

"""This is a good flight with ANA""",8.0,Ronny Adriansyah,2021-02-05,"✅ Trip Verified | Flew ANA Tokyo Narita - Jakarta on 31st December 2020 as part of a SE Asia Trip with family. We arrived from SFO on UA and ANA checked all transit passenger documents at their transfer counter before we are given a clearance to proceed to our respective gates. We had time to spare so we stayed at ANA Lounge prior to our departure. Boarding was very orderly and they called passengers by row starting from the back. Most of us have been seated 30 minutes before departure time but had to wait for transfer or late passengers so we were leaving around 15 minutes behind schedule. The plane was an 8 year old 788 (JA805A) but still very clean and in good condition. The seats cushion is fine and here is this net type footrest under the seat in front of you. The load is quite full (perhaps 70-80%) but the flight attendants were able to give out good service. Rice crackers snack, drinks and hand wipes were given after takeoff, and there were two other drink runs afterwards, one with supper and another one with the snack. In between the FAs went around every couple hours to offer bottled water. We got a very good supper (White fish or seafood in red sauce - I chose the seafood and it was good!) and after that a cheese tomato roll snack an hour or so before we arrived. A FA remembers when I asked for sake for dinner but she didn't have it in her cart, and she promptly return with the sake afterwards. However the crew doesn't seem to be the cheerful type. They are courteous and helpful but they are not as friendly as most ANA FAs I met in the past. As usual in a long flight I took a walk to the back of the plane and stretch in front of the restroom near the back galley, and afterwards returning to my seat through the other aisle. When I was passing the galley a FA was asking if I need anything and that I shouldn't be in the back galley area. Well I told her I was on my way back to my seat but since I'm here I'll take a cup of sake and some crackers if she don't mind. It surprises me since in most other long haul flights they always set up a snack basket and beverages in the galleys for people to take themselves and we can always cross the galley when we're walking around. This doesn't seem to be the case - or is it because of this particular route or crew, I don't know. Entertainment works well, and we used our 3.5"" jack wireless transmitter and bluetooth headphones to avoid the cable tangle. Movie selection is not too extensive but enough for this 7+ hours flight. We land in CGK at 11.26 pm or 29 minutes ahead of schedule, and deplaning was done quick and orderly. This is a good flight with ANA but I believe we may have a crew set who were not as enthusiastic or cheerful in providing service, or perhaps due to this flight being a night flight but not a redeye because they all looks kind of tired and reserved.",Boeing 788,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Tokyo Narita to Jakarta,2020-12-01,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4,yes,Tokyo Narita,Jakarta,ana all nippon airways

Although the seat in this flight was not that comfortable (the model is 767); the food & beverages could help you forgotten the uncomfortable feeling of the seats. The food is really amazing; hot enough, taste delicious, and the most important thing Is that after you have your dining finished; the flight attendants will serve you drink Every 15 mins with a different beverages each time; which I have never experienced on other airlines.

As part Filipino and part Japanese, I’m proud to say that the presentation of the safety video is very nostalgic and very cultural, which is what I love! The effort, cleanliness, quality and excellent service of the Japanese food and care from the flight attendants is superior!  The food tastes freshly steamed and cooked with juicy flavors from the main dish, whereas the small side dishes tastes great, plus mini ice cream for dessert! Entertainment was great too. I even like how they even set up a warning about safety concerns for turbulence impact, reminding to wear your seatbelt and PA announcements on the mini TV screen. The cleanliness in the aircraft, the space and comfortably is superb! My only concern is the room space for the leg space for the economy class in the very back seat which is connected to the wall. Either way, the seat itself with the pillows and the blankets are pretty comfortable and clean!  I highly recommend to anyone to look into ANA, their honesty about operating during a pandemic crisis like at this time is strongly recommended to those who are struggling to return to their homes. I would like to say thank you so much again for your hard work and effort and for taking us home safely during this pandemic as it’s tough to work through this crisis.

Despite enduring obvious concerns regarding their industry and their personal careers, the flight staff were friendly, helpful and professional. My admiration and gratitude are overwhelming.

The seats in economy and premium economy had a foot paddle and the seat was comfortable and recline was good. The entertainment was pretty good with lots of new movies like Endgame, Spider-Man, Far from Home and Godzilla. The lounge in Tokyo Haneda welcomes business and Premium Economy passengers which lots of airlines don't do (and only welcome business class passengers) The food was good and the lounge staff were so polite.

"""told I must pay a cancellation fee""",3.0,Justin Colebrissi,2020-01-05,"✅ Trip Verified |  Ho Chi Minh City to Seattle via Tokyo. After we were encouraged to book through their online website by Vietnam staff to save money, we were told by their staff in Vietnam that our infant might be over the weight limit for their child bassinet at the time of flying.  We were told that we should buy another seat for infant to be safe. After checking further their website, I found that the weight restriction for infants in the bassinet is 10 kg. I asked them to refund the tickets, to which they told me I must pay a cancellation fee. I suggested they could refund the ticket with no fee as I booked the ticket only 30 minutes ago. They refused because I booked my ticket on the website I was automatically directed to. I decided to deal with this and hope all would be ok. Finally flight day arrived, and we had no baby bassinet and our seats had been moved from our reserved seats. The agent at the check-in counted was very accommodating and did their best to block a seat for us so that my baby could lay down which was appreciated. Onboard I found the bathrooms ill equipped, my food was average, my seat seemed small, entertainment weak, and supplies seemed lacking for food and childcare. The return flights were worse, not receiving our originally reserved seats, and the staff could not make time to help with our seating arrangement which meant an unhappy babys.

It was a passable chicken dish with side dishes of yoghurt, salad and ice cream. The second meal is a snack and is served within 2 hours of landing. Out of Australia, the snack was fine - something like a ham and cheese croissant, but out of Tokyo the snack was an open sandwich with an inexplicable ton of mayonnaise plus vegetables (corn?), I found it horrible. The entertainment options had some recent hollywood movies to choose from - not much choice apart from that. The TV shows and documentaries were poor or non existent.

My flight was exactly the day after ANA launched its new 777 configuration to JFK, so I got stuck with the old version. However, the cabin was sparkling clean and showed no need for upgrading. My complaint was mainly about obstructed view from the Cube, and lack of storage space providing the size of the suite. Lavatory was underwhelming for first class, especially when comparing to my experience on the new SQ Suites just a week earlier. Catering was excellent, as expected from ANA. I picked the Western menu with a lot of skepticism but then was surprised about how tasty the dishes were. The wagyu steak was indeed overcooked, as anticipated on board a flight, but it was, at the same time, tender, juicy, and flavorful.

"""it's such a good experience""",10.0,J Lim,2019-10-16,"✅ Trip Verified |  Houston to Hong Kong via Tokyo. ANA lives up to its reputation as a 5-Star airline and it is easy to see why. I paid US$825, all-in including taxes, for a round trip journey of 3 legs in each way. HKG-NRT-IAH-LIM & back (United Airlines codeshare IAH-LIM). Incredible pricing. Even from the ground, the check-in process (Haneda) was seamless and it took us a mere 10 minutes for check-in and security and immigration combined. Despite the aircraft (B767 & B777) being of some age, their interiors were retrofitted with up-to-date IFE (with a huge selection of the latest movies, no lagging or dead screens), and USB & laptop charging ports. The widebody aircraft meant that overhead storage space was more than sufficient and nobody had any problems finding space for their bags. The legroom in economy was one of the best we had ever experienced in economy. Recline could be better. (I'm 5""11 or 1.81m and I could stretch my legs out fully), seats were fairly comfortable and I had no problems sleeping 6-7 hours at a go on the 13hr flight and this is in economy. FA service was extremely hospitable. They served 2 meals and a snack over the course of 13 hours. The meals were great and as good as what some average Japanese restaurants would serve. It is also worth noting that the checked baggage arrived with no incident. The only minor gripe, perhaps, is that the 3-4-3 configuration in economy is quite a squeeze. But still, overall, it's hard to complain at such a price point. Even in economy it's such a good experience. They deserve to be consistently at the top of world rankings in all categories.

I explained this to the ground staff at Narita and Haneda multiple times but their response is usually that the reservation system is handled by another department.

First of all, the ANA crew did not know anything about the problem or they knew but they did not tell us, there was no communication between the airline company and customers. All we can do was keep waiting for another delay announcement. A lot of people need to transfer at NRT so the staff let them change the tickets first, that I can totally understand. However, as a business class passenger, I should have the priority to change my flight to other Star Alliance member such as EVA Air, but there was no line for that and after 3 hours waiting in line, one of the staff said the system was closed and my flight cannot be changed. They should just tell us immediately so people did not have to wait for hours. ANA did not arrange a hotel for us, I was flying from JFK to TPE then transfer to NRT, the time I arrived at TPE was 4 am, the time I left TPE was 11 pm, 19 hours of waiting, it was a nightmare. I can assure you I am the passenger who waited for the longest hours. In this case, ANA obvious did not know when the plane can be fixed, they should just arrange a hotel for passengers instead of kept postponing boarding time without explanation.  ANA paid 15,000 yen for communication is barely enough, the taxi from the airport to my hotel was around 10,000 yen, with the tips and tax there’s not much left. At Taipei, food vouchers were not enough, foods were expensive at the airport. 200-300 Taiwanese dollars can’t even get a regular lunch set or dinner set.

Even for a tall European of 1.85m the seat is long enough to find a comfortable sleeping position. Flight attendants are outstandingly friendly and attentive without being obtrusive or robotic, and from my experience they all speak very good English. Food quality was above average, but although the flight from Tokyo to Sydney is 9.5 hours, main meal service comes on one tray with appetizer and entree served at the same time, which I find not really reasonable. I found breakfast on this route rather bland and meagre, but flight attendants are happy to find some add-ons, e.g. a left-over cheese plate or so.

The service is friendly and requests are handled quickly. The washrooms are kept very clean. If I had to list two areas for improvement, it would be the following: The first meal is great.  I think it is delicious and excellent value for economy class. However, it is so good that it makes the second meal inedible. On both flights (YVR-HND, HND-YVR), that sandwich in a box is the biggest disappointment. I would almost prefer it not be served at all. Seriously, the Moroccan chicken on the way to Tokyo was great, but while ANA has upgraded from a white sandwich box to a fancy blue one over the years, that sandwich still looks and tastes like sadness and disappointment.

I took the flight from China to Japan, which only took 2 hours and 10 mins. We delayed due to typhoon but I could see the effort that ANA group staff and cabin staff have put in to make their passengers happy and comfortable. One thing I would point out is that I could feel the difference between the tones of speech from those ANA staff and those airport staff. And that tone will initially make the first impression for passengers. On board the flight, I was warmly welcomed by the cabin crew. ANA’s cabin crew hold a very high standard service requirement and they conduct that to a very detailed and careful level. In general, the meal was one of the best I have had for this short flight and the seat was comfortable, too. The flight was very smooth as well and the flight crew kept the passengers updated quite well. The most outstanding detail I noticed about ANA crew was their cooperation during the flight. Very tiny details such as a smile, a please, a two-hand delivery, a small candy, and a poster card gift for children really made their service outstanding. If I would ask one more thing from ANA, it would probably be SMS flight status messages as they can be very beneficial for passengers especially for those with unexpected delays.

On the Boeing 777 the Business class seats are staggered and there is no one sitting side by side. There is not quite the same level of privacy as in First, but I found the seat quite uncomfortable. First of all, it is rather narrow and I found that I could not place my arms side by side. They had to be on the armrests, even when the seat was reclined, or made completely flat. For this reason, I was not able to do the latter and did not sleep well as a result. The seat was comfortable enough when reclined, but the screen is smaller than in First, and I was at the distance where wearing glasses made no different to the clarity of the film. The food was reasonably good and, since I was returning home, I chose the Japanese menu. However, I did not feel like sampling the meal offered just before landing.

Therefore, they were unable to change my seats and I would sit in middle seats. ANA chose to prioritize their existing customer base over a new customer.

There was more room, the stewardess were young and beautiful and the food was great. They actually had real metal utensils. I had two fabulous meals on the DC to Tokyo and another on the Tokyo to Bangkok. One meal had chicken and another had shrimp. They were served with rice, vegetables, fruit, and even ice cream for dessert. I had to take pictures of them to show people back in the US. You can also check two bags for free. ANA makes money providing this service so why can’t the US carriers. On the return trip from Tokyo to Washington DC I started to take a picture of the meager meal on the US carrier and was rudely snapped at by a stewardess that said I could not take pictures on the airplane.

Had read many glowing reviews and was very excited to fly with such well regarded airline. I was not disappointed. Their air hostesses take customer service to the next level, being professional and very polite. ANA fly a much more convenient route to Tokyo from Sydney than Japan Airlines, going to Haneda airport instead of Narita (Haneda is much closer to the city than Narita). ANA also fly quiet, more new aircraft (Boeing 787-9) than airlines like QANTAS which fly the same route and a similar time with much older aircraft (747). The 787 allows better air regulation in the cabin and can deal with turbulence quite well which helps with sleep in a red-eye flight. It was nice to have a flight where the food tasted really good. Was at restaurant quality which is surprising for airline food. IFE was pretty good, with a decent selection of new movies for all ages, including some of my favourite studio ghibli films. Seat was pretty comfortable with a good amount of leg room for someone who is almost 6 foot in height.

PY to NRT and Business to KUL. Check in at IAD was surreal. I was waiting in line for the ANA counter to open and what a ceremony! The check in staff lines up in front of the check in desk, bowed and wished everyone a good morning in Japanese. Then they silently and graciously got on with their duties. The check-in staff were excellent but the ANA airport manager was really rude and unpleasant when I approached him to ask him a question about the wait for the wheelchair for my mother. That was the only bad experience of the journey. There were many apparent important looking Japanese people travelling on this flight and the ANA staff were bending over backwards to accommodate them at the expense (in my opinion) of other pax. PY passengers had access to the Lufthansa Business class lounge which was simply awful. Only cold food on offer. Boarding was done well and efficiently at IAD airport. Again, service on board was excellent but the food and IFE were disappointing. Mid flight from IAD to NRT, we were served a chicken sandwich which was essentially one slice of bread with a few strands of chicken and mayo. It was not accompanied with any chips or any other snacks which was disappointing for a flight of 13.5 hours. There were two main meals of small portions and again an odd combination of Western/Japanese items. NRT-KUL was in Business class due to the carrier changing the aircraft so we were upgraded to the 787 C class cabin which had a seating configuration of 2-2-2. The beds were angle type and not flat.

KUL-NRT on Y class due to absence of PY on this sector. Top marks for check in staff at KUL, boarding done well and I was travelling with a wheelchair pax and everything was faultless. Cabin attendants were superb, friendly and caring and fussed over my 83 year old mother who was travelling with me. Call bells were answered promptly and always politely. Each disabled pax was assigned a FA when deplaning to ensure that things ran smoothly. The downside, food and entertainment were sub par. They have a funny mixed menu where even if you order a Western meal, you get elements of Japanese food on your tray and vice versa. The IFE was lacking, especially on the long NRT-ORD flight. The Y seats were tight and narrow and would have been uncomfortable for any journey longer than the 7 hours that it took to get to NRT. From NRT-ORD, we had bulkhead window seats, in a 2-4-2 configuration in PY which was okay. There was a leg rest but the drawback was that the screen was mounted on the wall. There was a reasonable amount of recline, seats were wide but you could not stretch your feet out completely. That's okay as it was not designed to be business class. We were given noise cancelling headsets, slippers, ear plugs and other amenities. Deplaning in ORD was fine and thankfully we had a lovely attendant who transported us from terminal 5 to terminal 1 for our UA flight.

However, the legroom was brilliant - I was able to stretch my legs all the way, and I am 6'3"" (192cm). Inflight service consisted of a drink and a small snack. Transfer in Tokyo was smooth and was also where I experienced first-hand how helpful ANA staff really are - I realised I did not have my passport about 5 minutes before the plane was to board, and the staff immediately leapt into action. Two began furiously calling on phones at the gate, and three left to go looking around at all the places I had been in the airport. They even told me that they would delay the flight until it was found! The passport was eventually handed in to the information desk at the airport and one of the staff then went to pick it up and delivered it to me. After this somewhat dramatic start to the second flight, the rest of the journey was smooth, The legroom was again impressive, and the seats were comfortable enough for me to catch a few hours of sleep.

Check in was easy and efficient. ANA allows premium economy passengers to have lounge access. The lounge was comfortable and was a good place to do some planespotting.  About 10 minutes before boarding, attendants came around making sure everyone knew the boarding time. Boarding was quick and easy and we pushed back really fast. Right after take-off, attendants came around with water and rice crackers. About 1 hour later, lunch service started. I ordered a beef and pork dish with cold soba, fruit, and a prosciutto wrap. Portions were very generous and were delicious. After dinner, attendants walked around giving vanilla Haagen Daz ice cream, which was delicious. Soon they dimmed the lights and allowed everyone to sleep. ANA allows premium economy passengers to have one extra dessert or cold soba noodles. I opted for a dessert, which was either a raspberry mouse or some mochi. I got the raspberry mouse, which was even better than the Haagen Daz. I tried to get some sleep, but I couldn't because I kept drinking green tea. Attendants constantly walked around and asked if we wanted water, and then they would give it to us. When the crew turned the lights back on, breakfast service started. I got some chicken with rice Shanghai-style with rice, yogurt, and fruit. This was equally as delicious. Attendants cleared our plates and begin the landing sequence. About an hour before landing, attendants handed out small candies with different flavors.

On the return from HND to GMP, I was sitting causally unbuckled with the cabin door open during boarding.

"""staff still second to none""",7.0,D Wallis,2017-08-02,"✅ Verified Review | I was looking forward to flying with ANA again from Phnom Penh to Chicago via Tokyo Narita, having flown them three years ago and, at that time, was completely overwhelmed with their product. The good news is that some things have not changed - namely their staff. Every ANA employee I encountered was warm, professional, and engaging. In fact, they averted a crisis when, upon getting off the plane in Tokyo, I discovered that I had left my toiletries on the plane. I contacted an ANA employee and within 10 minutes, I had my toiletries back. The flight attendants on all of my flights were top notch and were so kind and caring. Nothing was too much trouble for them. Where things fell short was at the ANA lounge at Narita. On the good side, the shower room was great! But the food at the lounge was very much lacking. I had a 9 hour layover at Narita and got to see the morning and afternoon offerings. While three years ago there was a noodle bar where they made your noodle dishes individually. That is now gone. For the AM, they had four hot dishes: onion soup, miso soup, scrambled eggs, and skillet potatoes. The scrambled eggs had a yellowish color that I had never seen before and looked very unappetizing. The potatoes were left out in the open on a chafing dish. You never knew how long they had been sitting there. In the afternoon, the same dishes were there except that the scrambled eggs were replaced by a noodle dish which, I must admit, was tasty! Again, the potatoes were left uncovered. Sadly, there were times when the noodle dish was left completely empty and not promptly replaced by the staff. The food on the plane, while good, was not awe-inspiring. I had both Japanese and Western dishes and none were remarkable. The only hot breakfast dish on the flight back to Chicago was an omelet. In fact, on all flights there were only three main courses available, two Western and one Japanese. It seems that the food selection on business class has gone down from three years ago.

"""definitely recommend""",10.0,L Wiliams,2017-06-06,"✅ Verified Review | I flew from Vancouver to Tokyo Haneda in Economy Class on June 4, 2017 for my summer vacation. This is my first time visiting Japan and my first time flying with ANA. The seat while being somewhat narrow had ample legroom. There is plenty of open space under each seat which allows you to either place a bag or stretch out if you are tall. The in-flight entertainment was also very up to date, and seeing the movie ""Your Name"" on the in-flight entertainment list was a good surprise. Other good parts of the plane itself are the blue lighting, automated shades, and the washrooms which were clean and not cramped. The use of mirrors inside the washroom really help to alleviate the cramped feeling. Food was well presented for Economy and definitely a step up from what you would expect from a typical North American airline. The selection of free snacks and drinks are much appreciated. Finally, the service was polite, friendly, and responsive. The only thing I can fault ANA for is that the in-flight wifi service was very slow.

Both JAL and ANA helped me to check through my baggage from Jakarta to Mexico City (and from Mexico City to Jakarta a week later) although they don't share baggage arrangement. It was an excellent service from both airlines because I had a long layover in Narita (for over 7 hours) and would like to go to Tokyo for several hours during the layover. I would point out the excellent service from crew of flight NH180 (Narita-Mexico) and NH179 (Mexico Juarez-Narita), especially during meal time. They gave me recommendation on which meal I should choose because I don't eat pork. They even realized that I was (probably) the only passenger who's neither Japanese nor Mexican. One of the crew of NH180 also bid me farewell on my mother tongue. The interior of the aircraft was great and excellent. The crews cleaned the lavatory on a regular basis so it was perfectly clean and comfortable. The inflight entertainment was also good though maybe they can add more western entertainment. I had no problem though because I do enjoy Japanese movie and music. The leg room of the economy class was narrow.

You really get the feeling that ANA staff care about their clients. Food is delicious, great quality of wines, IFE with plenty of choices. The 2x4x3 configuration is the best layout I ever saw on a Boeing 777. Only downside is how the Y seat reclines, instead of your back reclining, it is your hips that slide forwards hence reducing your leg room.

"""HND connection is a winner""",8.0,S Heston,2017-01-13,"✅ Verified Review |  Haneda to New York JFK in late December 2016 with a return on January 4 in Business class. First, from a convenience stand point this flight cannot be beat. It is great to have a Haneda option to JFK available that avoids the 1.5 to 2hr transit from central Tokyo out to Narita where most US flights originate and land. I like ANA's seat configuration and the window seats with the side table on the aisle cannot be beat for privacy. You'll want to check the seat configuration on your specific flight as every other row alternates and other rows have seats where the side table is against the window. This second design exposes you more, but is also fine. Service is generally great, unobtrusive and responsive. Compared to JAL, the HND connection is a winner. Where ANA falls flat I think is food and the IFE system, for non-Japanese speakers. The selection is OK, but nothing great compared to Cathay where has a very large library available on demand. One thing I have noticed on Asian carriers is that the temperature is too high for most westerners. I find overly heated spaces claustrophobic. Dress in layers if you are heat sensitive. I have learned to carry a light cotton polo shirt in my carry on bag that I can slip on if necessary once on board. My complaint is the food. It is sometimes poor, especially the main meal, and this includes both the Japanese and International options. On the upside though is that the a la carte options that may be ordered at any time after the first meal are much better, especially the curry, salad, cheeses, fruit, ramen and other simple dishes. I think with the main meal they try too hard and fail.

The crew were lovely, welcoming and gracious. Meals and drinks were served efficiently and with a genuine friendliness. I chose the Japanese option for dinner and it was pretty good and substantial in quantity. The crew's command of English was fair I would say. IFE on a bright touchscreen that was responsive.

Whether in business or economy, inflight service from their FAs is consistently excellent. Food can be hit or miss but generally of high standards but not quite up to par with what is offered on mainland US flights. My only complaint is that with the Honolulu flight, upon arrival at Tokyo Narita, we are often parked away from the terminal and have to disembark by stairs and then get herded on to buses to be taken to the terminal. This has increasingly become the norm with the Honolulu to Tokyo Narita flight. On my latest flight, I complained to the FA about this as I have arthritis and it is difficult and painful for me to descend stairs with a carry on. She apologized for this and explained that ANA does not have control over gate assignments, but she did offer to assist me with my carry on.

As this is a midnight flight only a very light meal after take off and breakfast before landing are served. So don't expect full courses or appetizers as in other daylight flights. Seats for this business class are 1x2x1 and I would say that seats in A and K sides (windows) are the best in terms of privacy for passengers.

"""cabin staff was excellent""",8.0,S Tallimo,2016-08-30,"✅ Verified Review |  Venice to Tokyo Haneda via Munich. I was impressed that we were able to check-in 2 luggage (23 kg each) plus the hold luggage and I appreciated that the flight departed with admirable punctuality and boarding was quick. Despite the seat was rather small for a 10 hours flight, the plane was new and very clean. Cabin staff was excellent, as well as food and beverages, with a lot of choices. Inflight entertainment: the screen was very good, but movies were a bit old with a very poor choice, especially new movies. All in all I think ANA deserve 5 stars for a lot of things (staff, punctuallity, food, cleaning and services) but the inflight entertainment and seat comfort are not up to the other 5 stars airlines I've tried.

As this was a codeshare flight with UA, and my ticket was under UA, I had to check-in under ANA since this was the first leg of my journey, even though subsequent legs of my journey were under UA. However I was unable to do online check-in, and after a call to the ANA call centre they said their system to process check-in for codeshare flights was down. Eventually had to check-in at the airport, and was allocated a middle seat as there were no window or aisle seats left. Didn't seem like a good start to the journey, though so far interface with customer-facing staff (whether call centre or check-in counter) were positive. On board, the middle seat in the middle row on the 77W actually turned out to be perfectly fine, as there was additional space between the two middle seats. This provided more room than the usual middle seat. The in-flight entertainment worked fine and was decent, but could have a wider variety of offerings. The seat-back was fixed, so when you recline your seat bottom moves out instead. Not very comfortable when you ""recline"", but I was not looking to sleep so I was not too bothered. The food was good (I had the Japanese meal - why not, since I'm flying a Japanese airline), and the service by the flight attendants were fantastic (always with a smile, very polite, and intuitive). I was particularly amused when I was taking photos out of the window on the cabin door in-flight, and a flight attendant offered to take a photo ""of"" me - she actually meant to help me to take a photo of myself, as she thought I might be interested to take a photo. I appreciated her initiative in anticipating customer's needs, despite the initial misunderstanding.

This particular route from Tokyo to Hong Kong is the one I fly most frequently (at least 2 times round trip per month). The seating on board this flight is very comfortable both in Economy and Business Class sections. Business Class has a different layout compared to that of other plans I have been on which is a 5 seat row set up. 2 seats on the outside with a single in the center between the 2 aisles. Staff and crew on this flight are very nice and professional and there is at least 1 or 2 FA's who speak very good English. At Narita and Hong Kong, both flights usually use gates at the far end of the terminals so best to make sure not to be late otherwise you will need to hurry to make the flight.

"""sandwiches with a drink """,7.0,Phillip Musgrave,2016-01-22,"My partner and I purchased a very attractive ANA promotional fare for a flight to Tokyo Haneda from Sydney. We left in December and were fairly impressed with the evening flight to Haneda. However, there was no business class dessert. It was only a 21:30 departure. The IFE was good, the live broadcast of NHK was unavailable in some areas, screen was a great size and the noise cancelling headphones in Premium Economy were fantastic. We were expecting much the same on our return last week. The flight left Haneda just after 22:00, and relatively soon into the flight, the trolley came up the aisle. Assuming it was just pre-dinner drinks, I was ready to put in my request, but everyone was being given sandwiches, with a drink of their choice. I have flown other airlines at night and been served a meal, not just sandwiches.  I was able to request a cup of noodles, but that was pretty much it. The hot meal of the flight was the breakfast, an omelette. So on this leg, there were neither offers of champagne and business class wines or business class dessert. On both sectors, the cabin crew seemed to make themselves relatively scarce. I don't know how many other airlines allow their Premium Economy passengers access to the Lounge, but it would seem that ANA want their Premium Economy passengers to fill up in the lounge, rather than serve meals inflight. In retrospect, ANA perhaps believe that for heatlth reasons a light meal is better after 2200 in the evening, but I would rather a choice be offered than to have a decision made by the airline. The benefits I can see in flying Premium Economy with ANA is that you have lounge access with free food and beverages, the IFE has a larger screen. ANA are not a bad airline by any stretch, but depending what time your flight leaves, Premium Economy is a bit of a take.

In Premium Economy you even have noise cancelling headphones, which is valuable for long haul flights! In addition, for domestic flights, we have a really huge leg space.

The 38 inch seat pitch and 21 seat separate Premium Economy cabin was great and defintely worth paying extra for. The economy section in the rear appeared cramped and claustrophobic. ANA service in premium economy was professional and attentive although the meals (apart from the business class dessert - Haagen Daz ice cream!) are the same as in economy. Whilst the meals (choice of Japanese or Western) were not great drinks and snacks are available free throughout the whole flight. ANA staff at check in both Brussels and Tokyo were courteous, efficient and professional - something other airlines should take note of. If I had any criticism, the three toilets in the rear of the 787 for the whole of the economy section seemed a bit inadequate but the crew kept them perfectly clean and serviceable so no great concern overall. The fact that half the plane is taken by business seats also means there is not alot of room in the rear of the 787 to walk around.

The pre-coordinated wheelchair assistance was readily available. Security was hassle free and no waiting. ANA lounge service is provided by Lufthansa on Concourse B near Gate 50 5 minutes from of departure Gate B41. Lufthansa, in consideration of my wife in a wheel chair, sat us in the Upper Lounge (First Class passengers). Thank you Lufthansa! The lounge atmosphere is bland and uninviting. Not a cozy place to kick back for any period of time and bright sunlight invades the entire lounge. The bill of fare is below United Clubs. Boarding was somewhat hectic but moved quickly once it commenced. Business class was not full. ANA seats business 4 across, in a staggered figuration one on each bulkhead and two in the center. Everyone has aisle access without disturbing his or her seat neighbor. In-flight entertainment was average and offered normal selections. There is a handy power outlet for charging your devices. The seat configuration is excellent with on the deck storage for small items. The tray pullout is world class and I haven’t experienced anything near as useful on any other airline. Seat controls are located on the side and were difficult to operate. I did not find the seat comfortable and the key element missing was the ability to raise my feet and legs, ie. recline. The seat was roomy and I found the seat tracking (forward/reverse) helpful. The cabin was hot for those on the sun side of the aircraft as there is no overhead air outlet.  A free 15 minutes period of wi-fi was provided with additional time available at a reasonable cost. The food was mediocre with small portions. Desert was disappointing and snacks almost non-existing. The cabin crew was excellent and always presented a pleasant demeanor which made the flight all that more enjoyable. Take note also that fellow passengers were dressed either in suit or business casual. No bare feet, legs or other level of undress usually found on American airlines were visible.

Only English language skills of the crew could be improved, sometimes they were difficult to understand. Seats in the Boeing 777-300ER were comfortable with generous seat pitch. But the fixed seats do not recline, they only move forward, so it was difficult to sleep. Meal choices are a bit limited, you've the choice between a Japanese meal and an international meal. If you don't like Japanese food, you have only one option. But quality, taste and quantity of the meals were good (lunch was okay, breakfast was superb). Entertainment was ok, ANA has a huge selection of movies, TV series and music, but most choices were not interesting for me.

Seat pitch is good and better than Singapore Airlines or United, but the width is a tad small. Reclining is acceptable too. Headrest, footrest are standard. Crew is very courteous and I had no issues communicating in English. Flight was delayed at LAX by 1 hour but managed to land on time in Tokyo and Singapore. Food is served hot and the service is pretty fast and meet my needs. As a vegetarian, I requested AVML and was surprised with the quality of food. Full marks here. Entertainment is mostly Hollywood + Japanese and perhaps this is an area they can improve in these days. The movies are not bad either - a dozen plus english movies, couple of Chinese, Indian, French and loads of japanese movies. Overall happy with the journey and I am flying with them next month. Excellent service, quick and attentive crew, on time, great food, In seat power and USB, Excellent/Clean toilets. No ear blasting announcements.

Had a gift for my Mother-In law, and ground staff put a protective cover over it. The bad part of the trip was the United Airlines lounge at Chicago O'Hare. I don't know how United is in the Star Alliance. Alcohol was not free, bowls were styrofoam, with meager food selections, and non working WI-FI. I left the horrific, and dreary lounge early. Boarding was easy, however there was a long line. Boarded nicely, and accidentally went the wrong way. A nice cabin staff corrected me, and escorted me to my seat. Upon settling in, another cabin staff  introduced herself, saying she would be taking care of my section during the flight. Very polite, and professional. Immigration cards were distributed.  I had the the Japanese lunch which was very good. Champagne offered, along with a Chilean wine which I continued to enjoy throughout the flight. Dessert included multiple selections, including Dorayaki with Mocha. It was really good. Cabin staff  made continuous rounds throughout the flight, and never became ghosts. Cabin staff offered to make my bed.  Dining on demand was perfect, as I ordered soup. Watched another movie, and ordered the cheese platter, and Kutsudon, but still could not sleep. I was very comfortable however. Enjoyed the 2nd meal. That is getting kind of old, and ANA needs to do something about that. At least an alternate meal choice, like Singapore Airlines does. Landed 17 minutes ahead of schedule, however an Air China flight had tied up Immigration. Two pieces of Luggage came out reasonably quick, and a speedy trip through customs.

ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,10.0,Keith Murray,2015-07-22,"Best airline service I have ever had. Ever. Wonderful first-class checkin and exclusive security line at Narita. Smart attractive and efficient cabin crew, constant use of customer names (they memorized them from manifest before we boarded), well-maintained cabins, and delicious, plentiful food. High-end spirits and wines, including two choices for champagne, one of which was Krug. Quite simply, it was eleven hours of air travel the way it should be. As one example of the personal service I received, a FA noticed me yawn briefly after dinner and drinks, and in a heartbeat she was at my seat asking if I wanted her to make it into a bed. I told her not right now, thanks, and she said fine – but then when I wasn't looking she came up and made the seat across the aisle (first class wasn't full) into a bed. and a few minutes after that she came by and said there's your bed when you need it. So I went across and used it, put a blanket over me and the seatbelt over that, and went to sleep. I vaguely remember gentle touching while dozing. Come to find out later, when I was asleep she came by, thought the blanket wasn't classy enough and tucked me in with a duvet on top of that.  If I had to pick any nits, it would be the first-class 'suite' ground lounge in Tokyo. No real problems, nice enough food (plus Lindt chocolates which can help everything!), but it didn't match up with Qantas SYD, Cathay Pacific HKG or Lufthansa FRA. And onboard, the the wifi service was usage-based, way overpriced, slow and not user friendly when one reached the quota. I am told, however, that as soon as this month ANA is moving from the usage to a time-based system. Finally, as nice as the ""square suites"" are, in a window suite the wall of the square interferes with a good view. But truly, those are nits.

During online check-in for SIN-ICN, it appeared that there was no way to request for a bulkhead seat, hence we decided to request over the counter. Unfortunately, the bulkhead seat was unavailable, but the gate agent was kind enough to allocate an empty seat, allowing us 3 seats across. Appreciated the gesture very much. She also mentioned that on the return trip from Seoul, a note would be made to the airline to allow for a bulkhead seat. Sadly, during check-in over the counter, it seemed that the request was not processed by the airline and no effort was made to salvage the situation. Instead, the gate agent told us to pay extra for a bulkhead seat which was in the forward economy cabin (there are two economy cabins; forward required payment, back did not require payment). We were shocked to know of such a practice - trying to squeeze every dollar out of passengers, what more passengers who have paid a premium over a low-cost carrier. A complete lack of empathy. No infant seat belt issued on both flights. Limited in-flight entertainment (more like a 3 or 4-star airline standard). New A350 aircraft. On time departure and arrival.

On my return flight I asked again for my pre dinner drink to be served before the meal, which was noted with a smile, but again came with everything on one tray.

The menu was - Western and Korean cuisine. I opted for the Bibimbap meal - a traditional meal of rice with accompaniments and soup, which was absolutely delicious. I am not too keen on sweets, so followed up with a cheeseboard. Later coffee and cognac. The service was unhurried, and well timed serving each course. A couple of hours before landing, a snack was served - actually quite substantial, again the attendants coming around to take your order. Super efficient, polite, yet not chatty or engaging. However, at the end of the flight I was asked if I enjoyed it, which nice little touch. My return flight was equally enjoyable. And in-between meals the flight attendants would come around asking if you wanted anything else such as drinks and snacks including noodle soup. The IFE was very limited, and although the movie selection was tiny, it did have a couple of the latest movies. The touch screen worked well. The Amenity Kit was OK but nothing special. Slippers were provided in pouches. My only slight complain was the actual seat. The controls were very easy to use.

The B777 aircraft is an older version enroute to Seoul. The food is ok, not great as I was expecting. In my opinion they should just serve the Bibimbap enroute to Seoul and something different should be served in between Seoul and Manila and Seoul to LAX. That kind of explains why they have toothbrushes and mouthwash in the lavatories. While on transit in Seoul, the seats in the boarding gates are so stiff. I looked around for better seats to rest and I couldn't find any. The room is also small that there aren't enough seats for everybody. Some passengers just stood and wait for the next flight. Upon boarding, everybody rushed in again without any order. There still is no systematic boarding, unlike China Southern, EVA Airways, Cathay Pacific and Air China. Because of this, I promised myself not to book future flights with Asiana. The B747 for the connecting flight was refreshing as it is wider than the B777 and the seats are more comfortable. It was also quite nostalgic to board a B747.

Had window and aisle seat, large storage compartment next to window. Legroom was just average. Asiana does not offer a premium economy, but charges $100 extra for some bulkhead rows with extra legroom. Service was friendly and efficient. Korean food option was very good. Inflight entertainment was comprehensive with US, Korean and world movie/TV options. ICN to Beijing leg was scheduled to be an A330, but they substituted an A321 that was only half full. Two hour flight departed and arrived on-time. It was uneventful, and was served a breakfast with a choice of western or Chinese food. The return from Shanghai Pudong was on a packed new A350. Seating was 3-3-3 and the first 4 or 5 rows in economy had a couple of extra inches of legroom, for $150 extra. Since it was less than a 2 hour flight I chose not to pay extra. The A350 had seatback entertainment system with a full compliment of movies and TV from both US and Asian sources. We were served a warm lunch, again with western or Asian food choices. We stayed over for 2 nights in Seoul before returning to LA on Asiana flight 204. Check-in at Incheon went very smoothly, using a self check terminal to generate a boarding pass and then dropping our bags. At bag check, the Asiana clerk gave us a pass to use expedited customs clearance. It was very short line, and customs and security took less than 5 minutes. The Seoul to LA leg was again in an A380. This time we sat in the main cabin which is 3-4-3 arrangement. We chose the centre section, so you are only 1 seat away from the aisle. Again, the food options were Korean or western and we chose the Korean option which was very good. I find the Asiana flight attendants to be excellent, friendly and helpful. We ordered wine with dinner, and in a vain attempt to sleep on the flight we asked for a second glass of wine. The flight attendant brought our second glass and several snack packets for both of us.

It is unacceptable that OZ does not allow the Star Alliance airline which has issued the ticket to also issue the connecting boarding pass. A good 20 minutes was wasted sorting this out. Then on to the lounge. Upon entry I thought I was at one of the domestic North American carrier lounges: Crowded, nowhere to sit, no food to speak of, and a line up at the poorly stocked beverage section. At least North American lounges are usually well lit and not dingy dark noisy rooms. Hardly the place I wanted to be after 20 hours in transit. I walked around the ICN terminal until boarding of the flight. Onboard the service was minimal and disorganized. Although a 6 pm flight there was no pre dinner drink service. Instead, there was rushed meal service that lurched to a halt halfway through. After hearing so much about the quality of food, I was rather disappointed, as it was of poor quality. No top up of the wine glass either. The IFE system was nothing to brag about. Uncomfortable seat although the large pillow was appreciated. Overall, Asiana is on par with a US airline international flight which is nothing to be proud of. The quality of service was not good and the value was not there.",A330-300,Solo Leisure,Business Class,ICN to BKK,2016-12-01,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2,no,ICN,BKK,asiana airlines

"""service the intangible that elevates them""",10.0,William Wood,2016-11-22,"Los Angeles to Seoul with Asiana Airlines. I am not a fan of the A380. I have taken a few flights on this airframe and it always seems overcrowded and cramped. That is until I took the Asiana flight. Asiana puts one less seat in each row and overall spreads their business class passengers out more around the cabin to create a much more open feel compared to Lufthansa. I sat on an outside seat which is to say I was in a row of single seats. Asiana's seats are staggered so you and lined up with the table in front of you for extra leg room. Very clever. What they also does is give you a huge table to put your things on. I highly recommend taking a seat with the table on the outside, as this gives you a bit more privacy and allows access to the bins that are under the window. To say this seat has storage is an understatement. The seat is very comfortable in the seated position and in the lay-flat position is easy to get in and out of. My only complaint was that my seat was attached to something on the plane that vibrated, so when you put your head down, you could hear the sounds of the plane. I have had this issue on other flights, so I do not hold it against Asiana. A pair of flush headphones cured the noise. If the configuration is what physically sets Asiana apart, their service is the intangible that elevates them. Asiana excel in service and is one of the best. To me Singapore, ANA and Asiana are the three best. The corps of attendants are always around to help. With most US carriers, the meal is served, chips put in a basket and the staff disappears, but with Asiana mid-flight meals are served with the same attention as the main. I asked for a bag of chips and a tray of options was presented to me. That is service. I would be remiss without mentioning the food. I eat a lot of airline food and with few exceptions, it is not memorable. Asiana food is actually worth waiting for. On all four flights I took with them in the 2 week span, the food was well prepared and excellent. By the last leg of the trip, I was actually looking forward to what Korean delicacy would be served. The other aspect that impressed me was the boarding process. In Frankfurt with Lufthansa boards their A380, it seems like a cattle call with hoards of people trying to board. In Seoul, it is an organized and seemless process and you arrive at your seat relaxed. Nice job! Overall, my experience with Asiana was exemplary. The seats, the service and the food were all outstanding. I will actually take a stop in Korea over my usually direct flight to China to experience Asiana over the US carriers.",A380,Business,Business Class,LAX to ICN,2016-11-01,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4,yes,LAX,ICN,asiana airlines

"""the value was outstanding""",8.0,H Chen,2016-10-24,"✅ Verified Review |  New York JFK to Seoul Incheon. Several prior reviewers helped me pick my business class seat due to configuration of the business class cabin. If you are traveling alone, try to get the 2 seats that have the side table facing the aisles - otherwise you will be sitting very close to someone you don't know (look at seat configuration map of Asiana's A380 business class to see what I'm saying). Try to get the window seat in which the side table faces the aisle for more privacy. The service was polite and courteous. However, if you are used to Western food service style, don't expect the flight attendants to come around repetitively to see if your drinks are filled - you'll have to ring the bell to get refills. I find this to be typical of Asian food service, whether on land or in the air - that staff rarely come around to make sure glasses/cups are refilled. Also, strange that the rolls that came with dinner never had butter served (both on inbound and outbound flights). Seats were great and the blankets were lightly insulated and were quite comfortable. Toiletry kit supplied on inbound (ICN to JFK), but not outbound flight. Excellent wine and liquor selections. AVOD selection of movies was not the most I've seen, but more than adequate. Plenty of music tracks to pick from. Biggest drawback - no WiFi - hopefully Asiana is planning to implement this option soon. Business class lounge in JFK used the Swissair lounge and had only breakfast items were available even though it was 12 noon. Business lounge in ICN better. Check-in, boarding, luggage claim all were quick and efficient.

When I asked for a ""clean blanket"" the FA did not really seem to realize what I meant. Extremely disappointed by these kind of practices. I usually have issues with Asiana regarding dirty windows so I usually ask the FA a wet tissue to clean it. When traveling on a legacy airline, cleanliness is an issue for me, since it's basic respect for passengers. By comparison, I flew Korean Air several times and never had such issues. Take off at 00:40 and ""dinner"" served at 2am. Seriously, the only things passengers want to do at this time is to sleep. FA woke up all the passengers by asking them to put up their seats. Choice was not appropriate - porridge or sea food. I did not take any of them. A breakfast, before arriving at Incheon would have been more suitable.

IFE controller in my seat had several cracks in it, which made it hard to use. The meals and choices of wine of excellent quality. The cabin crew was very attentive, but lacked any personal interaction to make a passenger feel very welcome. No champagne offered as part of the welcome drink, while it was offered on the second flight. Peanuts were served after the meal service, while they should be served before. On the more than 12 hour flight I was not able to observe any of the cabin crew walk through the cabin with water or juices between meals; something which is a must on long flights in order to keep passengers hydrated. One bottle of water was offered after the meal service. After a short nap I asked for a beer to enjoy with my movie. I received my can with a rather cold stare and attitude. Also, no alcoholic beverage was offered during the second service before landing. Not quite a 5-star experience. ICN-SGN significantly better. The cabin crew was very friendly and attentive and made me feel very welcome. Also, no amenity kits on both flights in business class!

Two meals were served, plus a snack and many water and juice runs. The seatback entertainment worked well. My only complaint is about the connection at Seoul Incheon. The connecting time of 1 hour 15 minutes was far too short, as it required going down two long corridors, two escalators, a crowded shuttle train to the other terminal, a very slow security check point and then more escalators and corridors.

Toothbrushes, toothpaste, blankets, headphones and even slippers were distributed to all passengers. A massive range of drinks were available and served very regularly throughout the flight by the kind onboard staff who made sure everybody had something to drink. Asiana sure love their teas as there were many available such as ginseng, green, black and Jasmine tea. I was able to select my seat for free on the Asiana mobile app which was a blessing as I remember having to pay over £10 for seat selection on BA a while back. Lots of legroom and the seat headrests were adjustable. I've previous comments mentioning that the entertainment has been limited on Asiana flights but that was not the case for me as I saw many films that were only in cinemas a couple of months ago with a wide selection of film genres to choose from. Maybe I had witnessed an improvement? The two hour flights between Seoul and Tokyo were of the same quality as the long haul in terms of staff service and meal quality. The meals on all four flights with Asiana were outstanding for economy class. On the long hauls, menus are given out to all passengers with a choice between Korean or Western meals. The Korean meal was definitely the winner when it came to presentation, but the quality of the food for both meals was very high and proper metal cutlery is used. The price of all four flights was well below £1k. I will certainly fly with Asiana again, simply for the amazing service they provide compared to my past long haul experiences with BA and Virgin.

Flight information is presented in a confusing manner. The best part is trying to reserve a seat. Knowing where you will sit prior to arriving at the departure airport is an important part of the travel experience. This is especially true when flying for 12 hours. Evidently, Asiana does not believe this is important and therefore will not allow 50% of ticketed passengers on their flights to reserve a seat. Instead, seat assignment takes place upon arrival at the airport.

"""deterioration of business class food and wine""",7.0,B Stewart,2020-09-25,"✅ Trip Verified |  While there was a direct SYD-SFO option with UA, their price for business class was excessive and my track record with UA in flight service isn't great. So I opted for the indirect SYD-HKG-SFO routing at a much more palatable price that also helped with my oneworld status. The check-in staff in SYD were great and then immigration and security were empty and I was through to airside in no time. Of course, with essentially everything closed at SYD including all the lounges, there was nothing much to do. Boarding was swift and we were on our way to HKG in no time. Security at HKG was also empty however fortunately CX's Wing lounge was open. After the mandatory additional security checks at the gate, boarding for the SFO sector was also swift. I can only say that the Cathay crew on both sectors were outstanding, much like the days of yore when Cathay was one of the world's greatest airlines. Courteous, caring and personable, they seemed to want to go the extra mile to ensure everyone was as comfortable as possible. If this review were just about the inflight crew then they'd get top marks however what drags down the experience is the continued deterioration of the CX business class food and wine offering. Most of what I consumed was average at best although the most surprising thing was that a salad that was listed both as a supper option and then again as an ""anytime"" option, only had one serving loaded for maybe 15 business class passengers. The crew were mortified but could do nothing. I realise things are tough for CX at the moment but why tantalise premium passengers with an extensive menu if you can't deliver on it?

Days after, I received an email that my return flight was changed. Upon closer examination, I realized that CX stuck me with a 24.5 hour layover in HKG. Their attitude was that I accepted the change. I did not. They made the change, not me. I found out that under HK law, I'm not even allowed to have a transit that long! Not sure what CX was planning to do with me after I was denied transit in HKG. When I called, I was offered my previous itinerary on a different date but with a $2200 upcharge.

"""many touch points missed""",1.0,Darryl Manco,2020-02-09,"✅ Trip Verified | Los Angeles to Bangkok via Hong Kong. Travel is a gift. Every touch point should evoke a different sense of excitement and thrill. Air flights are the beginnings of many touch points, and options for comfort exist. International business class is not all equal. Here's my optic of Cathay Pacific Business Class LAX-HKG-BKK and the return BKK-HKG-LAX. How excited we were to by chance be able to save our vacation travel from headaches and fly Cathay Pacific. Originally, we were set to fly PAL Business Class thru Manila to BKK; however, the Taal Volcano threw us a curve ball four days before our journey was to begin. In desperately search for an alternative carrier that would align with existing connections in BKK as well as return accommodation in BKK, Cathay Pacific held the flights. Without hesitation we booked. Now, we are not novices to International Business Class travel. EVA is our most preferred carrier, but its flight schedule did not align with our awaiting connection in BKK. We had always said that we should fly Cathay Pacific to see how it compared. It was only just nine months earlier we flew PAL for the first time and were pleasantly surprised. With that being said, we were under impression that Cathay Pacific held one up on EVA. So, perhaps Cathay Pacific would be our new go to first before EVA. Let us begin. Flight CX881 15 Jan 20 LAX-HKG departed on time. That's always a good thing. The business seat though lacks lumbar support (see photo). The amenity kit was marginally stocked with a toothbrush kit, 15ml mouthwash, Bamford hand cream plus lip balm as well as hydrating face spray, sleep mask, and earplugs. Other marginal amenities were a pair of small disposal slippers that are not quite sized to accommodate a wide foot market and a comforter. No pajamas here folks on this long haul as EVA, but to be fair PAL lacks PJs as well. Good thing though I brought a heavy cotton sweater as the cabin is kept cold, like cold cold. You learn these little things as you travel. Not all carriers maintain comfortable air. Movie selection at first appears to be vast, but upon further review, Maleficent was the only recent movie. I'm not on top of trending movies, so I named Maleficent due to TV commercial exposure. The rest are older releases with some that are ancient. Ah, not something expected. Please take time to learn what customers are seeing at the movies. A note about the interactive monitor, it is sluggish to the point of freezing up at times while scrolling. What type of dated software operating system is being used? Just saying. The dinner options were typical. Local food with some Western. When the flight attendant came to take my dinner order, she asked if I would like the burger. She then asked if I would like the seared chicken breast. That received a no. She actually looks stunned and finally asked what I would like. I ordered fish ball tung choy choy soup. For beverages, I ordered French Burgundy and water. BTW, no flight attendant comes around asking if you would like more wine.  Dessert taken was cheese along with fruit, and I asked for a cordial Cointreau. Another look of like OMG I have to work. With the flight leaving almost at midnight, there was no pre cordial anything which was not expected either. So many touch points missed. Remember this is International Business Class, not American/United/Delta domestic make believe first. A tablecloth is laid, but do not get excited.",Boeing 777-300ER,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Los Angeles to Bangkok via Hong Kong,2020-01-01,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,Los Angeles,Bangkok ,cathay pacific airways

Having flown ANA, JAL and other Asian airlines, we decided to give Cathay's business class product a try as we had heard good things about them. Our first impression from the onset was lack of hospitality from the check in counters which gradually got worse as we boarded. The onboard FA's never welcomed us properly, didn't ask for our coats to be hung. The Flight manager came once introducing herself and we never saw her again. The crew were just pacing up and down the aisle and never once smiled. They continued with one of the worst meal offerings. The meals on a set menu weren't dine anytime options, they were pre packaged and felt the same offerings were being presented to economy class passengers. The bread tasted like it was transported from 4 flights before. It wasn't surprising to see how much Cathay had declined in the reviews. Currently, they sit at the bottom among 10 best airlines in some websites and much lower in others. It's sad to see that a premier airlines can't get the basics right. Perhaps, the can take a leaf from ANA and Singapore airlines hospitality. We flew Singapore economy on short haul flights and their service was next to superb with so much attention to details in economy! The positives at Cathay were their beds and on board IFE. The beds were very comfy with the duvets and offered good privacy. However, the cabin cleanliness wasn't great. The 777 aircraft was tired looking. The Pier lounge at HKG was great at first impression especially their tea and bar offerings. However, the lounge fell completely flat in food options. ANA and JAL lounges in Japan are absolutely amazing compared to Cathay's.

Other than the meal service no beverages were offered. There are no air ducts above each seat so you are unable to adjust for comfort. The Vancouver to Hong Kong leg was almost unbearable. The Hong Kong to Perth leg was so so hot and nothing can be done about it. On return I booked bulkhead seats at extra cost but arrived to find that seats were at least 2 inches narrower.

"""really disappointed with the overall experience""",6.0,Nicole Wright,2020-01-21,"✅ Trip Verified | Brisbane to London Heathrow via Hong Kong with Cathay Pacific Airways. Considering the premium seats cost almost 4 times the economy seats, I was really disappointed with the overall experience. Meal was exactly the same as what you receive in economy, as is the amenity kit. When compared to PE in Qantas or BA, this lacks a lot (you get meals and drink service more in line with business class on those carriers). The only advantage if you are a OneWorld Emerald or Sapphire is getting access to the Pier Lounge at Hong Kong Airport, otherwise if you don't have status and are looking for an upgrade other than just some extra leg room then I wouldn't recommend this. WIFI also didn't work on all 4 return legs of my flight, despite there being a WIFI symbol on the walls. You would be better off spending your money on China Southern Airlines business class seat for a similar cost (and get a lie flat seat) or paying for economy on one leg & business on the other (with any airline).

Cathay fly to places one actually needs to get to, in my case, Zurich. All flights on-time or very early. All food options good. Quality service from a very attentive cabin crew on all flights. As a One World Emerald member I had access to the superb Qantas First Lounge in Melbourne and, of course, various Cathay First Class Lounge offerings in Hong Kong. Cathay also uses the Aspire First Lounge in Zurich and this is quite superb.

"""revamped First is disappointing""",5.0,L Yee,2019-12-05,"✅ Trip Verified |  Hong Kong to London. Check in was a breeze at the City Centre in Hong Kong, and staff was friendly. The lounges were the highlight, with massage, private day room, and the Cabana was beautiful with its own bath and daybed. The lounge food was satisfactory. However in comparison with Lufthansa first class terminal, the food was pretty subpar. There was no private transfer of course from the lounge to the plane either. For the flight itself, there was no accompaniment to the seat, just a 'turn right' by the purser. Both flight attendants were polite, friendly, and helpful, but no going the extra mile. I was greeted by the latest upgrade of the inflight amenities that Cathay highlighted in their latest 'Let your senses guide you' campaign: The seat itself is the same with its spaciousness and is extremely comfortable.  The new Bamford kit is nice, and the new bedding is comfortable, but no more than before. The pillow is too large, but the red small cushion is soft and a pleasant addition. The welcome drink is downgraded from champagne to a small glass of comparatively cheap Jing tea! Then came the meal itself: the same caviar with champagne that was not well chilled, lobster main course sounded great on the menu but came out exceedingly bland and tasteless. No cheese was offered voluntarily by the staff. The dessert of passion fruit pie was sickeningly sweet and disgusting. After dinner, chocolate was given out but then retrieved as I slept so I had to ask again afterwards. All in all a very disappointing dinner. That is in line with my last meal with Cathay in Business, which was inedible. The flight overall was very bland, and nothing special, unlike the First in Lufthansa or Swiss, which was classy and luxurious.

Departure and arrival were on time. At the boarding gate, passengers were subject to additional security screening.

The aircraft from Manchester to Hong Kong was modern and new. The seat was comfortable and equipped with personal in-flight entertainment screen. The IFE contained large options of films, TV shows and Music. The seat itself was comfortable and adjustable with headrest. The seat provided a pillow and a blanket with headphones. The seat pocket contains everything that every long-haul airline standard have (magazine, safety card, sickness bag, shopping magazine etc). The crew handed out a menu which is very useful for making meal options. The flight departed on time from Manchester and lunch service was provided an hour after took off. The food was delicious and of a high standard. The crew were really friendly and motivated. They constantly providing refreshments for passengers for a whole flight. This is an overnight flight so the cabin lights dimmed very early. The dimmed was through out the flight until the breakfast service around 3 hours before landing. The toilet was modern, clean and have good facilities. The breakfast service was fast and like lunch service, the food was delicious The flight arrived on time in Hong Kong. The first flight is really impressive long-haul flight. The transfer process in Hong Kong is easy and fast. I took my second flight to Phnom Phen with Cathay Dragon. The seat is really comfortable and the aircraft equipped with air vents. The onboard service is good with a complimentary drink and mid-flight snack, but the crew weren't really friendly and didn't hand out all papers to hand into Cambodian immigration.

The seat was comfortable but I was surprised by the lack of storage space at sitting level. There was a small storage box at the bottom of the seat and one by the armrest, which I didn't dare use for fear of leaving stuff behind. The flight left on time and we had options of a quick supper or a full meal. I opted for the former and was served a rack of lamb which was beautifully cooked. The accompanying vegetables were overcooked and I was surprised that service comes on a tray instead of being brought out course by course. There was also no dine on demand but there were snack options available throughout the flight. There was no mattress for the seat so that was a minus for me. Otherwise, the pillows were adequate and there was a duvet which I didn't use as I found the cabin too warm. The IFE was good and responsive and we were given good quality headsets.

There was breakfast before landing which again was served on a tray and there was no spoon provided to stir my coffee!

Which was not a bad experience after all, and it was my own fault in the first place as I had not booked business class in advance. Fortunately at ZRH airport, upgrades could be made directly at the gate. The food was very good in both classes, however there was the additional option of ordering food at any time in business class, which was a nice perk, but haven't really taken advantage of because the lunch, dinner and breakfast was more than sufficient to satisfy my hunger.

Premium Economy on Cathay Pacific does not allow lounge access. Boarding process was a mess. They announced boarding was about to start and pax were lining up but then delayed boarding for at least 45 minutes citing security issues. In the meantime, I was questioned by a young security staff asking me silly questions about my trip. He was rude and repetitive and cold hardly speak English. When we finally boarded, the flight was delayed and only left the gate about 50 minutes after departure time. On board, the PE seats are a fail in my opinion as they are definitely not 20 inches wide and appear no different to an economy seat in terms of width. I have flown Premium Economy on the Cathay Pacific 777-300 and although they are older type seats, they are wider. The seat pitch is good as is the recline but when the passenger in front has their seat reclined, it gets very tight. The leg rest is a bonus and as I was in a window seat, the seat is jammed right against the window leaving no space to store blankets etc. The IFE was good and very responsive. The screens are large and crisp and there are additional storage spaces below the IFE screen. The seat pocket is very low down and limited in what it can hold. Basically storage is a problem. The food is the same as economy, small portions but I ordered a kosher meal which was delicious and plentiful.

BA lounge is much better and lounge staff extremely polite and helpful. Flights on time. Service levels by FAs among the best in the skies. Food and drinks are deteriorating and has absolutely no business glamour: only 3 juices offered, only 2 cheap industrial beers (Carlsberg and San Miguel), no smoothies, no blue cheese.

Service and product is consistent. However for a premium economy passenger (I often fly their business class and find it underwhelming) I think other Asian airlines do a much better job. The seat is comfortable but very dated. On my return journey the economy class cabin had received a make over - with more seats squeezed in but also new IFE installed. Premium economy meanwhile still had the old IFE and old deco. I also found Cathay Pacific entertainment very limited. Catering onboard was not good. I always eat in the lounge when I fly with CX and skip meals onboard. Even their business class meal is not up to standard let along Premium Economy offerings. I also found service deteriorating. Most of the crew were robotic and just about to manage their tasks. Also depends on your luck. On some of the 777 premium economy you have to go to economy class to use the toilets.

Next CX flight to DXB kicked off only 10 hours later and made me lose my onward tickets (2 legs).

"""something has recently gone very wrong""",4.0,J Henden,2019-06-22,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Hong Kong. I have been flying this long haul route for some years, and often with Cathay, in fact this sector recently as well. I’ve never posted a review and never had cause for complaint before now. But something has recently gone very wrong with this previous exceptional airline. On boarding, even though I was on early, I wasn’t offered a drink and the staff seemed manically busy. But that’s not a biggie. After takeoff, the usual polite approach about meal choices - and this is where it all went wrong. The choices where limited (OK, it happens) and pretty dreadful. The ‘express’ option was either a vegetarian salad (OK, I’ll live with that as well) or soup (soup??). That’s it. So now I’m pressed for what I’m going to have for brunch (brunch? Where did brunch come from? Wasn’t mentioned on the last three same sectors I’ve done). I can’t describe the options as other than the omelette the words were unknown to me - I investigated further and found one that was fried turnips with some sort of porridge on top. No thanks, so I gave up. By the way, later on I was told that first class had cereals and croissants and toast - are you kidding me? So back to ‘dinner’. The vegetarian choice was a warm salad which sounded ok - and by the way, still haven’t been offered a drink which would have been nice. The ‘meal’ arrived with half a glass of red wine (which was good - disappeared quickly though), and wait for it. It was a sort of salad although you couldn’t see it as it as an orange foul smelling hot sauce had been poured on it. Disgusting. I politely handed it back, gave up and asked for the cheese. That appeared a little later - three water crackers, three grapes and two tiny wedges of cheese. Two and a half hours now passed - asked for a top up of wine. It never came, so I gave up, put my tray on the floor, drank some water and went to sleep. Six hours later, tried to get a tea, told the seat belt light was on and they couldn’t. Ok, I get that, but believe me, there was zero turbulence that anyone could possibly feel and the crew had disappeared. Got my fried turnips (sans porridge) and water at “brunch”, then when the bumps increased, off came the seat belt sign and I got a cup of tea and the chief of cabin crew got me a small croissant from first class! No, I’m not a whinger, yes, I understand safety and I know an airline when it’s losing the plot - sorry Cathay but I worked with you some years ago, have flown this route countless times, but we have choices now, and that was a shocker. What ever genius found your ‘chef’ and threw away the up and down the aisle service (forget the ipads - they take ages for the crew to work them out), get rid of him or her and go back to what you were doing less than 12 months ago - it worked.",Boeing 777,Business,Business Class,London to Hong Kong,2019-06-01,4.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,3,no,London,Hong Kong,cathay pacific airways

"""I would fly them again""",7.0,Marc Pinol,2019-06-06,"Not Verified |  Barcelona to Hong Kong. This was my first time flying with Cathay Pacific. I had very high expectations of such airline; they were met but only to a certain extent. I did my check in using its app; it was fine, I have seen smoother apps, but good overall. Bag drop and boarding in Barcelona was very easy - they even gave fast track access to go through security as it was really crowded and I had 60 minutes. The flight was fully booked, but the 3x3x3 configuration of the a350 is a big plus as it does not feel that crowded. Seats very comfortable, with a massive touch screen, foldable support for phones and tablets, USB charger and an incredibly convenient cup holder. Also, decent leg room. However, in my own opinion, IFE was sort of limited. Two of the major disappointments were service and food. Yet and by all means, they were not bad! Service was correct and very attentive, but I never get that vibe that makes you feel extra special. In regards to food, it was also ""just"" correct - not different to more average airlines. I have to say it was fantastic that you can order hot noodle cups at any point as a snack. I am not 100% sure if that was the A350, but I dealt with jet lag better after that flight. The cabin was at a very convenient temperature, air was not very dry (and I feel it instantaneously as I am using contact lenses). Overall, a very good flight with no complaints.

"""found the food and service ok""",5.0,T James,2019-05-15,"✅ Trip Verified | I used to fly Cathay Pacific Business between Europe and Asia (and was disappointed with the service) but had to fly Premium Economy this time due to the high price during holiday season. Overall I think it represents better value than business class. Check in at London Heathrow was fully automatic - you have to print out the boarding pass, luggage tag and attached it to your bag and drop it using a machine. Not an issue here. Boarding was smooth and easy and we took off on time. Hot towel and welcome drink were provided. I was able to secure the first row of the cabin and found the leg room much better than other seats in PE. However the screen is stored below the arm rest so if you plan to watch a lot of movie or have gate to gate entertainment this is the row to avoid. The A350 used for Hong Kong to Taipei sector is far superior than the B777 for long haul. I found the food and service ok - given the fact that it was sub standard in business class. One thing I don't appreciate is unlike EVA which I often fly with, the toilets were not regularly cleaned. I also found the selection of movies poor. When I booked my Premium Economy ticket I was inform that the flight from Hong Kong to Taipei would be operated by A330 without PE so I was allocated a seat in economy. When I arrived at the gate I spotted that it was changed to A350 with PE and check with the ground staff if it is possible to get a seat in PE.

Cabin staff overall was average bordering on robotic save for one exceptional hostess, I still gave it a 2 as on the return leg, menus for dinner/breakfast was not distributed and incoming passenger cards were only provided upon request (!)

"""satisfied with my experience""",7.0,M Martin,2019-05-04,"✅ Trip Verified | This was my first time flying Cathay so I cannot compare it to its previous glory days. Overall I was satisfied with my experience. Cathay is comparable to the other better airlines out there, though none of them are particularly great these days. I liked that I could check in 48 hours in advance and take 2 suitcases with an economy fare, which is better than most airlines. Having to enter my advance passenger information 4 times (once for each flight there and back) was ridiculous, however. Boarding was well set up, with separate lines clearly signposted for each class of passenger. This prevents massive scrums to board. On both flights (B777 and A350), legroom was good, seat recline was excellent, and IFE was very good with large selection of entertainment and high quality screens. Cabin service was efficient if rather robotic and cold. Meals were pretty decent, especially the Asian dishes. I particularly liked the curry fried fish with rice and the noodles with dumplings. On my return, the flight from Perth was delayed by 2 hours. I received good advance notification via email and text message about this, so I could leave 2 hours later to the airport. Fortunately the delay worked out well for me, as it reduced my stopover in Hong Kong from 9 to 7 hours! I have two major criticisms, both regarding the 15-hour flight between Toronto and Hong Kong: 1) The new 10-abreast seating on the B777 is awful (apparently Cathay used to have 9-abreast seating until recently). The seats are very narrow and the armrests stick-thin. For 15 hours you are constantly being elbowed, knocked and brushed by your neighbour as well as people walking down the aisle if you have an aisle seat. I have a very slender and narrow build, so I cannot imagine how passengers with broad shoulders or who are overweight can tolerate this seating. Sadly, virtually all airlines now have this 10-abreast seating on their B777s, so passengers may have little alternative but to suffer. The FAA should not have allowed this layout, especially for super-longhaul flights like this. 2) There were only 2 meals served on this very long flight: one after takeoff and one before landing. No meal service for 12 hours in-between!! ""Snacks"" were available in the galley throughout the flight, but they were minuscule (literally bite-size) and unhealthy. There really should have been a third meal or proper snack box served mid-flight. I'm not sure if this is standard among other airlines for super-longhaul flights, but it's woefully inadequate. Despite these two criticisms, and with alternative airlines not really being better overall, I would choose to fly Cathay again.","Boeing 777-300, A350-900",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Toronto to Perth via Hong Kong,2019-04-01,3.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5,yes,Toronto,Perth ,cathay pacific airways
"""just another ok airline""",5.0,David Gerber,2019-05-01,"✅ Trip Verified | Sydney to Phuket via Hong Kong. As others have said in recent times, I don’t believe Cathay deserve their 5-star rating anymore. I have a long history of flying Cathay, going back to 1979, on one of their final B707 flights into SYD. This trip was very, very ordinary to say the least. Firstly, I chose the flights I did, so as not to fly with their 10-abreast B777ERs. So, all 4 sectors were flown with A330s, 2 with mainline, 2 with Dragon. Much more comfortable. I found the cabin crews were still excellent. The problems come from what they are given to work with and offer passengers. Just off the top of my head, in addition to the race-to-the-bottom that are the 10-across B777 configurations, in the past 10 months since my last trip, the following have gone from Y-class service: amenity kits, refresher towels before takeoff, juice or water prior to take off, deserts on the meal trays (the ice creams which are now the dessert, had always been an “extra”). Until now, I’d go out of my way to fly with CX. No longer. I’ll use them if it makes geographical sense to do so, like Aust - Europe and that, mainly due to the Marco Polo club benefits. But no longer, say, for Aust - N.America, as I quite often gladly did in the past. All very sad!

They have removed all the fresh flowers from the cabin and keep the toiletries in the lavatory to minimum. They also don't provide pajama and slippers to the passenger. I am not too bother about PJ but slippers should be the basic essential - most other airlines even offer that in economy. Secondly, I like the design of the new menu as it's more interesting and casual but the execution is badly done. Presentation of food was not great and food didn't taste nice at all. It feels like a economy class food placed on a better plate. Wine menu is also not impressive as they serve simply the cheapest supermarket wine. Service in the long haul flights was definitely short of expectation. Very minimal interaction with the passengers even in the day flight, and the service was very robotic with smile. For the night flight the service was non existing. Choice of movies is always very limited unless if you fancy Hong Kong movies. It is very strange as the service in short haul flight was slightly better. Overall if you can get a good price with CX and/or access to one of their flagship lounges then it's not a bad option; otherwise there are so many better Asian/European airlines that provide better service and software for the business class.",A350 / Boeing 777,Solo Leisure,Business Class,London to Taipei via Hong Kong,2019-01-01,5.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4,no,London,Taipei ,cathay pacific airways

So this corresponds to their request. Entering the cabin, the inflight manager could not answer the approximate arrival time - needed to repeat the same question and insisted the answer before take-off for communication reasons.

The food presentation was excellent and far better than the old style food brought on the trolley. I liked the idea you could choose one of the mid flight snacks as lighter meal instead of the main meal. The only thing I didn't like was that the cheese course was now an alternative to the dessert rather than before it being a course in itself. So you could only have one or the other rather than both. The IFE software has been upgraded to the new style system seen on the A350, which I love. However the hardware is still old and found the screen resolution not great and unable to cope at times with the higher resolution films with blocky pictures. One other thing that needs to change is the awful fragrance (or lack of) on the hot towels - please, please Cathay address this!

"""kept up their good service on-board""",9.0,Peter Comeau,2019-03-09,"✅ Trip Verified | I've been flying Cathay Pacific London to Hong Kong and back for nearly ten years now. Here's why. I started off flying Virgin because I'd already accumulated air miles with them and the price was right. However I soon found out that their airline staff are overworked and tired, food was mediocre and, worst of all, I still couldn't acquire enough points to get into the Business Lounge despite frequent flying. A quick calculation showed that if I joined Marco Polo club I'd go Silver after a few flights and I would get to book extra legroom seats free of charge with the advantage of extra luggage allowance plus being able to check in and queue for the flight using Business Class. No brainer then! Over nearly a decade Cathay have kept up their good service on-board. It seems like the airline staff can't do enough for you, including serving snacks and noodles and drinks throughout the flight. Meals are good (and much better when they upgrade me to Premium Economy or Business which happens when the flight is full), the entertainment system is excellent and the extra legroom seat option is a bonus. Having said that, relatively recent changes to the seating has resulted in less padded seats with a recline method that is uncomfortable, making it difficult to sleep, so deduct a star for that.

"""I cannot recommend Cathay""",2.0,H Reade,2019-02-26,"✅ Trip Verified |  Bangkok to San Francisco via Hong Kong. I am normally impressed with the service and family-friendliness of airlines in Asia (compared with US airlines), however, we had a terrible experience traveling with a child on Cathay Pacific. When I booked my flight, I confirmed on the phone with Cathay that we could use our car seat in the aircraft (we purchased a separate seat/ticket for our almost 2-yr-old). On our first flight, they would not let us bring the car seat onto the plane, even just to try and see if it would fit. The new B777 configuration has narrow seats in a 3-4-3 layout. On our long haul flight from Hong Kong to San Francisco, I had to really persuade the staff to even let us bring the car seat on. They argued and kept saying that it probably would not fit. Of course, it fit just fine on the A350 and with our active toddler was essential in enabling him to sleep on the 12-hour flight. Ground staff members were remarkably rude and unhelpful (again, very non-typical for Asia-based airlines, which generally have friendly service). Our first flight was delayed two hours, so we called the airline and switched to an earlier flight. We rushed to airport to make it on time, only to sit on the plane in the engineering bay for almost three hours as they worked on an engine issue. The crew did very little to make this experience more enjoyable (water, snacks, perhaps?). Our carry-ons were well under the maximum allowable, and yet since our toddler can't carry his own, it was a struggle to haul things into the plane. We asked if the staff could help and they snipped back at us - you have to be able to manage all of your luggage. (Yes, I understand that, but our two-year-old, who has his own seat/ticket and luggage, cannot carry his own. Also, we have to carry him, so that limits what we can carry). Can we make exceptions for families with young children and help them out a little? I cannot recommend Cathay to any families with young children.

Boarding was orderly and departure on time. The A350 is truly a modern aircraft, it's noticeably quieter and up to date technologies available throughout the aircraft such as wifi, touch screen TV etc. The PE sets are laid out in 2x4x2, and is relatively more spacious with ample leg room and good seat pitch. In terms of hardware, CX did very well this time. Software wise (food and service), it was rather mediocre. Crew did not look welcoming, nor happy to be there. It was streets behind their competitor on this same route Singapore airlines. For PE, we are served economy class meal, portion are noticeably smaller than many years ago, plastic cutlery, no salt, pepper sachet and toothpicks provided, it's by request only, all scream to me big cost-cutting. Presentation, portion and taste of food was rather bland, at least we were offered a cup of Hagen Diaz ice cream to finish off the meal. The load was very full, crew were efficient to go through their duties, but there's no charm or smile at all. The good old days when flying with CX was an amazing experience was truly long gone.

I should also point out that passengers on this flight to the U.S. are not pre-cleared by US immigration and customs unlike other flights.

The main thing that stood out for me was just how cold and rude the cabin crew were. All service was robotic.

Later in the flight the same crew member could be heard mumbling after a passenger asked for water in the middle of the flight. Part of the problem here is that the crew made zero drinks runs during the 13 hour flight apart from those served with the meals. Obviously this will increase the number of passenger requests for drinks.

On the Hong Kong - Jakarta flight (4 hours 30 flight, so no shortage of time for a single meal service) the crew were in such a hurry to get the meal service done that they were not offering the passengers a meal choice.

Separately and for the first time we were bumped off a longstanding confirmed mid morning departure (no explanation) Sydney to London into a much earlier flight which caused us ongoing difficulties. Also don't expect much at Gatwick Airport Departures because there is next to nothing by way of assistance. To add insult to injury the airline has recently changed the Economy Reservations process where you now have to pay for a more expensive ticket to continue to reserve your seat with them which represents a sizeable fare increase for many clients and something their cheaper direct rivals simply dont do. They say that you can wait up until 48 hours before departure to apply for a seat on the lower fare but most if not all flights are fully booked well ahead these days so thats just word games for people wanting certainty and anyone who travels knows it.

"""gluten free food was disgusting""",3.0,Dennis Griffin,2019-01-18,"✅ Trip Verified | Tired planes, food not great - gluten free food was disgusting. Travelled with my wife from Auckland to London return, so 4 business class flights in total for each of us. The Boeing 777 planes were old, tired and uncomfortable, however on the last leg we had an A350 which was much better. Inflight entertainment was poor, the amount of recent films was quite limited. Staff were friendly and efficient. Food for me was not bad, however on one leg the prawns were still frozen. For my wife who is gluten free the food was very limited and quite disgusting. Gluten free gets no choice of food even in business class. One meal was boiled fish, which was overcooked and had no seasoning, often starters were just plain salads and dessert was just ice cream. The worst one was a breakfast which was baked beans, tomatoe and spinach. It seems like gluten free is considered an afterthought on this airline. Even the staff agreed that it was not very good, and that they get many many complaints from gluten free passengers. They asked us to complain as they said the airline did not listen to feedback from staff, only from customers. As such apart from this review we will also make an official complaint. The crazy thing is that this airline is Hong Kong based. Having visited Hong Kong many times we know that Hong Kong has some of the best gluten free food options in the world.

I have travelled Cathay before, and had issues on the food they serve, but never with the crew onboard. This is the first time, and I was very surprised with their behavior. On the flight from BLR to HKG, the air-hostess asked me my meal preference, and when I asked what they served ( a menu card was not provided), she simply moved on to the next passenger. I had to ask her again, and she sighed and showed me something scribbled on a piece of paper. On the flight from HKG to SFO, I had a bad cough and needed hot water, and the seat belt sign was on, so could not walk up to them. When I pressed on the crew button, they would turn it off and not respond. I had to press the button couple more times before someone came by. Finally a air-hostess showed up with her hands folded and a stern look, and before asking me what I needed, instructed me to turn off the light. I did and asked her politely if I could get some hot water, she said it will take some time. I said that's fine, and she sighed and walked away. I was not sure if I would get it or not. After about 20 min, she got me the water. After that I did not ask for water again. Later during the flight, I pressed on the button again to get some cup-noodles (could not walk up as the seat belt sign was on). Again the same experience, the air-hostess ordered me to turn off the light and told me that it will take 15 min to get the noodles and told me not to press the button again. I am a very patient person, and always give people benefit of doubt before jumping to conclusion (a person may be having a bad day), but this was too much to handle! Will I fly Cathay again?

"""one of the most comfortable""",7.0,S Klass,2018-12-14,"✅ Trip Verified |  Newark to Singapore via Hong Kong. I fly CX every year on this trek back to Singapore from NJ and its very consistent. Boarding at Newark delayed by an hour due to a baggage issue but we did land right on time in HKG. The cabin crew were upbeat, warm and welcoming. They were pleasant, smiling and working efficiently throughout the flight. The meal service seemed slow but maybe had more to do with not having enough crew onboard to work such a large economy cabin. The meals onboard were the biggest disappointment. Portions seemed even smaller than before and the quality of both meals was certainly not up to par. Rice was dry and clumpy and the beef with it, overdone and lacked enough sauce. No salt and pepper sachets either. There is virtually no difference between the meals served on the long haul to the shorter medium haul sector to Singapore. The saving grace was the midflight snack bar that I stumbled on when I ventured to the back and to the opposite aisle. Good selection and better quality than the meals themselves, sadly. The seat on the A350 is probably one of the most comfortable, barring the seat back issue - which has been brought up here. Good cushioning, back support and legroom. The IFE screen was sharp, responsive and the selection a tad disappointing with insufficient newer films and I feel a better way to filter or sort the films available according to genre etc, would make selection easier. I loved the Tail and belly cams and the Moving Map was great. The toilets onboard seemed to be showing a surprising amount of wear for a 2 year old plane and the sinks in the 3 toilets I used, didn't drain properly with water remaining for a while.

For the sake of clarity, because we flew several times with Cathay Pacific, I became a member of the Marco Polo club, silver member now. This loyalty is apparently one-sided because at home I filed a complaint and received an automated message that one of the employees of the Customer Relations Department would contact me within 10 days. This has not yet happened, not even to mention that the complaint handling takes longer, nothing. I think this is a shameful way to deal with your customers.

"""roughly the same as it’s competitors""",7.0,A Wong,2018-10-31,"✅ Trip Verified | Despite Cathay Pacific being more expensive than Air Canada (on average), I opted for Cathay Pacific on the grounds that they had the midnight flight to Vancouver - this ultimately means that I am able to maximize the amount of time that I have at my destination.

They have more attentive flight attendants and better IFE choices, but that’s about it. The food is okay, but I feel that Air Canada has better food, and despite having wider seats than the former, I still find that Air Canada seats and the cabin as a whole feel more comfy (maybe it’s all the mood lighting). CX888 still operates the 777-300ER exclusively, and while I love 777s, Cathay decided against installing wifi on them. I do applaud Cathay’s commitment to cabin cleanliness - I don’t get any nasty surprises by taking my shoes of or putting my bag on the floor, and they do provide plenty of bathrooms for people. To date, Cathay is still the only airline where I can walk over to the galley and get whatever unhealthy snacks and beverages I want without anyone raising an eyebrow, so that’s nice too, but otherwise if you have some time to spend, and you are operating on a tight budget, the Cathay experience is no longer a distinguishing feature for the airline.

Being a Marco Polo green member, I took advantage of the fast track lane to board. Anold B777-300 with hard shell seating for this flight. Flight crew are not as friendly as other flight I had flown with CX. I was surprise when I took a photo of the cabin, the flight purser approached me that photo is not allowed in the cabin. Hot meal is not available on this flight. The cabin crew were seen rushing with the distribution of paper pack which contains savoury pastry, cookies and a pack of ice lemon tea.

"""outstanding inflight service""",10.0,G Jones,2018-10-09,"✅ Trip Verified | Manila to Hong Kong. Quick short visit to Hong Kong. Flying with Cathay Pacific's brand new Airbus A350-900 on this route (CX918). Checkin in at Manila Internation Airport Terminal 3 was quick and efficient. Out of all airlines flying to and from Manila, Cathay Pacific has the most efficient ground service and handling despite its multiple flights in and out of Manila. Cathay Pacific has recently opened their brand new lounge at the new-ish terminal a few years ago. It had every component that the lounge offers at their Hong Kong lounges minus the showers. Food selection was great as was drinks. Boarding was quick and efficient, doors were closed on time and left the gate on time. Upon boarding, the first thing I noticed was the brand new plane smell and the flight attendant's warmth and friendliness. The seats were brand new, cabin was very clean and very spacious. As soon as I sat down on my seat, I immediately noticed how wide the seats were and how generous the leg room was. The IFE was also their new Stuio CX which offered live TV and Wi-Fi connectivity. Only being a two hour flight, the crew swung into action giving snack bags which contained a biscuit, juice box and a pastry - which to me personally is more than enough for a very short flight despite what others moan and whinge about in here comparing CX's meal service to Philippine Airlines who serve full meal. I personally am not a binge eater and couldn't careless about whether an airline serves a full meal in economy class or not. The snack bag was delicious and more than enough for the entire duration of the flight. After the meal services, the cabin crew again came offering second rounds of drinks. They were all very friendly, warm and chatty. Overall, despite what others have said and complained about Cathay Pacific's service going downhill, having flown with them over 13 times over the last 18 months, I find their service to be outstanding and highly consistent living up to their reputation of being a 5* premium airline. Over the last year, I have flown with other 5* airlines - Qatar Airways and Singapore Airlines and both do not even come close to the service Cathay Pacific offers. Overall, if I had the opportunity to swith loyalties from British Airways Executive Club to Cathay Pacific Marco Polo Club, I will in a heart beat but the downside is the difficulty of gaining oneworld status with Cathay Pacific. As oneworld sapphire, I get the same service their own frequent flyer gets which to me is more than enough.

They have a very good time schedule from Bangkok to New York. As I arrived at the airport in Bangkok, I was notified my flight was going to be 1.5 hours late. This would make a tight connection in Hong Kong (less than an hour). I requested a change to an earlier flight which they happily accommodated - very good service! The staff on both flights were great, friendly, well trained, personalized service. The food was very good. IFE had a wide selection with good quality noise cancelling headphones. Both flights were on 777's. The regional flight BKK/HKG was the old model business class 2x2x2 with angled seats - comfortable enough for a 2.5 hr flight. The second leg, HKG/JFK (almost 16 hours) was on the new 777 long range version of business class 1x2x1. All individual pods, all with direct aisle access. The pods are on par with the best in the industry, lots of storage space, comfortable lie flat bed, large television screen, both electrical and USB outlets for charging, Ipad & iPhone USB interface to the television screen so you can watch your own programs on the big screen, good quality comforter.

"""cabin staff always welcoming""
",8.0,Geoff Herbert,2018-08-30,"Not Verified |  Gatwick to Melbourne via Hong Kong. Pleased with Gatwick on lunchtime departure. Just check for South Terminal at F Gate, Nice casual boarding [unlike the demeaning line up and wait at Hong Kong]. Cabin staff always welcoming and helpful. Every seat taken - seems a Cathay method. Typically a polite crowd to travel with, majority Chinese, a few Australians and British. I had a low calorie meal on order, so got served maybe 30 minutes ahead of others and by personal delivery. Out of Gatwick the main was delicious fish - very good even if no choice and no menu. Captain message as usual on this airline was English name and well spoken. I rate this airline for having British pilots - gives me confidence in basic skills and also the ability to communicate clearly in the event of difficulties. I told myself the A350 has been in service on this route for over a year, and is used intensively, flying into Gatwick after 11 hours from HK and ready to return at lunchtime. The Cathay themed seats in aqua green are starting to look tired, as also the furniture in the toilets [Try liifting the lid and some stain on the rim]. I require several breaks from sitting as I rarely get to sleep. So I found a small space near the aft toilet where I could pass 30 minutes doing easy knee and toe exercises without being hassled by the crew. [This used to be easier on the 747 with its extra space]. The allocation of toilets was just ok, I counted five located midway and aft. The nice thing about the A350 is that it is not carrying huge numbers, easier to manage. The meals are only average, lacking some extras such as hand towel and block of real cheese. Wine [red or white] comes in a plastic glass - gone is the mini bottle. On boarding, there is no welcome juice or hot towel. The seats feel spacious but are short on supportive cushioning. I actually bolster the seat with the blanket and pillow to support low spine and thighs. The choice of movies is good but falls short of the Qatar Airways range. I enjoy checking the route out over Lowestoft and north to Denmark and the baltic states before an amazing great circle route over Russia through to China. I enjoy the live video cams showing take off and landing. Fortunately daytime on transit in Hong Kong Airport [It is depressingly closed there on night time transits] found a western style breakfast cafe. But kept wishing it was Singapore with its fantastic restaurants. From there Cathay lost points by transferring us to a tired looking B777ER and lining us up like cheap people for 30 minutes before boarding. They could do this much better. Deperture 30 minutes late was not made up. On attempted touch down in Melbourne [shown on video] the pilot aborted landing at the last moment and took off for another attempt. He blamed cross winds for this but I suspect the speed and decline were out of sync. Arrived 4 minutes late turning 11.05 pm. Just one thing to remember, on arrival at Gatwick the Cathay gate is very remote and there are no airport toilets for that sudden need, for maybe 20 minutes hard walking. Impression, love the airline its helpful crew and the route but will have to compare Qatar on price and miss the comfort of Singapore Airport.

As soon as the seatbelt sign was off, the cabin crew started the drinks service, given a bag of peanuts and full sized can drinks which is more than sufficient compared to other airlines. Main meal service portion was great, Movenpick Ice Cream handed out and the cabin crew again offered us drinks. The food served on CX is the best I have had on a long haul flight. The cabin crew came along with trays of drink every hour and a self service drinks and snack 'bar' was set up in the galley with plenty of options. Cup noodles were offered half way through the flight with another drinks service. Breakfast was served prior to landing which again is the best I have had on a long haul flight - I chose the chinese option which was amazing. Overall, Cathay Pacific truly deserves its 5 star rating from Skytrax. Nothing went wrong on this flight and I personally don't think Cathay Pacific has a lot to improve on - perhaps Wi-Fi on the plane and upgraded IFE which is already on the way. The cabin crew were very friendly, polite and professional, ensuring lavatories were kept clean, offering drinks and responding to passenger needs promptly.",Boeing 777-300ER,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London to Hong Kong,2018-05-01,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5,yes,London,Hong Kong,cathay pacific airways

I've been flying with Cathay Pacific ever since they started offering non-stop flights to Zurich (2015) and have experienced their economy, premium economy and business classes. The seats are comfortable I like the new A350. That's it. If you're tall, you won't like the business class seats as the space for the foot area narrows significantly. The business class food is also subpar compared to other airlines. The food in all classes is not good in general. Further, the variety of (good) movie options went down significantly. There are barely any new movies and more of classics, the ones you have most likely seen already. Check out the June 2018 options if you can. Ferdinand is probably your best choice. What's the absolute worst, though, is the arrogance and unfriendliness of staff that I've experienced on numerous occasions, particularly of the floor staff.

I chose CRK as I would not want to trouble myself getting out of MNL Airport. Last time I flew CX was in 2009 to RUH. The service and food then was great so I trusted that it would be the same or better. Flight date is 08 June. Check in was brief, pleasant. Felt at home as there were a lot Filipino staff in EWR. Airplane is new, legroom was good. In flight entertainment was great! This is a 15+ hour flight and we had 2 meals and snacks in between. I had dinner around 8 PM. We flew out 1:55 AM. Most of the restaurants near the gates were closed and besides food the airport was expensive. After supper (which was very good. I had beef, fried rice and veggies) I was still hungry. The menu said that they offer cup noodles upon request. The FA gave me another entree! As really am not able to sleep during flights, I walk around. I went to the galley at the back of the plane and they have snacks. Few hours passed, I went to the back and asked for toothbrush. I noticed that they do not provided amenity kits unless you asked. I asked for socks at the beginning of the flight. I think I asked both of these from the team lead FA. She is not smiling, very serious and does not even respond back after saying thank you. I had a feeling that she does not like serving Filipinos because she was from Hong Kong. There was an Indian flight attendant serving my area and I thought it was nice for CX to have diversity in their crew. But I was really disappointed the way this team lead FA treated me. I have read a few reviews and it feels very tight. I guess I have gotten used to western airlines that offer small chats. So snack time came and they were serving cup noodles. I am hungry so I requested for one. The FA was apologetic and told me I can only have one and I did have mine already. But other people are not even having a snack. They served breakfast late.30 mins before landing they are still serving breakfast. Overall I did not enjoy this leg of the flight. Transferred to Satellite terminal in HK. It was packed flight.

What a terrible waste of money it was spending just under 1925 GBP to travel Premium Economy with Cathay Pacific. I will never fly with them again. I booked and paid in May 2017 for a Premium Economy flight to Sydney.  I was flying out to Australia on 26th September 2017 and returning 25th April 2018. At 73 years of age and travelling alone, I thought that I would treat myself and incur the extra expense of being able to book my seats in advance. However when my date for return to the UK came around I was shocked to find when using online check-in the day before travel that my previously booked window seat on the 9.5 hour leg from Sydney to Hong Kong had been allocated to somebody else. I had been bumped to an aisle seat at the back of the cabin and just a couple of feet from the economy class cabin. I queried this at Sydney airport on my departure day. They were unwilling to do anything about it. I asked the lady in my previously booked seat, how she got it. She had booked 9 months after me and was not related to the person sitting next to her, so it was obviously a Cathay malfunction. At no stage did I receive any notification of the seat change. I complained to Cathay Pacific and eventually got the promise of 100USD compensation. Still waiting. That is under 4% of the ticket price. This was a terrible experience and I will not be risking a repeat of it.

"""been my best ever flight""",10.0,Tony Spitale,2018-05-01,"✅ Trip Verified |  Including the two-hour refueling-stop in Vancouver - where passengers from JFK have to stay on board - the flight from New York to Hong Kong ranks among the world's longest flights.

For someone who is looking for as much rest as possible this is certainly a good option. On the first leg to Vancouver I skipped dinner because I felt sleepy. Soon after take-off my bed was prepared and I only woke up 30 minutes before landing into Vancouver. I was served the requested cake from the dinner menu and had a quick cup of tea. The best entertainment on board for me was actually watching the ground-staff cleaning, re-catering and preparing the aircraft during the stop in Vancouver for the flight to Hong Kong. Soon after take-off I slept for another five hours. Foodwise I was impressed by the fact that some offerings were freshly prepared such as jasmine rice, toast and scrambled eggs. Dining on-demand is a plus when one tries to overcome jetlag. I was able to start with breakfast instead of dinner options and finish off with dinner options before the early morning landing.

The 350 is a great aircraft, and it took me less than 5 minutes on board to figure out that I wanted my next trans pacific flight on one of these-they're quiet, spacious, and high tech. From the reclining seats that slide forward to make life easier on those behind you to the headrests which seemingly defy the laws of physics (they fold in-and out) the attention to detail is superb. The tray tables have a tablet stand, and the personal space in general had more functions than I could figure out. Cathay service onboard really doesn't need another glowing review-it was superb as expected. Meals were excellent and served promptly, trays were also collected promptly as well after the meal. The inflight entertainment is really top notch, though the screen is a bit jumpy as you scroll through. For those of us with terrible hearing, the volume is adequate without being turned up too high-it helps that the plane is very quiet at cruise altitude.

"""focus on details was truly amazing""",8.0,W Pearce,2018-02-27,"✅ Trip Verified | Flew Bangkok to Toronto via Hong Kong. Bangkok Check-In was smooth and professional. Staff informed me of a possible seat upgrade and asked for my seat preference if upgraded. Cathay's lounge in Bangkok was fairly chaotic, as a British Airways flight was delayed and hence resulted in a higher volume of number of people. Bangkok to Hong Kong on a 3-class A330-300. The flight was full and quick, flying time was 2 hrs 9 minutes instead of usual 2 hrs 30-45 minutes. Crew were mostly Thai and were extremely pleasant over meal service, showing Thai hospitality and Cathay's core value. Otherwise, flight was uneventful and the plane arrived Hong Kong earlier than scheduled. I had booked an itinerary that would require an overnight layover in Hong Kong. Heading to the lounge, the staff was welcoming and informed me the lounge would close at 12.30am. I visited 3 lounges and I found the Pier to be the most suitable for a nap as there is a nap area. I returned to the lounge at 5.30am, when it reopened, prior to my flight to Toronto. Hong Kong to Toronto on CX828. Once again a full flight in Economy and I was upgraded to Premium Economy for the flight. Seat next to me was empty. Amenity kits, headphones, a blanket and a pillow was placed at the seat prior to boarding. Seat provided extra legroom that would normally be found on bulkhead Economy seats. The seat storage was adequate and the focus on details was truly amazing. Tray table was easy to operate and was of a good size to fit a laptop. Flight departed Hong Kong slightly late but arrived Toronto half an hour ahead of schedule. The crew on this flight were pleasant, offering several round of drinks throughout the flight. However, despite all the positives, the biggest let down on this trip was catering. Especially on the Premium Economy sector, I chose the western option for lunch and the mashed potatoes were soggy and grainy. Dinner was standard, but for the most part, meal was similar to that of Economy's. Although the plus is getting actual metal cutlery instead of plastic ones. Overall, an average experience.

The seat in design terms is pretty much the same as the old product, which is a great, why change something if it ain't broke, but obviously with a better resolution screen, updated handset, and a couple more storage holes. However, my only gripe about the A350 is that the headphone sockets now only takes a 2 pin adaptor of which strangely one is 2.5mm and the other 3.5mm. Hence my Bose QC35 no longer work - first world problems right? Cathay or Airbus please work with Bose to sort this out!

"""new premium economy was superb""",10.0,D Robinson,2018-02-26,"✅ Trip Verified | I have always flown Cathay (B777) from London Heathrow, mainly because of Cathay's superb lounge in T3. However this time I thought I'd try out Cathay's Premium Economy Class on their A350-900 from London Gatwick. While at Gatwick's South terminal and being a One World Sapphire member I got to use BA's lounge and the First Class lounge at that! To be honest I was really disappointed and not a patch on even Cathay's business lounge at Heathrow. Moving onto the flight. The new premium economy was superb! The new darker colour scheme made the seat feel cosier, modern and sleek. The seat was comfy, in fact it was the first time I've actually had a proper sleep on a premium economy seat. The noise levels are definitely lower than the B777 and certainly noticed my skin and throat didn't feel dry with the new air filteration system. The updated IFE with a wider screen than the B777 is probably one of the best on any airline and, in my opinion, far better than compared to Emirates. It was easier to navigate through and just worked (a month before, I took a return Emirates A380 flight from LGW to Dubai and on both legs the IFE stopped working!). My main gripe with the new A350 is that the headphone sockets now only take a 2 pin adaptor where one pin is 2.5mm and the other 3.5mm - hence my Bose QC35's adaptor no longer fits which was really annoying. I even enquired with Bose to see if they had a suitable adaptor which they didn't - so really bummed about that - if Cathay can provide a suitable adaptor I'd be really happy! I really shouldn't complain about the food on Cathay anymore after sampling the awful food on Emirates. Staff were, as you'd expect from Cathay, to be professional and courteous.

When I board the aircraft, the crew has already been so annoyed by people moving around that they used a relatively unfriendly tone asking passengers to get settled down. Fortunately, their attitude improved after departure. The inflight food has a god taste, and the cup noodles provided between meals is hot enough. However as this a 16-hour flight, the crew provided a second meal at the middle of the flight, in the addition that many passengers have consumed their cup noodles before the second meal. This results in a poorer feedback of inflight food. The airline should consider providing a lighter meal or snacks at the middle of the flight. The inflight entertainment is ordinary.

The real star of this show was the A350. The aircraft was new, quieter than the 777 and the Cathay seats in economy were very comfortable.

Boarding in Bangkok was chaotic, since the gate was poorly laid out, not the airline's fault. Seat: Though mildly comfortable, it wouldn't have been the best for my back if the flight was any longer than what it was (2 hrs 6 minutes). Padding was relatively rough and seat storage was limited. However, the positive side is that no one would recline into you. Hong Kong to Toronto on an older 777-300ER. Seats were standard of Cathay's long haul and made the 14-hour flight bearable and comfortable. Catering on both flights improved since my last trip, with the ice cream actually edible when handed out. The meals themselves were of adequate portions and tasted standard. Cabin crew were extremely pleasant on both flights, going out of their way to accommodate requests despite the turbulence both flights encountered along the way.

Although PE is advertised as having a dedicated check in, at T3 LHR the bag drop is shared with Economy and there was a 15 minute queue. Boarding went smoothly with PE prioritised after First and Business, and the lower density of seating meant there was plenty of space in the overhead lockers. Seats were comfortable and, as someone who is 6’4” tall, I was delighted to be able to stretch out. Seat recline for sleeping was also good, although when the seats in front of us were fully reclined, it was quite difficult to get out. Amenity kit had all the basics but nothing special. Cathay’s in flight entertainment system had a good selection of films etc, the screen was a decent size and I appreciated the noise cancelling headphones.

Check in was professional but had to ask at reception if someone was available to take our orders for breakfast at the fantastic restaurant in First Class Lounge. Food was just ok. Boarding was professional. Then everything went downhill. Indifferent crew and dreadful food. One option of starter with a salad but no dressing was served with it. Rice with main was very hard. Crew did not offer to top up drinks or offered more bread. I asked for a mid flight snack and the noodle was still hard so asked for rhe burger which was actually very good. Breakfast option was also excellent but I was not offered coffee or hot drinks and for some reason I was ignored by cabin member who served people around me. The cabin service director, who after I complained about the robotic, unprofessional and indifferent service, came to see if all was ok, was horrified I was ignored.

"""bit skeptical about Cathay""",9.0,A Walpes,2017-12-28,"✅ Trip Verified |  Hong Kong to Paris CDG. I am a little bit skeptical about Cathay. It is clearly a top airline and perhaps their CDG-HKG-CDG route is not highly strategic. HKG airport lounge first class lounge is far away from boarding gate. No announcement was made of the flight delay, and as you are not escorted to the plane (this service is standard procedure for some airlines) you end up waiting before a closed boarding gate! Luckily there was a closer Business class lounge (named the bridge I think), which proved perhaps more comfortable than the First class one. I decided to have them wait for me and didn’t move until they called my name (I was naughty but it was very late). The seat is extremely comfortable. Once transformed into your bed, it is very large.  A special mention for the pyjama. Flight attendants were very nice. The night ambiance of the plane was standard and I missed the privacy of Air France curtains or Singapore airline sliding doors.

"""mediocre economy flight""",4.0,E Draviti,2017-12-26,"✅ Trip Verified |  Hong Kong to Milan. A mediocre economy flight. The seat was pretty comfortable as CX standard even if my charging port was not working and the entertainment selection good. On the other hand the meal was the worst part of the flight. The menus were distributed, but only one to be shared each 3 passengers (saving on paper?). Food was boring looking and not in a great quantity. Bread not very well heated. What is worst is that they serve filtered water from jars. Breakfast of congee or eggs with sausage. I believe that CX catering is most boring and predictable. Service was efficient but very cold. Next time I would consider flying with EK or QR.

"""service and style has deteriorated""",6.0,B Wilkinson,2017-12-15,"✅ Trip Verified | My first experiences with Cathay Pacific were in economy more than 10 years ago on flights from YVR to Bangkok and NYC. They were such excellent experiences that they became the Holy Grail for good service. However I didn't travel to the Far East again until recently. We booked Premium Economy expecting our previous service to be surpassed. I would still recommend Cathay based on reliability and the competence and courtesy of all their ground and air crews. However the space and meals in Premium Economy left a lot to be desired. I realize that a lot has changed in 10 years but recent Premium Economy experiences on Lufthansa, Air Canada and BA to Europe were much better. The food was awful particularly on the HKG to YVR leg. The menu promised a selection of several wines but only two were on hand and the white was warm. The food was wretched and I'm not one to complain. It was overcooked, cheaply made, unimaginative and served in awkward plastic containers. Absolutely nothing premium about it and if economy is worse then something is amiss with their customer service strategy. I wonder if inconsistency is a problem because we could only book economy of their flight to Hanoi where we were surprised to be served a meal at all and it was better than the ones on the long haul premium flights. The seats were not roomy and the look and feel of the cabin was grubby. The hard-working and pleasant crew spent an unusual amount of time flogging their Duty Free products which made us feel like we were on EasyJet at times. In short, service and style has deteriorated from past experiences.

I realize that preparing food in the air presents particular challenges, but I don't know why airlines serve overcooked and underseasoned dishes. My main gripe with Cathay is with the ground service, which is non-existent. The First lounges are hard to find and not worth the trouble as the service and food are limited and worse than in business. For goodness sake: Even at the home airport of Hong Kong, there was no help with finding how to transit or to find the lounge.

Cathay Pacific did not have a good style of boarding, rather than boarding economy from back to front to avoid congestion, all of economy was called at once and boarding took way too long and there was too much isle congestion. The cabin crew were not friendly or helpful at all, on most airlines I've flown the cabin crew greet you and direct you to your seat, on Cathay you get on, nothing happens and you find your own way, the crew just stood there talking. The seats were comfortable although the seat pockets on the seats were directly connected with fabric and no internal plastic, meaning whenever you or somebody else went into the seat pocket, the person in front felt it quite a lot and it was frustrating while trying to sleep. The meal options werent great, considering it was a flight from England to Asia, you'd expect there to be British style options as well as Asian, not on this flight. On dinner service the crew were rude, ""what do you want"" I understand their first language is not english, but being a flight from an English speaking country you'd expect there to be a little better knowledge. I noticed most people had bread rolls, I didn't get one so I asked for one, the attendant thought I was trying to get two and explained it was only one per passenger, I told her that I hadn't been given one and she didn't believe me.

IFE was excellent on the A350 not so clear on the 777-300. The only disappoint for me is the food presentation and quality - its not that flash and could be better.

"""Seat was very spacious""",8.0,W Pearce,2017-09-01,"✅ Verified Review |  Vancouver to Bangkok via Hong Kong on Canada Day. Flight from Vancouver was delayed 2 hours due to the late departure of the aircraft from its origin (New York-JFK). Ground staff in Vancouver assured me I would have time to make the connection in Hong Kong due to the shorter flight time than usual (12.25hrs on the YVR-HKG sector compared to the usual 13.00+ hrs). I was skeptical due to my past experiences with this particular itinerary. I had no choice but to keep my old connecting flight. As a Marco Polo Club Silver Member, I was entitled to use the First and Business Class lounge in Vancouver. The YVR lounge is definitely superior to some in Hong Kong due to less crowds and quality staff. The serenity and assuring gestures from the lounge staff calmed me down and depleted my anxiety about my connecting flight. Flight to Hong Kong on a Boeing 777. Seat was very spacious with several storage compartments even in Economy Class. Inflight meals were standard as per Cathay's long haul service and cabin crew worked hard to meet every need to passengers. Arrived Hong Kong an hour later than initially scheduled, only to find out my original connection was delayed by 2 hours. Although slightly devastated, I was relieved as I no longer had to run to make the flight. The Bridge lounge in Hong Kong had adequate space and serenity for me to relax and rest prior to my connecting flight. Cathay Pacific has excelled with their lounges, whether it be the space or amenities/facilities. Flight to Bangkok boarded on time with the new departure time but took almost an hour to obtain clearance from Air Traffic Control due to the busy period at Hong Kong Airport. Ultimately, flight departed Hong Kong 3 hours late and arrived Bangkok almost 4 hours late due to congestion at Bangkok Airport, resulting in a holding of almost 30 minutes. I was upgraded to Premium Economy for the Airbus A350 flight and the seat seemed a bit tighter than the ones found on the 777s, yet the amenities and more updated IFE made up for the flaws of the seat. Service was essentially the same as Economy for the short haul and crew were great throughout.

"""certainly far from the worst""",8.0,H Shandak,2017-08-11,"✅ Verified Review |  Mumbai to San Francisco via Hong Kong in economy and when possible I prefer Cathay Pacific primarily because Hong Kong is probably one of the best connecting airports. The airport is well designed, security checks are fast and reasonable. And if you have a long connection, there is a free visa on arrival, which lets you explore Hong Kong city. On occasion, I book a 12 H transit halt so I can relax in HK for a bit. While the service and amenities aren't the best, especially when compared to airlines like Emirates, it isn't the worst either. The food is fairly good. They carry one Asian, one Western and one veggie (usually pasta) entree. The dessert is almost always haagen-dazs vanilla ice-cream with a mini-chocolate bar. (Although once I did get Mövenpick) As a frequent traveler on the airline - it does get boring to get the same dessert and same choices. You can almost start predicting the menu after a bit.  If you are a whiskey person they have Chivas Regal 12 on their carts.  They also have a specially developed beer, designed to taste great in a pressurized cabin, called Betsy. Named after Cathay's first airplane - the beer is actually pretty good. The entertainment system is good. They have a very good selection of the latest English and Chinese movies, TV shows and TED talks. I find their short film section to be particularly interesting. I usually listen to classical music on long flights - and in this department their selection excels. There is usually a selection of newspapers like the New York Times and The South China Morning Post apart from leading newspapers in Mandarin just before you board. Their in-flight magazine Discovery makes for a very engaging read.  The online booking and web check-in interface is very dated, and occasionally buggy. The interface of their frequent flier program isn't the best either, but on the plus side, they do ship a physical card to your postal address - which is a nice touch. I hope they improve their technology soon. A big sore-point for me personally is the lack on Wifi on the A330 and B777 fleet. The newer planes (A350) supposedly have Wifi - however I have never personally been on those flights.

I wanted to experience Cathay's new A350 in Business Class, so traveled Bangkok to Sydney via Singapore to take advantage of low business class fares on  daily flights from BKK to SIN flown by A350s.  What a beautiful experience, both hardware and software. Hot towel and drinks (including champagne) offered after seating. Even though just a 2-hour flight, a full lunch service including steak and two other options for main course, and started with drinks (excellent selection of wines, including a well selected Marlborough Sav Blanc). Seats are herringbone lie-flats in a 1-2-1 row with lots of room and storage spaces, a large flat screen offers a wide range of entertainment options that can be viewed from the minute you sit down - and during takeoff and landing. The seat's design has excellent privacy features, so if you are in one of the center seats, you don't have to see the other center seat occupant, and all seats are shielded from aisle traffic and views of seats from across the aisle. the lavs at the front are large, windowed and perfectly placed (not at the very front which would require navigating through the galley and resting crew members). The A350 features on-board WiFi though didn't use it. The cabin felt roomier and more quiet than other wide-bodys in CX's fleet. The crew were both professional and friendly - very attentive but not overly so. I've flown 507417 in CX on 777-300, A340, and 747 (now all retired) and think the A350 has the others beat.

"""the booking class was the biggest caveat""",5.0,W Davidson,2017-08-04,"✅ Verified Review |  Flew Cathay Pacific from Zurich to Bangkok via Hong Kong. Quality of the flight was good, the crew were friendly, food was ok (but not outstanding) and the special extra was the noodle soup that could be ordered as a snack anytime. The deciding factor to book this airline, was the 30kg baggage allowance, otherwise only given by by few other airlines (Thai Airways, Qatar Airways and Singapore Airlines are known to me). The other reason was the price. Booking early meant that we got the cheapest booking class, so the price was low, not lower than other airlines for their cheapest booking class. However the booking class was the biggest caveat. It's this bad, that I will never book this airline again. The problem is like this. When you get one of the the two lowest booking classes, you can't select your seat before check-in. When check-in opens 48 hours before the flight, there is a mouse race for the very last seats that haven't been reserved yet, as all other booking classes can select their seats before check-in. For us this meant that you either can't check-in online at all (as there are no seats to choose anymore), as it happened on the first way. Or you can select only separated seats for a couple travelling together, as it happened on the way back. The seats for the second leg we only got in transit, even the check-in staff at the counter couldn't give us any seats and of course we were not sitting together. So either you get a good price, but then the airline treats you as a second grade passenger, or you miss the good price and then there are better offers.

Boarding efficient, cabin had a comfortable feel and the seat was as good as those found on the economy class of SQ and TG A350s, but the charging port was hard to access, although not a problem for me, being a 2hr+ flight. Cathay provided the passengers with exterior camera views of the aircraft through the IFE, with a tail and front camera provided. Cabin crew were attentive, if robotic at times. However, the onboard drinks selection was a bit narrow, and the food served was dismal, comparable to my domestic flight on Air China. Overall, I would recommend Cathay, although they do need to ramp up their regional service if they want to compete on this route).",A350-900,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Bangkok,2017-07-01,5.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,5,yes,Singapore,Bangkok,cathay pacific airways
"""a less than comfortable experience""",6.0,G Anderson,2017-07-12,"✅ Verified Review |  I hadn't flown Cathay Pacific for a number of years, but I always remembered them being a very comfortable airline offering a better than average product. As a disclaimer, my airline of choice for this route (Los Angeles to Singapore via Hong Kong) has always been Singapore Airlines, so I realize I may have high standards. However, I'm still just an average economy traveler who simply expects to be taken care of on long flights. The trip out from LAX to SIN was a bit treacherous due to mechanical problems. This, I understand, but the way the airline handled it was - I'd say - less than satisfactory. I had a scheduled 01.25 departure that was delayed 11 hours. I was not made aware of the fact until 19.00 the night of my flight. The reason for the delay was the plane had engine problems when it was leaving HK (for LAX) and had to turn around, but what made it extremely confusing was that the airline somehow did not make the delay public knowledge (Google Flights, Flight Tracker and others had the flight noted as an on time departure), so there was quite a bit of confusion. I decided to arrive at the airport at my normal time (~2 hrs prior) at which point the delay was confirmed. I asked if they could put me on another flight of any other airline because I was going to SIN for a family emergency and I was told there were no available seats. They offered to put me up in a hotel which I accepted and gave me meal vouchers that didn't cover the cost of a single dish (for either dinner or breakfast - $25 and $15 respectively). The next morning upon check-in, I was told that my flights out were not full because they had moved many passengers to other flights/airlines - this really irritated me because I was told there were no available seats the night before. Once I finally arrived in HK (11.5 hours later than expected), my flight to SIN was delayed an additional 4 hours. At this point, I went to the CX counter and kindly asked for a pass to the lounge so I could rest and shower, since I'd already been delayed in my travels. They said they couldn't help me because they'd already compensated me in LA with the hotel stay. This irritated me; I understand that the airline may feel that I've been compensated, but I don't understand what it would have 'cost them' to provide a little extra customer service to a tired traveler asking to rest as a result of their delays. CX is based in HK and has multiple lounges in the airport. I suppose I was asking too much, but it was frustrating nonetheless. Both flights out felt both rushed and inadequately supplied (in terms of meals and personnel) making for a less than comfortable experience for such long flights. A route that normally takes me about 22-24 hours to complete (door to door) ended up taking about 37 hours and the overall experience left me with a slightly less than stellar opinion. I have to say, the flights back were on schedule and slightly better, but the overall experience was still not what I remember, nor what I'm currently used to. I would recommend CX because I know my initial experience was a bit of an anomaly, however, it does not change the fact that I am/was disappointed and wish the delays were handled better.",Boeing 777-300ER,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Singapore via Hong Kong,2017-07-01,2.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,3,yes,Los Angeles,Singapore ,cathay pacific airways

While the configuration decreased seat width, especially when it was converted to a bed, it was still cozy and comfortable. Service was a lot warmer and prompt. The food was surprisingly tasty even if CX catering isn't the best in the business. Drink selection was adequate, but not as extensive as SQ.

"""made me feel very inferior""",3.0,Valerie McClure,2017-07-08,"✅ Verified Review |  Auckland to London Heathrow via Hong Kong. On this flight I was seated in Premium Economy Row 33A. Boarding at Hong Kong was unorganized and chaotic, firstly being advised boarding was from gate 2, then later advised it was changed to gate 29. No announcements were made until boarding over 1 hour later than expected (which I find puzzling having flown multiple International flights with other airlines in the past 22 years). When boarding did commence again no boarding procedure as with other airlines which normally call for First and loyalty passengers boarding first or passengers with limited mobility and parents with young children. There were lines marked Business, Economy and it seemed most people queued in the Business line (which surprised me there were so many Business seats on this flight). When finally boarded 1 hour late the Captain announced the late departure was due to our plane being towed between gates, then having lost its departure slot had to wait with heavy number of aircraft ahead of us from China. This would have been perfectly acceptable if passengers were advised in the departure lounge. Onboard seats were good but not as comfortable as the flight from Auckland to Hong Kong on board CX198 which was an A350-900 (35G) However on the flight from Hong Kong to Heathrow we encountered problems in using the toilet as the toilet for Premium Economy passengers was situated in front of seats 32 H/K but the only access was by walking in front of 4 passengers seated in row 30 D-G which upset them due there being insufficient space to do this and resulted in fellow Premium Economy class passengers tripping over their out stretched legs and belongings. I am amazed that when designing an aircraft passenger accessibility is not taken into account and if they did they must have used a very small person to bypass very small upright people to gain access to this toilet or installed it with the view that only passengers seated on the right side of the aircraft would use it. I resorted to using the toilet in Business class as I had observed other PE passengers doing, however a flight attendant was waiting as I exited the toilet cubicle and commenced to give me a very severe dressing down who informed me I had no right being there and made me feel very inferior. I asked where I should go (I would like to point out at this stage that I am a 71 year old female with bladder problems) I was told it was preferable to use the toilets back near row 45 in Economy. This meant I had to queue up with the remaining 62 passengers seated in this Economy section of the aircraft. Not very satisfactory considering we had paid almost double the price of an Economy class ticket! Apart from this I found the Entertainment choices were really disappointing especially compared to the Entertainment on Emirates. There was very little choice of music or films and most were aimed at Asian audiences, in spite of a large proportion of the aircrafts passengers being European. Food was good but not brilliant, very little was offered in terms of pre dinner drinks. Would I fly or recommend this airline again, probably not given my experience and very disappointed after spending more than we normally do on airline tickets. However we have yet to return from Heathrow to Auckland at the end of August but doubt if they would have sorted out their toilet access by then!",A350 / Boeing 777-300ER,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Auckland to London via Hong Kong,2017-07-01,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2,no,Auckland,London ,cathay pacific airways

Business class seat in Cathay Pacific is cramped and narrow and although there is lots of privacy the seat gives a claustrofobic feel. Impossible to have a decent sleep on a 11 hour flight, because there is a lack of width. Service is not very attentive and food and beverage (especially the wines!) are more economy class level than premium level. First class lounge in HKG is great, although also here a lack of service of staff. The Seat on the new A350 is even more cramped and narrow, not suitable for long haul travel.

The seats were very uncomfortable. Many staff were extremely curt. It was a midnight 5 hour flight which was delayed. And they did not serve anything to us for the next 3 hour.

The flight is on time, arriving at the gate of Incheon airport at around 5.44am. The flight is quite smooth. The seat is quite comfortable. Note that this A333 economy seats have a fixed shell. The seatback is fixed. So the seat cannot recline backwards. Instead, the seat kind of slides down. I quite like this idea. It means that the monitor will never be too close to you and you will not be annoyed by the one in front of you. The legroom is great. I fell asleep easily before taking off. About an hour later, the meal is served. I was a bit disappointed that the meal was not an ordinary full size meal. There is no choice of main course. Usually there are two for passengers to choose from. The food is put inside a rectangle paper box, the box is quite nice actually. There is a small bowl containing a few slices of fruits, orange, kiwi, pineapple and one more. There is a sandwich with something like mayonnaise, salad. And there is a biscuit. That is all. I do anticipate more, but probably this is an overnight short flight, 3 hours and 40 minutes, departing at 1am. So Cathay thinks it is better to give you a light meal with mostly vegetables.

"""Catering is not CX's strong point""",7.0,Michael Mejia,2017-05-27,"✅ Verified Review |  I thought flying Cathay Pacific economy on an ultra long haul flight 3 weeks after returning from a similar distance in J would be a huge disappointment, but life (and CX) holds numerous surprises. Being a Marco Polo Club member allowed me to check in my entire family using the priority lanes on both outbound and return. The advantage was seen in the Manila to Hong Kong route where the check in queues at NAIA 3 seemed to snake around forever. Staff in MNL were courteous enough. Departing MNL through gate 111 was extremely chaotic. I would suggest that one hang around one of the pay-in lounges or in one of the (few) coffee shops outside the gate until the last minute. The MNL-HKG leg was the usual, rushed ultra short flight with absolutely no catering worth mentioning consisting of an overheated pastry, ANZAC cookie and boxed juice drink. PAL serves hot meals on their MNL-HKG flights even in economy, I wonder why a carrier such as CX still continues to think that this budget airline move is worthy of a 5-star airline? Same experience on the return HKG-MNL leg. The long haul product proved to be a pleasant surprise. The seats were more comfortable than expected and the 3-3-3 configuration does a lot for the perception of space in the back cabin. Catering is not CX's strong point, but the meals served were actually edible. The snack option of cup noodles were very tasty and the galley snack tray was always full. In-flight staff were pretty good with ready smiles and service. Good and frequent drink runs were made throughout the 16 hour journey both ways. I would say that it was a pleasant surprise through the long haul leg.

The flight attendants were professional. Hong Kong to Vancouver on a 9-year old 777-300ER. I would say the thing that stood out to me most on this flight was the cabin crew, who were proactive.

At Vancouver check-in the lady who checked me in was cheerful and funny, contrary to my previous experiences while checking in in Vancouver. I was initially supposed to fly in Premium Economy Class for the entire itinerary until I was notified of a seat change on my flight from Vancouver to Hong Kong. An upgrade to Business Class was definitely a true blessing on a transpacific flight and I couldn't be more impressed with the service I received. The Cathay Pacific lounge in Vancouver provides such a serenade prior to a long-haul flights, where the staff were so accommodating. The crew were prompt to respond to requests and made me feel welcome and comfortable. The seat didn't feel too different from the regular Premium Economy seat in terms of width, however, when turned into a flat bed, provided one of the best sleeps I've had among other Business Class I have experienced. I appreciated the details put into the seat,  adequate storage and the mirror in one of the compartments, and light at one of the storage areas. Despite all the positives, I felt indifferent towards the catering. Though the main courses and drinks were great, there were components of the meals that left me underwhelmed. Arrived Hong Kong on schedule and made my way to The Wing lounge. Staff were enthusiastic to help. Hong Kong to Bangkok in a bulkhead seat in Premium Economy Class. Despite my love towards the bulkhead seat on Cathay's Economy, I was at fault for selecting this bulkhead in Premium Economy. The fact that the personal screen couldn't be used during take-off and landing made for a very boring flight for me, again, not at all the airline's fault. Since it was a regional flight, meal service was similar to that of Economy Class, and it was a standard breakfast meal which satisfied me. Crew service on this short flight left a bit to be desired, but since it was a rather early morning flight, the cabin itself seemed dry. Bags were among the first ones out in Bangkok and I was out of the airport within 30 minutes of arriving. On-time departure and arrival on both flights.

Went to the gate soon after having some food in the lounge. The first class cabin was small, however as you will sit in your own suite, it didnt feel small at all when settlted in. The crew was not as pleasant as the inbound crew. The food was a let down. Again the drink was nice and due to my experience on the outbound, I retracted the lumbar massage tool, and the seat became a fully flat bed and was wide on the shoulder area, so I could put my arms on the side. I asked for an extra duvet from the crew for comfort, but the due to the cabin was fully booked, the crew gave me a biz class blanket, which was less desirable.

It was exceptional, three choices of champagne and probably the best hamburger and chips I've tasted. Sat on row 33K, the last row in the cabin. The recline was excellent and liked the leg rest - I am 5ft 5"" so works well for me. Pre departure drinks were juice, water or a glass of champagne. The food was okay, not as good as the outbound, the starter salad was a bit bland, I enjoyed my lamb and mash main, but my wife found the halibut needed more sauce. Dessert was Hagan Das ice cream. The choice of drinks were standard Economy, which actually wasn't bad. I did have a Chivas Regal with ginger but then stuck to water. Breakfast was either scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon and potatoes or a dim sum set, I had the former and it was okay, nothing special. There were plenty of snacks available throughout thr flight such as cookies, crisps, chocolate and cup noodles - just help yourself at the galley at the rear of the plane. In flight entertainment was excellent with some quite recent films, such as Star Wars Rogue One and Sing, which have just been released on DVD. Crew were sound, attentive and made regular water runs throughout the overnight flight. If there is one area of improvement is a dedicated PE toilet would be great.

This enabled more sleeping time. Seats were good and flat bed. The only improvement which could be made would be for a mattress cover to be provided as is done by Qantas. It helps smooth out the bumps in the seat. The entertainment system is also good. The additional bonus of Cathay is the use of the Wings lounge in Hong Kong.

Breakfast served before arrival in London I chose the Dim Sum selection, which was good and did not taste like it had been on a plane for 12 hours!

The only thing I can find fault with is the food service which is perhaps the biggest disappointment and certainly could be stepped up a notch to give a top rated PE experience. This return flight was very full. We left the gate a few minutes late but arrived on time. Despite it being full, the PE cabin was served with the usual efficiency and professionalism of CX. The only downside to the 4.20pm flight is the absence of a dedicated toilet for the PE cabin but otherwise a great flight which was enjoyable and passed quickly and comfortably.

I have previously flown Cathay Pacific long haul and regionally within Asia in business class and have nothing but praise for the whole experience. This was the first time I have flown in coach with them. My only complaint is the seat itself. It was one of the most uncomfortable seats I have ever sat in. I was in the first row of the economy section so leg room was also partially restricted because of the bulkhead, but it also had virtually no recline and the seat back was almost like a piece of wood. The flight was almost 5 hours and was pretty uncomfortable. Not taking the bulkhead would have been better as I would have at least been able to stretch my legs under the seat in front. I'm only 5' 10"" so it's not like I'm overly tall. If you do want bulkhead in the first row then select the 3 seats on the window side as they do have more legroom.

On the return journey (Hong Kong to London), as I dropped off my luggage very early at the airport, I was very kindly offered the chance to switch to an earlier flight. However, I declined it as I didn’t want to lose my seat selection (aisle seat). It was nice to have been offered, though. Boarding of my original flight was then delayed by an hour without warning, due to ‘technical reasons’. This was poorly communicated to the hundreds of passengers waiting at the gate, until the original departure time had elapsed. We were then advised by word of mouth (not the public intercom) to come back to the gate in an hour. This created a lot of sense of uncertainty as to what was happening with our flight.

Airlines in the region have cut back on quality of service, noticeable in aspects such as a lower quality of food, and cabins that are not as clean or upgraded as often as they could be. Cathay Pacific Airways still has a 2-3-2 configuration on its A330 planes and this configuration does not support a premium experience when business class customers still have to climb over someone to get to the lav. One must choose one's seat wisely. Despite this, I believe that Cathay remains the best of premium airlines in the region. FA service was top notch and when the my experience is compared to North American or European carriers on flights of a similar length, Cathay is superior. The meal served on the flight while not as good as it used to be was still respectable. Beverage selection was good. Baggage delivery, airport experience in both BKK and HKG was excellent.

"""I can still recommend Cathay""",8.0,D Steminie,2017-01-10,"✅ Verified Review |  After a gap of almost 15 years, I booked a return ticket from Paris CDG to Bangkok via Hong Kong, as I was curious to see what had changed. A first inconvenience occurred when, for the return journey, I was rebooked from BKK to HKG on an earlier flight, without any explanation, this causing a much longer connecting time in HKG while waiting my flight back to Paris. The day of my departure from Paris happened to be the maiden flight of A350 between CDG and HKG. The plane was full, and, for the reason of late cargo loading, we got 55 minutes delay. At this moment, while still on the ground I knew my connecting flight to BKK would be missed. When arriving in HKG, 12 hours later, a new boarding pass was swiftly given to me, with an attached voucher reaching the generous value of a hamburger at any airport Mc Donald’s. I had to wait 4 hours instead of 75 minutes in terminal. A bit disappointed on this situation, its handling of passenger being a little careless. Besides this not-so-good story, everything went smoothly. Cabins clean and cabin crew delivering a top quality service, efficient and professional. The attendants were well groomed, responsive and pleasant. CX catering, if compared to Emirates, is a little below in term of product, but the food is tastier, aiming at natural non-sophisticated dishes, rather than fancy bland food, and wine is served in generous portions. The IFE is satisfactory, with a decent variety of movies and TV shows. Comfort inflight is correct for economy class. Seat configuration 3-3-3 on 777’s and A350, and seat pitch is good. I regret that footrests have disappeared. Similarly, no longer hot towels and amenity kits in economy class. I would not applaud the ergonomy of meal trays, slipping on tablets, with not well stackable cups, and equipped with plastic cutlery instead of stainless (by the way, spreading butter with such curved knives is a real challenge for a left-handed like me). By and large, I can still recommend Cathay Pacific on the Asia-Europe route.

Once off, they came round to take order for the late night supper which consisted of caviar, salmon, an extensive choice of Western and Chinese food. I was not hungry and ordered only a Chinese soup which was hot and very flavourful. I must have looked very tired and the crew suggested me to go get changed and they would set up the bed for me. When I returned, my seat turned into a very comfortable and wide bed. The crew proposed a cup of camomile tea which I gladly accepted.

Bangkok to Hong Kong sector was operated was a slightly older Boeing 777-200 but with a refreshed cabin. Cabin crew was enthusiastic as per Cathay's standards and exceeded my expectations for a 2-hour flight. Since I haven't experienced a ""regular"" Economy seat in a while now (I normally book bulkhead seats), I was shocked (in a good way) as to how much leg room there actually is. It's amazing how an extra inch of pitch can make a difference in flight. Hong Kong to Vancouver on a 1-year old 777-300ER, and honestly, it was my best experience of all the trips I've made on this sector. I reckon the majority of the crew are Vancouver-based, which I have noticed from the diversity of nationalities, as well as more attentive service as a whole. I'm not saying those of Hong Kong-based are inferior, but I definitely find the latter tend to rush the service a little. With that being said, this flight was excellent. FAs were responding to requests promptly, also going out of their way to give more than expected. Pushback and taxiing at Hong Kong were early, as the captain was trying to make up time for the surprisingly long flight time (11 hr 40 min, compared to the usual 10 hr 30 min).

For me the only difference between the two aircrafts were the slightly bigger windows in the A350 and the onboard camera on the top tail on the A350 . The Movie selection is one of the best.

With Cathay, you can be assured that you will be well fed. I was given a free over night accommodation and free breakfast in Hong Kong Airport Hotel.

"""disappointing in terms of service""",7.0,Stefan Oelze,2017-01-01,"✅ Verified Review |  Dusseldorf to Hong Kong. Having had high expectations, my first business class flight with Cathay was somewhat disappointing in terms of service. The new business class seats are great, providing great privacy and space. However, the inflight service could be improved. Dinner service started late and took a long time. Also, being in the last row of business (there are two rows in a separate cabin just in front of premium economy) meant that the food was almost cold by the time it got to us. Service attention was patchy - tea for breakfast was served long after the tray was put down. Maybe it was that we were in the ""forgotten"" area, but it really was not a service experience that I would expect from all the things I had heard about Cathay. Also, the fact that premium economy passengers get to use the business class lavatories means a great deal of disturbance being seated on the alley. And lastly, having almost 5 minutes of advertising before the inflight entertainment starts, is a bit much, in my view. Watching TV series meant having to fast-forward every time. And, lastly, the question whether business class passengers should pay for Wifi access or not - or should at least have one hour for free.

"""overall, a pleasant experience""",7.0,W Patakun,2016-12-18,"✅ Verified Review |  Vancouver to Bangkok via Hong Kong during the Christmas peak travel season. I was unimpressed right from the start. Whatever happened to Cathay's ground staff in Vancouver isn't good and should be fixed immediately. Barely any smiles or greetings for frequent flyers and seemed ignorant to all requests and questions. My flight was delayed by 45 minutes and I asked if I could be moved my connecting flight to Bangkok in order to ensure both me and my bags make it. I got a response of ""No, the flight still shows on-time arrival. You will have plenty of time, plus, since you have a tight connection, your bags will be off-loaded first."" From previous experiences, any delays when flying against the jet stream through the Pacific Ocean mean extra delays, which is exactly what happened on this flight. Flight time to Hong Kong from Vancouver was 14 hours, approximately an hour longer than usual. Landed Hong Kong 45 minutes late, and I had to run for my life across the busy terminal to make my connection to Bangkok. I asked the ground staff at the gate in Hong Kong to check if my luggage has made it and by the time the flight was closing, they still ""weren't able to locate my bags"". I was discouraged and accepted the fact that my bags were going to miss the flight yet again. Landed in Bangkok on time, one of my bags showed up which was a blessing but the other took a later flight and got delivered to my house. Economy seats on the Boeing 777-300ER are great, one of the best in the industry in fact. While I was rushing to board my flight to Bangkok, which was operated on the Airbus A350-900 (exciting!), my boarding pass got an error message and hence I got upgraded to Premium Economy Class for the flight. The A350 cabin is by far one of the best in the skies nowadays and Cathay Pacific has properly defined the meaning of ""Premium Economy"" perfectly: the extra legroom, the seat amenities, the IFE, just to name a few. Food was amazing for Economy, edible and appropriate portions. Advice: Don't get the pasta unless you really have to. Go with the Western or Asian menu. Cabin crew service continues to be top notch on both flights, especially on the short-haul from Hong Kong to Bangkok.

The rose flavored prosecco cocktail handed out during boarding was very good, and I enjoyed the choice of wines.

While my meals were provided with water, I could still ask for the other drinks every passenger is allowed to ask for, and got one strawberry ice cream. As snacks, there were peanuts, crisps/chips, apples and instant noodles. On the short HK-Taipei flight, I was given a chickpea pie, and a chickpea sandwich on my way back. Got lucky enough to be upgraded to premium thanks to the Chinese new year rush, so I could compare the premium and the regular economy classes. Only difference is leg room, a few discount vouchers to expensive stores and armrests, along with earplugs and blindfolds. I was still fine with regular leg room though, only missed the airplugs and blindfold on my way back.

With the option of meals on request, throughout the duration of the flight, cabin attendants were scurrying up and down the aisles serving food and removing plates and table cloths, lights coming up, glare from the entertainment screen.  Flight attendants on both airlines are attentive, speak good English.  The entertainment systems were quite comprehensive on both segments of Qatar Airways but only so on Cathay's HKG-JFK segment. An ipad was provided on CCU-HKG sector. Amenities bags were provided on all segments. Quality and portions of food are comparable and both airlines offer a complement of international drinks. Schedule - Qatar leaves CCU at the unearthly hour of 3:30 at night; Cathay's departure is slightly more sensible at just past 1 an night. The transit time at both hubs - DOH and HKG are similar - and the overall journey is slightly faster on Qatar Airways by an hour or so. The flights were all on schedule. Transiting  Hong Kong is a more relaxing and well-organized airport to transit though a bus carried us between two terminals. The security check had no crowds. Doha presented a picture of huge crowds, the security check area looked frantic. The flight announcement board was crammed with information that it was impossible to locate your connecting flight gate.  I found the Wings lounge very appealing  from the range of food and drinks to the reliability of the wi-fi service to the cleanliness of the shower facilities. I used the lounge at Doha to escape the crowd, did not try the food or the showers, but it was comfortable though the wi-fi service was spotty. The fare is comparable and you can earn miles on both airlines by being a OneWorld member. So, overall, while both airlines offered a good quality product, I give a slight edge to Cathay Pacific -- for departure time, transfer at Hong Kong, and the privacy offered by the cabin layout. It does take a little bit longer to fly through Hong Kong than through Doha and while Qatar's 787 is a splendid plane, you cannot really enjoy it - you board the aircraft and go to sleep as soon as the plane takes off, but you do get to sleep on the flat bed seat, an option not available on Cathay Dragon's standard business seat in its A320.",A320 / Boeing 777-300,Solo Leisure,Business Class,CCU to JFK via HKG,2016-10-01,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5,yes,CCU,JFK ,cathay pacific airways

TV screen is larger. Lights go off quicker than economy. Bad points, is it worth 3x the price?, depends on how full the plane is, if it is empty in economy then probably no. Configuration of 4 seats in middle is poor, economy 3 seats. The seat pitch could be more, Cathay used to have 34 inch pitch in economy, now 31 inch, so 3x for an extra 3 original inches is not good, buying two seats in economy would give you more room.

Also, is it even hygienic having all the exposed food with the crew member standing directly over it talking to passengers as she progresses down the aisle. Give me the 1 on 1 delivery anytime as with most carriers, much more personalised.

My rack of lamb consisted of 2 of the smallest lamb cutlets possible (overcooked and dry) with a spoonful of risotto and 1 cherry tomato.  The sea bass was also terribly overcooked and barely warm.

I must say I was pretty underwhelmed. First leg was a overnight flight and sitting in seat 20k in 4 class configuration it was impossible to sleep due to the constant vibration of the engine with the seat being directly above the wing. Return journey was in seat 16k in 3 class configuration and was much quieter. Food was pretty poor standard on both legs for business class, not worth the premium paid. Also on the return flight I requested a burger from the order as you wish range, however half way through the 12 hour flight the cabin staff were already out of them. I then requested the won ton soup noodle, this also unavailable. The flight attendant offered me a bowl of noodles with, in her words is ""a powdered chicken stock"".

Otherwise, the service was average in my opinion: Ok crew, but seemed that they were rather just doing their job. The possibility to go and get snacks during the flight at the rear of the plane was nice, there were many things to choose from. Cathay also profits from Hongkong airport being a very serviceable and attractive hub for connecting flights with lots to see and do.

"""should show consistency""",3.0,V Anderson,2016-06-29,"✅ Verified Review |  I believe that a 5 star airline should show consistency in the service provided. After a great flight to Europe with Cathay Pacific I had a pretty bad experience with a regional flight. They announced a 4 hour delay at BKK airport. For this I received a vouched of 70HKD (yes 70) for a ""dinner"" in one of the outlets. My hunt for an outlet that was happy to accept it has been pretty long. After a long but nice wait at their new lounge I boarded and surprise - the aircraft is fitted with the hard shell seats. The worst recline ever experienced. I believe that European low cost airlines have bigger recline than this ""premium"" airline. As often happens with CX the food was not good for western's taste. And as often happens they underestimated (or under communicate) the actual scale of the delay, being almost one hour longer than officially stated. From a premium airline I expect more.

Red-eye flight between Hong Kong and New York Kennedy with a stopover in Vancouver. Transit passengers from HKG boarded prior to passengers departing from YVR through a gate with partition in between. Boarding for YVR-originating passengers was a bit hectic, and gate agents were running around trying to get priority boarding completed before general boarding began. I was granted priority boarding, thanks to the benefits of their frequent flyer program. I was greeted with enthusiasm and warmth by the purser, a great way to start a trip. Business Class was very empty, Premium Economy was almost full, and Economy was 80% full (a lot of the middle seats were empty). Personally, I felt like the crew were able to provide a more comfortable service, as there was no hassle to get through the meal service. Choice of food were either rice with chicken in a black bean sauce, or braised beef with mashed potatoes. I went with the rice option, and needless to say, it was one of the best meals I've ever had on CX. Flight departed YVR and landed in JFK ahead of schedule.

However the meal timings were quite odd. The flight left SFO at 1:30 am. and after an hour, around 2:30 am, they began to serve drinks and then dinner, it is not practical. After drinks they should have just served some light snacks. Who wants to have dinner at 2:30 am? Its obvious people were not hungry and eager to sleep, so most of the passengers wasted the good food. then after that there was no food service; only juice was served every hour or so quietly so as not to disturb the sleep. Around 6 or 7 in the morning (SF time), people were getting hungry and all that they had available was apples and chips and cookies. Thats the time when everyone needed a good breakfast! Then just one hour before landing they served breakfast, which was around 4 am Hong Kong time (destination). there was hardly any time before landing, so people had to eat hurriedly. This is quite absurd. They need to serve meals at appropriate timings. Someone needs to tell them that. The toilets were being cleaned regularly, but with a full capacity flight the trash bins were almost always full and overflowing! The flight was full but the checkin staff did not make any effort to allot seats together for families, many seats were pre-booked and many family members had to sit separately throughout the 13 hour flight.

Granted the seats are quite neat and you get a little luxury compared to the tightly packed economy. But I feel that food and service is actually not much better than what you receive in economy. They offered me a drink just before take off. They handed me one bottle of water shortly before serving me food. I did not want a full blown meal at 2 am and asked for the light option which was advertised as soup. But instead they gave me a disgusting salad with some fruit in a dish. Ate the fruit and left everything else. After sleeping for the best part of the journey the next offering after only three visits was offer of juice and tea. Followed closely by breakfast offering. Thankfully recognise able in the form of scrambled egg with hash brown and a streak of bacon. Shortly followed by another offering of juice. I asked for tea which never appeared. That was that. Am I expecting too much? Family flew economy on the way out with me and from what they told me they had more attention and food / drink offerings than me. Something not quite right here.

"""does not represent value for money""",5.0,B Moore,2016-04-23,"My wife and I recently traveled Melbourne-Hong Kong return with Cathay Pacific. Having previously taken this trip a number of times as economy class passengers we decided to pay the extra and try premium economy (PE), not a good decision. Our problems started when checking in at Melbourne airport. Although booked as Mr and Mrs, we were advised that we were not sitting together. After some discussion crew resolved this at the gate lounge. However, on the return flight we were told once again that we would not be seated together, actually behind each other in the center of the middle three seats. Notwithstanding our objections we were dismissed by ground staff and advised that there was nothing they could do about our situation. On previous flights with other airlines, domestic and international, we have always managed to be seated together when booked as a couple. The dinner meal choices were very limited. There was actually only one choice, as the other listed meal had apparently run out prior to the food cart arriving in the PE section. In addition to this the tray tables in my row could not be deployed without considerable effort and the assistance of other passengers and crew. When combined with the issue of sharing economy toilets at the rear of the aircraft it occurs to me that there is really nothing to suggest that Cathay Premium Economy class is anything more than a more expensive ‘economy’ ticket with a somewhat larger seat. Lots of ‘economy’ and not a lot of ‘premium’. While performance on the day depends entirely on the crew encountered, in my opinion the overall performance of the airline has deteriorated since we first traveled with them five years ago. Based on our recent experience I would not recommend Cathay Pacific ‘Premium Economy’ it does not represent value for money.

There was a great selection of movies and such; but I was sleeping for most of the flight. Drink and food service after take-off could have been more prompt (it was served about 1.5 hours after take-off) - which shortened the time available for sleep.

FA’s friendly and attentive, present in the cabin without being obtrusive. I found the lie-flat seats to be very comfortable and the herringbone 1-2-1 arrangement on both planes great. While the seat on the A330 clearly showed some wear and tear, everything was in working order. Food out of LHR was ok without being great. Dinner was a rather bland lobster appetizer and salad, followed by a braised pork cheek with root vegetables (or Chinese stir fried beef or herb chicken breast or pumpkin pasta in cheese sauce), plus cheese, fruit and cake for dessert. Breakfast was a breakfast frittata (or apple pancake or chicken and mushroom congee). Full warn breakfast, but again not that convincing. Food out of HKG was much better. The halibut curry was of restaurant quality. Other choices were pork spare ribs or Australian beef tenderloin or pasta in a tomato basil sauce. Starter was Cajun prawn (good as well) and again various dessert choices. Second meal before landing was seafood pie (tasty) or beef noodle soup. The wines that I tried were good without being great. IFE (CX studio) was AVOD; responsive and with ok screens. Selection was varied, however a little light on new Western releases. Commercials before every selection were slightly irritating, but you could fast forward, so not a big deal. Constant commercials during the flight map were just irritating. Restrooms were kept clean throughout both flights – CX Lounge in LHR was closed for renovation. I used BA’s Galleries Lounge which in T3 is a comfortable and relaxing place with ok food and drinks - much better than the alternative option of the AA Admirals Club. Check in in HKG was fast and hassle-free with no lines. I used CX The Wing lounge, which is excellent with various service areas including a manned bar and a made to order noodle station.

The journey was pretty much flawless, planes were clean and new, staff was very professional, food was quite good, seat was very comfortable and spacious enough, and there was a good selection of movies to watch during the flight. The pilots flying were also quite enthusiastic when delivering announcements to the pax, which is a detail I always enjoy. I would definitely recommend this airline.

"""upgrade to Business Class""",10.0,Mandart Chan,2016-01-08,"Hong Kong to Vancouver. When you show up at the airport with one bag that is obviously too heavy, one should have a plan of action. My plan was that I was going to use my Asia Miles to pay for the extra weight. Luckily, I was served by the Check-in Counter Team Leader and he said I could either use 24,000 Miles for the excess weight (it was very heavy) or use 20,000 Miles to upgrade from Premium Economy to Business Class (and not have to pay for excess weight.) I didn't think seats were available, he said there was 1 left and it was mine. So, with only 5 minutes of waiting, I was given my Business class seat, my lounge invitation and I was on my way! Went to the Bridge Lounge (essentially two lounges in 1) then to Gate 2 for departure. The plane departed on-time and it was a very full flight. The champagne along with great meal services made the flight home fly by (pun intended). Even with the large amount of Business Class passengers, the Chief Purser made her way and introduced herself to each and everyone of us. I didn't think she would remember our names, but during the flight, whenever she saw me, she referred to me by name and asked how my flight was going. With the re-branding, CX also released a new animated Safety Briefing, along with new Safety Cards. My only complaint is the lack of the air conditioning controls for the seats, and the lack of air flow to the Business Class seats when you are sleeping.

Unfortunately, the gate agents (who were also the ticket agents) didn't update the YVR passengers on when we would be able to board. The cabin crew for this part of the flight were also waiting with us and they didn't have any ideas on when we would be able to depart. Eventually, approximately an hour later, we all boarded and took off for HKG. Service on board was amazing. The initial drink service into the dinner service was quick and efficient.

Cabin nearly full.  Flight deck announcement was clear and informative. Some turbulence during the flight and arrived a few minutes ahead of schedule.  Made the trip from Hong Kong to San Francisco in about 11 hours and 28 minutes. Once airborne, supper service with drinks. Cheese plate available on request. Service was concluded in about two hours so plenty of time to rest and sleep. Since I was upgraded, my main meal was from economy in disposable tray placed on a ceramic plate. The salad was awful with no dressing and fruit salad as dessert, both in plastic economy containers but transferred to a tray with cloth napkin and metal cutlery. Vegetarian option, either western or Asian, are always awful and disgusting on Cathay Pacific. Asian options are usually overcooked vegetable in oily sauce served with steamed rice. Western options are typically some sort of pasta swimming in tomato based sauce. Anyway did not eat much of the food other than the fruit salad. Cabin crew friendly and available through the flight. Since I was upgraded from premium economy I was mostly ignored and not served additional food items such as dessert tray or cheese plate. Slept for a few hours. Woke up hungry and had to ask for some fresh fruit but was told that they did not have fresh fruit onboard but she will check in the economy cabin. She came back with left over cheese plate and fruit bowl from left over supper service. Watched a few movies and it was time for pre-arrival breakfast. This is strange as we were arriving into San Francisco International Airport at 9PM why they were serving breakfast at that hour? Would prefer to have light snacks such as a sandwich or a bowl of soup.  The pre-arrival snack again was transferred to the meal tray from economy cabin. Some kind of corn and something else and salad minus dressing plus fresh cut fruit for desert. Noticed one thing in both premium economy and business class is that Cathay Pacific has eliminated salt and pepper in both cabins. In premium economy cabin you used to get salt and pepper sachets and stone shakers in business cabin but not for the last 3 trips. Immigration is a breeze at that hour and custom was quick. Bags took a while to come out, more than typical. Overall an OK flight in business.

I suspect the fog at many key European airports over this time was the background cause of the delays but it was difficult to find out if this was a major reason. I wish Cathay and other airlines would follow British Airways example and allow the Captain to provide a nice full comprehensive weather and flight briefing as these aspects can help forward planning a lot when travelling on business. Nevertheless, I was put up in a nice airport hotel in Hong Kong and then had impeccable service from the wonderful cabin crew en-route to Zurich. Only one aspect spoilt this flight experience and that was the final meal - it was possibly the worst airline meal I have ever had. I found out that even with a major delay of 9 hours or more, the same food is kept for that particular flight making it some 21 hours before it is finally consumed - and it tasted like it too! Unfortunately I had this meal after I had filled in the Customer Satisfaction Survey so it would not be recorded in there - otherwise a good flight but I will never forget that supper meal on Cathay Pacific.",Boeing 777-300,Business,Premium Economy,Hong Kong to Zurich,2015-11-01,4.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,5,yes,Hong Kong,Zurich,cathay pacific airways

I was particularly impressed that during the night flight, the nearby galley was in semi-darkness to avoid disturbing passengers' sleep, and the 2 stewardesses in the galley were talking quietly. We used 3 lounges at HKG: the WIng, the Bridge and Arrivals. All had showers, and plenty of choice, though both the Wing and the Bridge got very busy around 23.30 as there are a number of departing flights at that time. The Boeing 777-300 in particular is very comfortable with lots of storage space. The A340 was the only aircraft where the seat was less comfortable (the so-called coffin seat). I'd ordered a veggie meal: this was delivered on all flights but instead of just the main meal being vegetarian, the whole tray was a dedicated veggie tray; what this means is that I had no choice at all of entree or dessert, though there were vegetarian alternatives available. The crew did their best to accommodate my preference but in future I don't think I'll bother to order a veggie meal as it is easy enough (in business class) to choose suitable options from the main menu.

Pajamas, slippers and a nice Aesop wash bag were given out. Meals show signs of some cost-cutting over the past five years, and my veal main entree for lunch was overcooked and dry. Beverage choices including wines were very good. The refreshed First Class Suite is still outstanding, and I prefer it to the total enclosures used by some airlines. Washrooms were maintained throughout the 14-hour flight, and staff attentive and available. Cabin staff walk through the cabin periodically, but also responds very promptly to the call button.

"""service practically non existent""",3.0,Alison Chambers,2015-10-15,"The food on Cathay Pacific Airways was truly atrocious - I had ordered a gluten free meal and they seem to think that offering a plate of salad leaves and a few pieces of green limp peppers is the best they can do. The normal menu was a piece of salmon which would have been completely fine - clearly they have no clue as to what contains gluten and err on the side of extreme caution. The breakfast served on arrival into Hong Kong was marginally better and actually looked more palatable then the congealed food offered on the normal menu, so much so that I decided not to cancel the gluten free meal for my return journey - big mistake! Breakfast on flight back into Manchester was what looked like a piece of steak with lump mash - disgusting! Most of the staff onboard on the way out were friendly however the purser was rude and the not the customer service you would expect whether you were travelling in economy or business class. The service on the way back was practically non existent as they clearly expect on a 0100hrs flight that no one will expect anything - only one drink offered prior to the meal service and nothing offered with the actual meal. On request of a bottle of water - it arrived 20 mins later. The seats are fine, however the inflight entertainment needs a serious upgrade in comparison to other airlines.

The Cathay attendants and ground staff were excellent on both legs of my trip. The seats really are first rate and Cathay Pacific business is the equal of first on some airlines.

ZRH lounge is a bit better, but not great. If you are flying on to other destinations it's a bit of a drag to have to route your trip through ZRH and connections on the return trip may require a night spent at ZRH depending on the departure time.

But you do have to share the toilets with the economy passengers, which is a problem at busy times, and does put me off a little.

"""got off the flight feeling fresh""",8.0,Paul Sprich,2015-09-22,"This was my first flight to Europe in Premium Economy. I have flown Premium Economy to Asia with Qantas and BA but 8 hours is a lot different to 24 hrs.  The width of the Cathay Pacific premium economy seat and armrest are big enough that you do not touch the person next to you and do not feel restricted when eating. I had a bulkhead to HKG and it is the best option but the leg rest is a little short - putting my cabin bag on the floor overcame that issue. To Paris I was one row back, so only had the foot rest but it was still okay. When the seat in front is on full recline there is still plenty of room. 8 inches of recline doesn't sound much but combined with the seat width it is surprisingly good enough to get some good sleep. There is separate boarding for PE and this works well and they make it very clear that you are not in Economy. A glass of champagne before take-off is always nice. I read reports that cabin staff can be absent during the flight. and to a degree that's right, but they are very friendly and efficient. If you request something via the call button they are quick to respond so I was happy. IFE is as good as anyone else. Its not Business Class, but that does not mean its uncomfortable or basic. The Premium Economy cabin is curtained off from economy so you do feel a little privileged but get brought down to earth each time you have to share the Economy toilets. I got off the flight feeling fresh, which to me, was a compliment to the product. I think the Qantas seat and environment on the A380 (not the 747) is slightly better but its only marginal. Cathay Pacific nudges ahead of BA by a similar small margin. You wouldn't be unhappy with PE on any of the carriers but what I think what makes Cathay Pacific Premium Economy of choice is that, apart from a quality product, they have priced it ""on the money"" and this puts them ahead of Qantas. If you've got an appropriate tier status with Oneworld you get to use Business or First Class Lounges en route and the CX ones are very good (particularly The Wing in HKG) which adds to the overall comfort of the flight.",A330 / Boeing 777-300,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Melbourne to Paris via HKG,2015-09-01,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4,yes,Melbourne,Paris ,cathay pacific airways

My wife and I were flying business class, my 2 children were flying Economy. My Gold membership allowed me to have 1 guest + myself which mean 1 of my child were not entitled for the lounge.

A comfortable Boeing 777 with 9-across seating, so the comfort of Singapore Airlines. Which made it very strange that the meal service was so shambolic. Staff disappeared for long periods, passed meals amongst each other which then disappeared and required the staff to go look for more. The bun was hot on the outside but cold in the middle.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,9.0,B Crockford,2015-08-21,"Just prior to boarding time, announcement that the aircraft was experiencing technical issues and would be delayed. The delay ended up being 5 hours as the original issue couldn't be fixed and a new plane was required. The CX gate staff took a fair amount of grief from a few vociferous individuals during this time and whilst they could be criticised for not providing information in a timely manner and on occasion promising an update within 10 mins and not delivering that for 30 mins or so, CX should be complimented for how quickly they ended up getting us away. First off, no one should question an airline that delays departure because of a technical issue. Assuming it took an hour or so to determine that the fault could not be fixed, and a replacement aircraft required, it then took CX less than 4 hours to find that aircraft, ensure it was in operational condition, fuel it up, unload the previous aircraft, load up the new aircraft and no doubt complete copious amounts of paperwork. On top of this, a replacement pilot was required due to the restrictions on working hours. During the delay CX offered vouchers to cover an adequate snack and also provided complimentary bottles of water at the gate.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,3.0,Norman Powell,2015-08-13,"Apart from a delayed take-off the flight Paris-Hong Kong (B777) was un-eventful. Seats were a bit hard but good legroom. Good entertainment system. Pre-dinner drink service well received. Meals rather bland and tasteless. No cabin service to speak of. Hong Kong-Adelaide flight (A330) late take off due to disorganised boarding procedure and extra security checks inside the airbridge, which seem pretty brief, pointless and frustrating to me. Seat comfort better than B777 but seemed like less legroom. Entertainment system had no sound, FA went to check but never returned. Another FA was blunt to the point of rudeness when I tried to use toilet 40 minutes after take off because seat belt sign was still on - yet 6 other passengers had already done so and several others were on their feet. No pre-dinner drinks service. During meal service FA spilled a glass of wine into my lap. Noisy sleepless flight. Not happy. My rating below is based on this flight. In respect of all four of our Cathay Pacific flights to Paris return I was disappointed with the on-line check in and seat selection process. Not once did we get the seats we pre-booked nor did the on-line check in work properly. I chose Cathay Pacific because of their previous top rating.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,8.0,Nicholas Whitehouse,2015-07-31,"I found the staff to be very friendly and helpful. The plane was very clean, had good entertainment options and the food was lovely. However I felt the layout of Premium Economy wasn't the best as there is only one toilet in Premium which is located on the right hand side of the cabin. This meant every passenger on the left side who needed to use the rest room (which could be several times on a 14 hour flight) would have to cross the bulkhead seats (which is where I was sat) at the front of the cabin. If you plan to sleep do not select these seats as you will be knocked by passengers trying to cut across to use the rest room. I also felt CP have tried to fit too many seats in the bulkhead row of the middle section. I feel the end two seats impede the aisle from business class so when catering came through the curtain from business to premium there is a good chance your left leg might take a bump. Three seats in this row would probably be a better option. The seats could have been a little comfier for the money paid. The only downfall on the entertainment was that it was a little light on choice, I've traveled other airlines in premium economy and they had a healthier selection of films. Overall I would travel with Cathay Pacific again but will probably spend the extra money to fly in business class.",Boeing 777-300ER (77H) Four Class,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,L.A to Hong Kong,2015-07-01,2.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4,yes,L.A,Hong Kong,cathay pacific airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,2.0,Jon Morgan,2015-07-25,"I recently flew Cathay Business Class from Singapore to London and back, via Hong Kong - a total of four sectors. While three of these flights varied from acceptable to quite good, the final leg from Hong Kong back to Singapore was awful. Having arrived late (see below) from London, we boarded yet another delayed flight only to find that, without any prior notification to us, they had switched the aircraft from the one on which we had booked our seats to one with the old A330 series 2-3-2 Business Class configuration. Not only is this more like sitting in Premium Economy, my wife and I were now separated by a passenger in the centre seat between us, with whom we had to negotiate a swap. With the flight already twenty minutes late, it was then announced that we had to wait for connecting passengers from yet another delayed Cathay flight, and we eventually pushed back from the gate 50 minutes late. Once airborne things didn't improve. While the crew were courteous enough, the food was an absolute disgrace for Business Class. We both had to send our dried-out, tough and tasteless fish entrees back, and the replacement noodles had all the attributes of a convenience store offering. The toilets, which began the flight having seen better days, were filthy by the end of it, with discarded paper overflowing from the rubbish bin and the floor wet. I will avoid flying Cathay Pacific in future for fear of encountering another flight like this one. It's a shame, because their new Business seat is actually very well thought out, and the touch-screen entertainment system excellent. But for me there's just too much risk of delays, poor food, and encountering the outdated 2-3-2 Business Class cabin to warrant the asking price. Out of our four sectors, push-back from the gate was delayed on three of them by 60, 40 and 50 minutes respectively. I hope we were just unlucky, because these statistics don't make good reading: 75% of our flights delayed by an average of 50 minutes.",A330 series,Business,Business Class,Hong Kong to Singapore,2015-07-01,1.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,1,no,Hong Kong,Singapore,cathay pacific airways

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,1.0,Brian McCaig,2015-07-22,"An A330 which I realise is not new to the CX fleet, but this aircraft was downright grubby. The padding on the seats was non-existant, and the fabric was worn and threadbare. These seats were unacceptable, and for an 8 hour flight, especially so. The cabin looked dingy and in need of a good clean. The cabin staff were are jaded as the furnishings. No sooner had we left the ground, than everyone was ordered - and I mean ordered - to close their window blinds, and they had to remain closed for the duration of the flight. So much for having a window seat. At one point, while going to the washroom, I literally had to jump out of the way of one of the cabin staff who was heading in the opposite direction, and I never received so much as a ""thanks"" as he barged past. The meals were served with all the enthusiasm of a billionaire serving in a soup kitchen - thankfully it was all over quickly. The food itself was ok - passable for economy class. Overall, this was grim. I'm seriously trying to decide whether to give up on Cathay Pacific after this. It's a shame - this used to be a great airline to fly with, but now it seems they're only interested if you travel in one of the premium cabins (I'm speaking from experience).

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,8.0,Neal Postma,2015-07-04,"Overall a great airline. The check-in process is my only complaint after may years of flying with them. I carry an instrument with me when I fly that is oversized. It fits in the overhead bins and does not take up more room in the end than your average suitcase but the dimensions are odd. The last time I flew the check-in staff said there was absolutely no way I could bring it on board. We argued back and forth, got managers involved, threatened to change our flights. Eventually we got approval. A previous time I flew Cathay I booked my ticket at the last minute due to a medical emergency with my wife. I had a 50 minute layover in Tokyo, but that was the best I could do. I went to the airport the night before to try and be put on standby on a flight that evening so I would certainly make my connection. I have never been treated so poorly. Nobody would listen to what was going on. Everyone just said no and walked away. Turns out the flight was not even full, they were just not willing to help. The flights are wonderful however. The planes are well-maintained and seats are comfortable. Staff are quite attentive and friendly. The food was decent for airplane food. In-flight entertainment was as good as any I have experienced.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,8.0,R Golledge,2015-06-28,"I had high expectations for this return flight to Melbourne based on previous reviews and for the most part Cathay didn't disappoint. I really liked the seat space and privacy. The Boeing 777 version is better than the A330 because the seat storage unit is bigger and the bed position felt wider and softer. I liked it better than BA's business class seat - especially when travelling solo. The catering was a bit hit and miss. The chilli prawns and rice out of London were excellent but a Western style chicken dish from Hong Kong was bland. In general, I think they create better Asian dishes. I've not experienced a business class meal service from a trolley before, and I'm not sure I like it. What I did find odd is that they never provided salt and pepper to season the meal. As a pre dinner drink I enjoyed trying a couple of their signature cocktails (different option on different routes). Boarding was easy, once you found the right line. The lounges in Hong Kong were good but busy. I especially liked the shower facilities and the made-to-order catering. But signage for the lounges was dire, so I struggled to find the one I was looking for at times. The lounges in London and Melbourne are also very small with no views, so I found them quite boring. Of my 4 flights, only 1 actually left on time, which was poor. The choice of inflight entertainment was a bit limited but the screen size was good (although it wasn't possible to tilt the screen for a better viewing angle). The staff were quick to respond to any requests. However, they tended to do things by rote. Once I was asked if I'd like more cashews, but that kind of spontaneity was mostly absent. But they were all very pleasant and welcoming.",Boeing 777-300,Solo Leisure,Business Class,LHR to MEL via HKG,2015-06-01,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4,yes,LHR,MEL ,cathay pacific airways

This review will be based on the flight from San Francisco to Hong Kong, since that was a long 15 hour flight. The airline's in-flight entertainment was new, but it was a 7 inch touchscreen, much smaller than the screen of my iPad. Singapore Airlines economy seats offer a 10 inch screen and also a handheld 3-4 inch touchscreen controller. There was also a USB port to charge hand phones or tablets. However, the seats don't include an A/C port or an additional USB port. The seat was newly designed with this adjustable head rest.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,7.0,J Rose,2015-06-14,"Cathay is generally very good all around and this trip was down a notch or two for a few reasons : food quality was not up to standard out of LHR  or NRT, though not as bad out of HKG. On HKG-LHR leg though they did not have enough mid-flight meals for all passengers, which I find hard to fathom given people are paying thousands for the ticket and the meal only costs Cathay a few quid to produce. They should overstock, not understock the flight. The other complaint on the trip was the regionally configured plane from NRT-HKG is a poor excuse for business class on a four hour leg. No reason not to run flat beds on that route, considering the importance of it and the fact that some flights are overnight. Won't pay for that again.

"""It was a fantastic flight""",9.0,J Tung,2020-06-27,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Taipei during the pandemic. EVA only sells full fare ticket during this period so my tickets cost double of the usual price. However this is totally understandable, and I was able to select my seat once the ticket is booked. Check in at Heathrow was bit chaotic but this was due to the airport organisation to ensure social distance (which in my opinion only creates more queue than distance). EVA has requested some forms to be filled prior to checking in and also Taiwanese government requires online registration so they can monitor each single arriving passenger. The queue to reach check in took around 90 minutes. Once check in was performed it was very smooth to go through security. After security the only shops opened were Boots and WH Smith. Boarding was in good order. EVA enforced boarding zones to reduce congestion. Temperature of all passengers were taken and recorded. The crew members were in full PPE (goggles, facial mask, glove and apron) but still welcome passengers with a warm smile. The plane is a 3 year old B777-300 but it was spotless. EVA planes are perhaps the cleanest among all but it's evident that special cleaning had been implemented during this period. Most of the Taiwanese passenger also wore personal PPE and everyone was wiping their seat/table/screen once onboard. The flight pushed back some 30 minutes behind schedule due to delay on ground service. We were given amenity kits, blanket and a bottle of water while we wait on the ground. We were served two hot meals throughout the flight - one dinner and one breakfast. Both meals were tasty. They also announced few times that food and drink service was altered to meet additional hygiene standard. Toilets on the plane was kept spotless through the journey in a typical EVA fashion. Choices of movie/TV was limited. This has never been the strong point of EVA and perhaps during this tough time for aviation this has been cut back further. However I was still able to find some movie and TV programs to keep me occupied when I wasn't sleepy. The 13 hour flight passed quick and it was a very quiet 13 hours. All passenger wore their mask throughout. The flight landed in Taipei 20 minutes later than schedule but it only took me less than 30 minutes to leave the airport - that included buying a new SIM card, finishing the health screen registration, passing immigration and collecting luggage. The luggage was also disinfected before they reached the belt. It was a fantastic flight - very calm and relaxing despite the various measures enforced. The cleanness of the plane and the strict service procedure was reassuring.",Boeing 777,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,London to Taipei,2020-06-01,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4,yes,London,Taipei,eva air

"""Overall a pleasant flight""",7.0,J Tung,2019-10-15,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flew from LHR to BKK return last week on premium economy. Overall a pleasant flight and will definitely recommend it again. Of course it's not as good as their business class but it represents great value. Check in at both Heathrow and Bangkok were super efficient. At Bangkok despite there being multiple flights leaving at the same time to Europe and Taipei, the check in lanes for business and premium economy were empty and the check in process took less than 5 minutes. This is far superior than most of the European business class check in experience (BA/Air France and KLM in particular). Flights took off on time and landed ahead of schedule. The seat itself was very comfortable - I found the seat to be more spacious than those on Cathay Pacific. Service on the outbound flight was efficient and standard but on the way back the crew was very friendly and professional. The plane was clean, food was tasty and the crew walked around the cabin few times offering water and food post main meal. There is never a long queue for the toilet. The big let down with EVA is the limited choice of movie/TV programme. I was lucky I found a Taiwanese TV drama that I wanted to watch otherwise you'd better preload your ipad with Netflix or BBC Iplayer. There was also an incident when we landed in Bangkok. Due to heavy thunder and rain the airport ground service was suspended but no information was given. Had to wait for 2 hours for the luggage to come out. Compared with my last EVA premium economy flight (2 years ago), I personally feel that sadly the service has declined - although it's still above most of the airlines premium economy.

The quality of the service and food on both my flights was fantastic. The cabin crew in Business Class are very attentive and quickly are at your seat as soon as your glass or plate is empty with another drink or meal course. As someone who works in the aviation industry I am all too familiar with the intricacies of an airline from front-line to behind-the-scenes. All four of my flights departed on time and when faced with a difficult situation (arriving 35 minutes prior to departure due to an airport-access issue) the ground staff were accommodating and whisked me through security. Surprisingly my baggage also made the flight which was something I was concerned with. If I had to find a negative it would unfortunately be the Plaza Premium lounge EVA Air uses in Toronto.

I selected the filet mignon and it was superb. The service was exceptional and the flight attendant addressed me by name. She was very pleasant and friendly though sometimes I had a little hard time understanding her English. We managed and everything went well.

"""Service was flawless""",10.0,Rafael Suarez,2019-09-21,"✅ Trip Verified |  Taipei to Houston. This was my home leg on a trip that started in Jakarta. Once landing in Taipei, only had less than one hour to make the transfer to the Houston flight so I was trying to walk as fast as I could. As is always the case our arrival gate was way way down from the transfer area, I thought it was a mile walk. As I approached the transfer area there were two employees of EVA Air announcing the Houston flight and I said I was going there, then they asked my name and I told them and to my surprise they handed me a new boarding pass that upgraded me to Premium Economy on the Taipei Houston flight. I was dumbfounded bue very appreciative of this gesture by EVA Air. I managed the transfer i and arrived at the airplane like 15 minutes before departure. Having tried the premium economy product before, I proceeded to settle on my seat for the long flight home. Shortly after take off we were served our dinner. The PM product has one additional serving of food, akin to an appetizer. All the food served was very good tasty and proper temperature, cold when needed to be cold and hot was needed to be hot. Service was flawless as it always has been for me with EVA. Shortly  after I slept for a while and missed the snack and then proceeded to watch movies and listen to music until landing. The second meal was also on point and I arrived rested and well fed in Houston. All in all this was my 6th trip with EVA and my 24th flight with them in 3 years and I have never been disappointed.

"""flight attendants just disappeared""",7.0,Steven Tu,2019-06-23,"✅ Trip Verified | Chicago to Taipei. While EVA deserves its reputation as a top airline, my most recent experience with EVA was not my best. During my 6/2019 flight from ORD to TPE, I had to call for a Flight Attendant 3 times for a beverage before an attendant came over. The flight attendants just disappeared after the first meal, that often happens on USA airlines, but I have never experienced that on EVA before. Another note: the plane was just a bit too warm to sleep well. I have requested to lower the temp on other EVA flights and usually, FAs do lower it a bit, but this time, my fault, I just too dispirited to ask, and I will dress more lightly on the return. My TPE to ORD return trip this week was canceled due to the ongoing EVA flight attendant strike that began 6-20-19. After I received email notification my return flight was canceled, I waited in a queue overnight at TPE airport 10 hours trying to rebook, I was #1131 of 1375. I was grateful EVA kept the ticketing desk open all night for those of us who were waiting, however, the six EVA agents stationed in front of the queue doing nothing productive but chatting with each other could have been better utilized at the ticket desk assisting customers to find alternative flights and lessening the waiting time. After 10 hours of waiting, I was assisted and offered different options for my return flight to the US. The agents were mostly helpful but seemed annoyed when I refused their initial offer of return flights with no seat assignment or were a lesser booking class than my original ticket. In the end, EVA agents were able to rebook/reroute me on a return flight with one stop. I will likely continue to fly EVA routes when there is a choice, however, given my experience with EVA this time, when I next book a flight, I will look at all flights options instead of EVA first.",Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Chicago to Taipei,2019-06-01,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3,yes,Chicago,Taipei,eva air

"""seamless five star experience""",10.0,W. Robert Kmen,2018-05-27,"✅ Trip Verified |  This trip from Hong Kong to Toronto was a seamless five star experience. Check-in at HKG terminal one was instantaneous and my suitcase was tagged through to Tampa. The priority security line took perhaps two minutes and immigration was equally quick. The Star Gold lounge closest to our departure gate was the United Club, which was satisfactory. Boarding was disciplined and business class passengers were shown to their seats and greeted by name. We were immediately offered sparkling wine or juice and received the menu and wine list for the short flight to Taipei. The full meal was served on HKG-TPE; I chose the sweet and sour pork, and it was excellent. Once airborne, a good champagne ( DeLamotte Blanc de Blancs ) replaced the sparkling wine. In hindsight, I indulged myself too much in the lounge and on the short flight so that I was not able to really appreciate the headline long-haul flight TPE to YYZ. On that flight, they served Veuve Clicquot La Grande Dame, but I was only able to sample half a glass. I also short circuited the eight course dinner meal and skipped straight to the fruit plate. The flight attendants could not have been more eager to serve and please. They addressed passengers by name throughout the flight and did their best to anticipate any request. The seats on EVA's 777-300's are arranged in a 1-2-1 pattern and are wide and comfortable. However, passengers who choose window seats to enjoy looking out may be disappointed because you are seated a good distance from the window.

Given that at the time that I bought the ticket, which was about two days before the flight and the fact that the additional cost to upgrade to Premium Economy was minimal, I think it was a good deal. The seat is wider than economy and the meal service a bit upgraded as are the pillows, the blanket and the amenities kit but in all honesty for me if the price difference is big, like double economy, I would not fly it. On this airline the economy product is great and really in my previous two trips I had no complaints on the service whatsoever.

EVA Air boards by groups and they have the process very well defined as there was no crowding on to the boarding area because the lines queued pretty far from the gate agent. Once in the airplane the flight attendants all very friendly and efficient to make sure we make it to our assigned seats. This was to be a 16.30 flight to Taipei.

"""good value for money""",7.0,M Clark,2018-04-01,"✅ Trip Verified | This was my second time flying EVA Air (return flight from Cebu to Vancouver via Taipei). I wrote an earlier review of my Vancouver to Cebu flight. Check-In - Quick and painless. Paid online for window seats through Flight Hub when I bought the return ticket in the fall but that was not honored by EVA. Was told that there is no such paid pre-flight seat selection arrangement between EVA and Flight Hub. Grrr! I griped about that in my previous review. Settled for an aisle seat. The check-in staff were efficient and courteous. Flight to Taipei - The plane was a gleaming A321 with the Hello Kitty livery. I thought that was cool as it added to the festive atmosphere inside the plane that was packed with returning tourists. Meals and IFE were identical to my previous Taipei to Cebu flight. The cabin service was fine but a notch below that of the longer Taipei to Vancouver leg. I suspect EVA uses less experienced flight attendants for the shorter flights within the ASEAN region. Flight to Vancouver - The screening of passengers from the waiting lounge to the actual boarding area one floor down left a sour taste in my mouth. I witnessed how a stern-looking young lady, possibly in her mid 20s, was berating a middle-aged Asian couple for supposedly ""not having the right documents"" to travel to Canada. A big part of the problem was communication as English was a second language to both parties. How I wished the EVA staff was more professional. Instead of being overbearing and raising her voice in the hope of getting her point across, she should have discreetly pulled the couple aside and then asked another staff, possibly with better communication skills and more empathy than her, to sort the matter with the passengers, who were visibly humiliated in front of so many passengers in the queue. Incidents like this make me really angry. The flight back was excellent. New Boeing 777-300ER. Decent warm meals albeit with minuscule serving of drinks. Five-star IFE. Skilled and attentive flight attendants. (I mentioned in my first review that they needed to hone their soft skills though.) The only negative was the inability of the flight attendants to handle some of the passengers, who were part of a tour group. During boarding, some of them were in near stampede to get available overhead bins as others barked instructions to members of their group. Others were completely oblivious to their invading the personal space of other passengers while lining up for the washroom. I was seated at 69C which was three rows from the last row in the rear. Beware of that aisle seat. It did not have a restful 10-hour flight given the constant flux and occasional chatter of people going to the washrooms. In spite of the negatives some of which were beyond the airline's control, EVA represents a good value for the money.

I did an internet search and was pleasantly surprised to know that EVA has a 5-star rating. That set the tenor of my expectation when I flew in early January 2018. Arrived at YVR airport 4 hours prior to my flight and the lineup was already building up at the counter assigned to EVA. I waited only 20 minutes from the time the staff started the check-in process. I paid for window seats when I bought my return ticket from Flight Hub only to be told that EVA does not honour such arrangement with Flight Hub. The staff told me that this was an ongoing problem. (It is incredibly hard dealing with Flight Hub and getting back what I paid for the window seats for the 4 sectors.)  My main carry-on was 7 kg. I thought my smaller bag with my laptop, tablet, chargers, etc. would be okay given what the online baggage guidelines say. Was wrong and asked to transfer some of my stuff to one of my checked-ins, which was below the limit. In fairness to EVA, the staff were very courteous. Boarding was organized and uneventful. The flight was fully booked. The Boeing 777-ER300 was either brand new or newly refitted. I was assigned to a middle seat next (46J) to the emergency exit. Acres of legroom but no overhead bin for my bags. The meals were decent but drinks were consistently served in minuscule volume compared to what I am used to with North American airlines. The washrooms must have been cleaned and restocked at least twice during the 13-hour flight to Taipei.  In-flight entertainment was top notch featuring the latest Hollywood offerings. 5 stars! In-flight service would have given 5 stars too but I cannot. The cabin staff were efficient albeit in a cold manner. They need to beef up their soft skills and learn the art of making passengers feel genuinely welcome.  Smile and say welcome in a way that jives with your non-verbal cues. Gently take the bag of someone who is struggling to find space in the overhead bin instead of brusquely grabbing the bag without saying anything or making eye contact to assure the passenger you are there to help. Transit in Taipei was smooth and quick. We changed to an A321 for the flight to Cebu. The boarding gate was changed the last minute. I had difficulty understanding the instructions over the PA.

Plane was clean and comfortable and in good condition. We waited over an hour on the tarmac before taking off from Taipei, seemingly due to heavy traffic at the airport, but the crew gave little information about this, which was a little frustrating.

Check-in at Heathrow was effortless, the Air Canada lounge in terminal 2 was lovely and tranquil (I think that had much to do with the late evening departure of my flight) and boarding was equally as easy. The food on EVA is not as good, in my experience, as that of Emirates or Qatar, but the crew seemed to be endlessly on-hand (not disappearing mid-flight as with some carriers) with drinks and the offer of snacks.

On this particular flight, legroom was not an issue for me at all and even the width of the seat was plenty for me. Being a new plane we had the wide(r) touch-screen entertainment system and the selection of movies and television shows was adequate. Even tried out a couple of the games and they were entertaining enough to pass some time. Food was hit-and-miss. On the flight to Toronto they served a pesto chicken pasta that was actually really delicious. Other meals were good or just okay. There was always something on the tray to my liking though. Service was good as well, no issues to report. The best part is that I was comfortable enough to sleep the majority of the 15+ hour flight. Comparatively, the next leg was on a much older plane (also EVA) and the comfort of the seats and the age of the entertainment system certainly fell compared to the flight prior.

But this latest sector was I believe a new aircraft with newly designed flimsy seats. I’m average height and build and I just pity any taller travellers or those carrying a few extra pounds. I have never been so uncomfortable on a flight in my life. The seat base was so hard my legs were literally numb 3 or 4 hours into the flight. We had to ask for extra blankets to provide at least a bearable level of padding and so did other passengers around us. Once the seat in front was reclined you could forget getting anything from the bag under your seat. In preparation for our return flight we have bought inflatable cushions. Inflight entertainment is below average, old films and very little else. Cabin service is also average, food was OK and attendants friendly, but a tiny cup full of wine was offered with dinner with a top up if you could catch the offer as it flew past on the trolley. That we could live with, but I don’t recall any soft drinks being offered through the night although there was a tray of drinks in the galley if you could manage to prise yourself out of your tiny seat which wasn’t ever going to be more than once or twice due to the unavoidable disturbance caused to passengers around you.

The seat was the most comfortable I have experienced for sleep - wider and lie flat surface longer than any other so far. The pillow was plush and large and the blanket thick and warm. PJs and a thin mattress also available if desired. I had no trouble sleeping well on our over night flight, despite lots of turbulence. The food service included dinner and a breakfast just before arrival. I chose Chinese style cuisine for both and they were delicious. Food presentation was excellent. EVA paid attention to little details, for example, chopstick and spoon holders were an elegant touch. The young ladies / FA did amazing job. They worked super hard and served with a smile despite same shift for 14 hours. The amenity kit was placed in a Rimowa silver container - very nice.

Hoping to get an exit row seat, I asked the agent at the beginning of the line about this possibility. He asked me if I had checked in on-line yet. I said that I tried but I wasn't successful. He asked me to try again, and then head directly to the online check-in bag drop to change the seat. This worked exactly as promised! At the gate area, EVA had free coffee & tea ready for those who wanted it. They boarded a full 747-400 30 minutes prior to departure. The young female flight attendants were very friendly. EVA's seats are really comfortable. The food is excellent. They had fish curry with steamed rice and hot rolls. I actually slept on this plane which is a rarity.

"""definitely recommend EVA""",9.0,J Michaels,2017-04-27,"✅ Verified Review | On my first flight from Manila to Taipei the agent at the counter in Manila was kind enough to upgrade me to premium economy at no cost. During my second flight from Manila to New York JFK I was in the regular economy cabin. Being this my first experience with EVA I was not sure what to expect but I booked because their 5 star rating here. During my first flight (Manila to Taipei - 2hrs) I received a hot meal (rice, meat, and vegetables), fresh fruit, a hot roll with butter, cake, wine, juice and water. No US carrier provides a meal like that on a two hour flight unless you are in business class or above. During my second flight (Manila to NYC - 14hrs) I received two hot meals (rice, meat, shrimp, vegetables, and pasta) fresh fruit, hot rolls with butter, dessert, wine, juice, water, snacks and 2 ham and cheese sandwiches. That is what I chose from the menu that we had in economy. Yes they hand you a menu with multiple choices and it's also displayed on the interactive screen you have in front of you. Their interactive entertainment choices are decent however for the 14 hour flight a more ample selection of movies would have been nice. The bathrooms in the economy cabin were equipped with amenities like you find in the business cabin bathrooms. Soap, lotion, body mist, facial mist, toothbrush, and sleeping masks were available in the bathrooms. On your chair you found a very nice and comfortable pillow with a blanket plus over the headphones. Next time I fly EVA I will book the premium economy cabin because the seat is extremely comfortable, double patted and a bit wider. (I'm 180lbs. 5'9"") plus they separate the cabin with curtains giving you the feeling of a less crowded space. The seat in the regular economy cabin was comfortable however any seat that you spend 14 hours on at some point will become uncomfortable and I found myself having to stand multiple times during the flight. I had an aisle seat. My only observation as constructive feedback would be that even though everyone onboard smiled, happiness must appear to be genuine and that genuine feeling was not properly transmitted by the flight attendants. On the other hand I must say that they worked extremely fast, efficiently, and professional. I flew the Boeing 777-300ER for both flights and I have to say that it was not as quiet as the Boeing 787 and both planes while clean had signs of wear and tear. I definitely recommend EVA Air over any US based airline for the economy traveler.

Crew members on both flights were really wonderful, responsive, genuine, good humored and always present in the cabin. We were last to check in so straight to the gate. Once on board felt as if all passengers were treated as special. Food was OK, wine was like first class including La Grande Dame 2006 Champagne. Cabin was old, seats did not go to full bed thus sleep was a little fraught. Transit in TPE brief, went to the lounge for half a drink, the Infinity Lounge looked more like a nightclub, didn't eat anything there seemed to be good variety of food but only wine was a single bottle of red. Next flight seemed to be delayed by connecting passengers, this wasn't explained however also very pleasant despite being ""Business"" rather that ""Royal Laurel"". Large quantity of food for such a short flight, again OK but had repeated ingredients so lacked variety - most simply looked reheated and lacked finesse.

The seating was the older premium economy version which seems much more comfortable than the newer version which does not provide sufficient support for the thigh area.

Bottles of water were provided and the cabin crew frequently came through the cabin offering refills. The lavatories were kept clean and provided a small but welcome range of toiletries such as ear plugs and toothbrushes.

EVA Air is undoubtedly an efficient and well run operation, with pleasant staff at the check-in at BKK through to a tad less pleasant flight attendants. Leg room and seats were more spacious than the average Economy class, though it does look a bit dated. Food was disappointing, though not especially bad. The selection of movies was very mediocre for long haul. Despite everything being perfectly reasonable about the flight, it was one of those horrible flying experiences that left me grasping for sanity. Not really the flight attendants fault, but some particularly poor parenting to the rear of me, saw a toddler terrorize the entire flight by screaming and/or running around the cabin. This was book ended by a newly born infant adding to the cacophony at the front. It really is time to have the option that some airlines offer for long haul, such as Malaysia Airlines, of child free zones, or at very least some kind of quiet zone (or even a family only zone).",Boeing 777-300ER,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to London,2017-02-01,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,4,yes,Bangkok,London,eva air

After I went through TSA I realized I had left my cell phone at the counter, and I frantically ran back to the check-in counter and the check-in staff held it for me. I believe ORD to TPE is a new route and the EVA gate staff still has a few things to work out, boarding was a bit chaotic, even though they called by zones, several people pushed past those of us lined up by zone. On the plane, it was a mostly good 15 hour trip. I believe EVA has improved its catering because both my meal choices were terrific — the chicken with rice dinner was delicious and the morning breakfast scrambled eggs and bacon was amazing — it seems to be tough for any airline to do eggs well, but EVA got it right. A plus is that we were served with silverware and that elevated the experience. Unfortunately, throughout the 15 hours the cabin was just too warm. I asked the passenger seated at the aisle near me if he felt warm and he agreed it was hot (and he was wearing shorts). I asked the FA if she was able to lower the temperature a bit, and 20 minutes later, it was not as warm, but the temperature in the cabin never approached comfortable and I could not sleep during the flight. The odd part is I walked back through the Economy section a few times during the flight to stretch my legs and those cabins were so much cooler and almost everyone was asleep. The FA for my section seemed a bit distracted and forgot to bring my drink order even after the person next to me was served drink orders twice.

The flight itself was around 85% full in Elite class. There was a bottle of water on the seat as well as ear phone and amenity pack and slippers - a typical EVA standard for Elite class. Menu was distributed after boarding. The two cabin crew in charge of the Elite class were probably the most professional crew I've encountered. They were friendly, smiley, efficient and enthusiastic. The Thai and Taiwanese Crew worked well as a team. I even think the service was one step above my favorite SQ.

I checked in online 24 hours before departure and dropped my luggage at Heathrow. There is never a queue for Elite class passengers which is a plus. Boarding was on time. The plane was 8 years old and has just been refurbished - new seats for Elite class as well as new entertainment system. Personally I think the entertainment system is decent - the screen is large with good resolution, but the programme is limited, and the flight map is not interactive.  I prefer the old seat as it felt more comfortable. However the advantage of the new seat is that the chunky entertainment box has now been removed. They have upgraded the amenity pack but it was just the packing that is changed. Service on this flight was the biggest disappointment.

"""flight itself was lovely""",6.0,M Edwards,2016-11-16,"✅ Verified Review | London to Taipei via Bangkok with EVA Air. I have mixed feelings about this trip; I cannot fault the actual flight itself, because it was genuinely wonderful, but there were some issues with all other parts of the trip. During booking, for example: I only realised that there would be a stopover in Bangkok after I'd paid for the ticket (the flight was advertised as 'direct to Taipei' with no mention of the fact that there would be a 40 min technical stop). Technically correct, yes, but I wish the EVA Air website had made it clearer during booking. It was also very difficult to find out whether or not we would need to change plane. Boarding at Heathrow: my first time at Terminal 2, it seemed rather hectic. I have the EVA Air app on my phone and had my boarding pass on there, but 3 hours before going to the airport, the QR code disappeared from the app, so I needed to do check-in again to obtain a paper boarding pass. No directions were given during the technical stop/transfer in Bangkok - I just followed a couple whom I heard speaking Chinese - needed to go through security again, but otherwise no problems, BKK airport was lovely, free WiFi. Final issue: I somehow managed to earn 0 miles on this trip, even though there was nothing particularly 'saver' about my booking (sometimes the inflexible, cheaper bookings are not given very many air miles, but even then 25% is the minimum I should have expected). The flight itself was lovely - comfortable seat in economy, the food was delicious (we were given a menu, and the alcohol selection was great), cabin crew incredibly polite and friendly, everything (even the bathrooms) very clean, in-flight WiFi (a bit expensive, but works well - it cut out for about 2-3 hours while we were flying over India, though), good entertainment system.

"""business class product is great""",7.0,V Blaxell,2016-10-18,"✅ Verified Review |  Singapore to Taipei. EVA Air's hard business class product is great. I love the reverse herringbone seat layout of 1-2-1 which means that my window seat was angled toward the windows so I could look out with getting a neck ache. The seat is fully flat, highly adjustable, and really enormously comfortable although the footwell area for fully flat is a tad confined and the seat itself is quite narrow. There is quite a lot of storage space but none of it very useful since one is not permitted to stow anything in it for take off and landing, and there is no floor level storage for the carry-on, unlike the Singapore Airlines business class product which allows me to put my quite big carry on in an alcove near my feet. The color scheme is very nice, and the whole finish is excellent. As for the soft product: not so much. The FAs were attentive but their English and Japanese language skills were really limited. They were not proactive when it came to service. I had ordered the main course online and since the appetizer looked great and tasted even better, was looking forward to it, in as much as one can look forward to airline food. When the FA brought my main, it was ghastly. I left my fork standing up in the mess, and you know, the FA came by to refill my wine several times and never once inquired about the main course which sat there the whole time. I could have asked her to take it away and bring something else, but I thought I'd see how long it went on. Nothing happened. After a while she came and took it away and replaced it with a dessert selection which was as good as the appetizer.

"""I was expecting more""",6.0,Jacinto Dimailig,2016-08-30,"✅ Verified Review |  
For the first time, my wife and I flew with EVA Air from Toronto to Manila via Taipei. Checking in at YVR, there was a long queue but I was relieved to find that there was a separate lane for Premium Economy passengers thus check in didn't take that long. The flight was fully booked, however, the staff who checked us in was able to arrange for my wife and I to be seated next to each other. The flight departed on time, and about and hour and a half later dinner was served. Having flown Premium Economy previously with fellow Star Alliance member carriers Air Canada and Turkish Airlines, I was expecting more from EVA or at least something similar to what AC and TK have. That EVA serves meals to its Premium Economy passengers using plastic utensils was a letdown to begin with. While the meals maybe considered satisfactory, drinks were served in child-sized plastic cups including the wine which for some may be somewhat unappealing. Overall the impression I got was that there was no real difference between Premium Economy and Economy except for the extra leg and shoulder space. Choice of movies wasn't that up to date.

In brief: great value for money. Checking in in Amsterdam is a well-run operation, check in counters open three hours in advance. On-line check-in is easy and fast, and then it is just a matter of dropping the bag at the Royal Laurel counter. The Aspire lounge for EVA AIR passengers (shared with a number of airlines) is excellent - and now that renovation at Schiphol is progressing, also better accessible; however, it is quite a distance from the usual EVA Air Gate G5. Boarding is orderly, and after the preliminaries (champagne, amenity kit, cold towel) the plane took off on time. Inflight service is great - staff anticipate your needs, catering quality high level (including the option to choose your meal in advance - which I did, and I enjoyed a delicious lobster thermidor). Strikingly, all cabin staff is female, and they are well trained. Friendly, service oriented and confident. The staff regularly checks for passengers' needs.

The cabin staff were all truly lovely and cared about our comfort. I preordered my meal online and was impressed with the service. The food was beautifully presented. As far as the complaints about the food, I would disagree. It's still plane food and I though everything was fine. The seat pod was very comfortable and felt very private. It took a little while to get myself organized in the space, since there was a lot of nooks and crannies in which to store your things. After playing with the many seat buttons, you are really able to put the seat in any position to get comfortable. The entertainment system was very good with the noise canceling headphones. There was an extensive selection of current movies of all genres. Mood lighting from pink to purple to twinkling stars help set the mood for sleep. I always used the forward bathroom for which there was never a wait. Bathrooms were immaculate any time I went in. I enjoyed the Rimowa kit, PJ's, and slippers. I was able to sleep a solid 5 hours and I'm sure I dozed from time to time as well. I loved seeing the plane travel route with the current time of LAX, duration left of the flight and time at destination. Arrived Taipei where I was really able to refresh in the lounge. A 2 hour layover and the a 4.5 hr trip to Singapore. I flew back with EVA Air on 5/12 from Shanghai to Taipei to LAX; Flights BR711, BR12. Another fabulous experience. I actually looked forward to the trip home. Best thing was I didn't experience jet lag either way! Totally amazing. Probably my only criticism would be the way the boarding process is handled. Although there are separate zones for business vs economy, I still felt it was pretty much a cattle call since everyone is lining up in their labeled zones. Felt a little like flying SouthWest.

Shortly after take off came the hors-d'oeuvres, accompanied with a glass of Krug Grandcuvee (Eva is famous for offering good quality bubbly in Business Class). The beefnoodle soup with accompanying condiments, vegetables and scallop was exquisite, and a taste of Taiwan. Bottles of water were offered and left next to the galley. Also available throughout the flight were assorted fruits, snacks (biscuits, chocolates, nuts and dried fruits! I had a great sleep, the crew had told me about the possibility of making a bed if I wanted to sleep, but I did not do this. Shortly after I woke up, a flight attendant asked if I wanted a snack. I ordered a burger, which came with potato wedges. Breakfast was a full meal, and I had ordered traditional Taiwanese congee with a variety of side dishes.  I also recommend their selection of Taiwanese oolong and teas. The washroom was very clean. The toiletries are Harnn. The crew were welcoming, warm and paid attention to detail.

Films and music could be better. The food is never great on EVA and you are made to feel like you are begging for alcoholic beverages. The main issue tho is the quality of some passengers, maybe down to recent competitive prices. Noisy and rude, talking all night and opening blinds during sleep hours. The stewardesses for some reason will never ask these disruptive passengers to be quiet or close the blinds, so we all suffer light in the cabin/lack of sleep.

From the moment I checked in to arrival in Amsterdam I cannot fault one thing. Every single member of staff was immensely helpful (and caring about my dog travelling with me). The aircraft interior was modern and spotless, the cabin crew smiling and helpful and the food served was without doubt the best economy class meals I've ever tasted - and generous portions too. IFE had a pretty limited film choice although the screen was quite large and legroom was generous plus only 9 abreast seating on 777.

"""cheerful, efficient and eager""",8.0,Steven Tu,2016-01-02,"Another mostly positive experience on EVA. For the 13 hour flight from Los Angeles to Taipei, if it is in your budget, it is worth to fly premium economy (EVA calls it Elite Class). We appreciated the bottle of water, newspapers, and small amenity kit (toothbrush, toothpaste, lip balm). I noticed a few upgrades since we flew EVA this past summer - larger entertainment screens (pretty much ipad-like), reduced size of entertainment boxes giving us more room to stretch our legs out. Good power options and USB port to watch your own shows. Wireless was available for a fee. The foot rest is still virtually unusable.  What I like most about EVA is that the flight attendants seemed to be assigned to a specific section - the attendant for our section was cheerful, efficient and seemed eager to help make the flight go more smoothly. She remembered my drink preferences and explained menu choices patiently in excellent English. I appreciated how quickly she collected our trays after the meal service. I usually fall asleep during the 13 hour fight but the cabin was warmer than I would prefer and I wish now that I had asked them to turn it down, instead I just hydrated myself. The flight was smooth, takeoff and landing, although we ran into headwinds that affected our air route. The pilot let us know this added 30-40 minutes to our flight. I used the restroom once and it was fairly clean, not spotless as on previous trips, but definitely looked after. The meals served on this flight were ok, the bread was hard/cold and the entrees, Chinese porridge, and chicken with rice, while filling, were not especially appetizing. EVA can update their meal variety. Also, EVA used to offer cups of hot ramen noodles as a snack, but not on this flight (I miss that), though they did offer small sandwiches and crackers, and the attendants came around often with tea, water or coffee. During the LAX check-in process, the attendant assisting us at EVA's front desk seemed bothered when I asked about the possibility of changing our two middle seats to middle/aisle for the return flight. “Ask in Taipei,” he brusquely replied, giving us back our passports/tickets and directing us away from the check-in counter. We visit Taipei often to stay with family and have chosen EVA 8 times - for our next trip, in summer 2016, I want to look around at other options before we book EVA. EVA is definitely one of the better flight experiences to be had.

Meal service is provided at a good pace. I pre-ordered my meals via the Eva app but the food was overcooked and tasteless and breakfast equally poor. Large video screen with fair selection of movies.

The transfers at TPE were efficient and clear. The quality of food was excellent. On the TPE-YVR it was a treat to be served two hot meals.

"""EVA Air is a great airline """,8.0,S Nelson,2015-12-04,"Singapore to San Francisco via Taipei, my fifth time on EVA Air, once was in Royal Laurel class and that was outstanding. The rest have been in economy.  In terms of cabin comfort. I prefer EVA Air over Singapore. EVA's economy has an extra inch of legroom and being 6'2"" tall, every extra inch of space matters to me. Cabin service on EVA Air is very attentive and the flight attendants are quite pleasant and kept the plane as well as the restrooms, spotless. My only two complaints, and then only on these last two flight legs from Singapore to Taipei and Taipei to San Francisco deal with the food and the entertainment. Both my wife and I pre-ordered the seafood special meal for each of the flight segments. Each meal was essentially the same with pan-fried fish (though the fish did vary) and pasta noodles. Seafood meals on previous flights have included shrimp and scallops, so we were disappointed this time. The second complaint is with the IFE system, specifically the lack of selections. Now this may be more an indictment of Hollywood than EVA Air, but I found nothing to watch in either direction of this trip. (We left SFO in November and returned in December, so the movies changed). 14 to 16 hours on a plane is a long time with nothing to watch.

Easy process. Reservation office is manned during office hour and calls answered within 5 minutes. Check in and boarding at Heathrow Terminal 2 was smooth without any hassle. T2 was relatively quiet in late evening. EVA Air flight departs from the Satellite at T2 which is a long walk, so don't leave it to last minute. Plane was a 7 or8 year old Boeing 777-300. Nothing fancy but good leg room and clean (but warm) cabin. Amenity kits, bottled water and high quality blanket were provided upon boarding along with a menu. Dinner service started 1 hour into flight. Food was tasty and drinks were available. Not the best wine choice but it's sufficient. Ice cream was provided. Service was efficient although a bit robotic. Toilets were kept clean throughout the flight and the crew walked along with plenty of water and sandwich. Short stopover at BKK then continued to TPE. Disappointed that the flight map wasn't working properly so we had no update where we were. Return flight TPE to BKK was a 4 hour journey. Again service was efficient. Check in at TPE terminal 2 was very slow though. The airport simply couldn't cope. A week later Bangkok to London with the same equipment and service, with much better check in/bag drop experience in BKK airport (I used online check in which was easy). One of the weakness of EVA Air is the dated product and the poor entrainment system compared with SQ or CX. They are buying new Boeing 777 with new interior, wifi and better screen but not sure if the old stock will get renovated.

They accommodated special requests readily and English was universally spoken, smiles all around. The seat pitch on both 777 and 747 seemed better than most economy classes, I slept well. Slippers were provided. On the 747 upper deck window seats, storage lockers between the seat and fuselage are a nice convenience. Food was good to excellent, served with very firm and usable plastic cutlery. The ginger fish and pork and rice were the most memorable dishes. The only disappointment was the in-seat technology. No charging available, the entertainment system screen was smallish, felt very 2005. Movies and TV on the system would inexplicably cut out sometimes. The flight tracker played a loop of views showing the total fight path, then current location, etc, rather than being controlled by the user to see what you want.

"""there were a few passengers moving around the cabin without having a mask on""",6.0,Jonsen Sinaga,2021-05-29,"✅ Trip Verified | Overjoyed about the chance to fly GA in their A330-900neo (DPS-CGK), few days prior to departure however, the aircraft is changed into B777-300-ER. Check in at GA flight business class always done at its class, a dedicated check in lounge. One concern on flight GA088 to AMS was, there were a few passengers moving around the cabin without having a mask on. What I found worse was when the cabin crews walked past those passengers and did not notice and did not give any warning. Once I thought perhaps those passengers just forgot to have their mask on, but no. Afterwards, I went to the in-charge crews in business class with an angry voice, to address my concern as to why they let such things happen in corona times. Although all GA cabin crews are vaccinated against Covid-19, they must have been more alert with the onboard situation like on any other airlines I have flown with. It makes me wonder, is it the lack of English of the crews or just an ignorance? I have written a few good reviews about GA flights, but not this time. They announced that all passengers must sit according to seat number on the boarding pass, but this is yet another issue. I had to sit in one seat far away from my travel companion because of the social distancing, but when one asked to move seat to the empty seat between us, it was allowed by the crew. IFE on GA flights are still below average, kindly do an upgrade.

Meals served as always, course by course as if you are experiencing an A'la Carte dining. Unlike other airlines that decided to serve their meals in a box and cut services from usual, but not in GA. Covid-19 measurement is nicely done, all crews wearing mask and hand gloves. There is no unnecessary attributes. Business class lavatories are huge in comparison with KLM's I flew weeks ago. Seats comes in 1-2-1 configurations while many airlines are still on 2-2-2 or even 2-3-2. Social distance is well practiced on board which is the most important case nowadays.

"""enjoy their high level of service""",9.0,Ronny Adriansyah,2021-02-05,"✅ Trip Verified |  Denpasar Bali to Bandung on 10 January 2021 as part of family trip to SE Asia. A new government requirement of a 2x24 hours validity Rapid Antigen test or 3x24 hours validity PCR test before flying forced us to get a RA test the day before. We have to validate the test results prior to check in and shows the validated documents at Garuda check in desk. We shopped a lot in Bali so we were overweight more than the allowance (44 lbs/20 kg per person) and have to pay for excess baggage at another booth, but then all our luggage were tagged as priority due to the excess baggage payment. The aircraft for this trip is a 10 year old B738 (PK-GFA) that is still in good shape. Boarding was done a few minutes early than expected, with Business Class passengers boarding first and then all Economy passengers. The airplane was clean but we still use our Clorox wipes to clean the tray table, armrest, seatbelts and screen when we got to our seat. The seats are spacious, legroom more than enough and the entertainment screen and its content is very decent for this 1.5 hours flight. We used the provided 2-prong headphones, since our wireless transmitter that connects to bluetooth headset is using a single 3.5"" jack. We were given a snack box with pastries and granola bar for this short flight, and drinks from the drink cart. Just like the Garuda flight a few days before, the FAs in this flight were very courteous, polite, helpful and cheerful when attending to their passengers. GA still have the best FA compared to other airlines in the world! Our flight left a few minutes ahead of schedule and we arrived around 32 minutes ahead of schedule. Our luggage, having the priority tags, were among the first ones being unloaded from the aircraft to the Business Class luggage arrival area, ahead of the other luggage that have to go to the regular conveyor belt. Great job by Garuda ground handling! Garuda Indonesia has kept their service level consistently high, and I can see why they are one of the few airlines that have 5 stars rating.

Bali requires a valid PCR Test to enter and we were told to validate our papers at a validation desk at the airport before we can even check-in. Check in was done really quick. We waited at a gate area where there were 3 other airplanes were parked so it was quite crowded and only after other flights took off we were able to get some seats close to the gate. The boarding was done old style, Business class first then Economy all at the same time. However they did not announce to prepare the PCR Test to show at the gate, so after we showed them our passports I have to fish for the PCR Test papers from my rolling bag for the gate agent when we were already at the gate and she asked for it. Or perhaps she just did it randomly because we're not locals, I don't know. The airplane is a 9 year old B738 (PK-GFS) that is still in good condition and clean, however we still sanitize the tray table, seatbelts, screen and armrest with Clorox wipes. The seats are large with ample legroom, and the touch screen even though smaller but still very bright and watchable. They do not have a large selection of movies and music available but more than enough for this short 1.5 hours flight. They still use the two-prong jack so we cannot use our wireless transmitter (3.5"" jack) and bluetooth headphones, but have to use the provided free headphones. The FAs were very courteous and polite, they are super friendly and helpful, and also cheerful in their disposition when interacting with passengers. No wonder GA FA's won awards years in a row for being the best FA in the world! Even for this short flight we got a snack box with savory pastry, cake and a granola bar, and a bottle of water. The FA's also offer drink service along with the snack box. They apologized that due to Covid-19 they can no longer offer hot meal but only snack box in this (short) flight. Very good engagement, again, makes me realize why they were the best FAs! We left 27 minutes behind schedule due to some late passengers, but were able to arrive 12:26 PM local time, 14 minutes early from our scheduled arrival.

"""They offer very good service""",9.0,M Bos,2020-03-22,"✅ Trip Verified |  We flew with Garuda to Bali and back. Their service in-flight is very friendly and good. Checking in at AMS was a tiny bit of a hassle, due to the fact that they let this be handled by Swissport - they just changed this, so we didn't know beforehand. Checking in at DPS however was fine. Due to COVID-19 we needed to go back to NL a week early. Garuda offered special treatment as rebooking could be done at no additional cost (!!) which is very generous from them I think (in comparison, KLM, our national carrier in NL stopped flying at all!). I chat with the Garuda team online at saturday morning about our situation, and, believe it or not, that same evening we could fly back to AMS at 19:05! How's that for service? Checking in at DPS was very friendly and helpful. They arranged the new boarding passes for us so we could get back to NL safe and sound. Arriving in AMS we unfortunately found out that our baggage didn't come with us. In these rare conditions, due to the COVID-19 outbreak, a lot of people took extra baggage with them and Garuda was forced to leave a lot of it behind. I heard from multiple other people they had the same issue, but the baggage arrives fine a few days later. At this time of writing we don't have it back, but it has been just one day, and we should get it in about 3 days - so we don't worry too much about this. All in all, flying with this Asian airline the first time, was very pleasant. Seats of the flight (777-300ER 3U3) were quite large and spacious, but we are just shorties (1.7m) so no leg problems here. As we had a free seat next to us on both flights, we had plenty of space. The in-flight services (beverages and drinks) were also fine. We had chicken, rice and some veggies and another time we had salmon, rice and veggies. In between we got some bread and other small snacks. It was so unfortunate for the stewardesses to need to wear masks, as they all looked so friendly. In-flight connectivity was superb, compared to (for example) United, the Wi-Fi speed was so fast that you could even stream movies from Netflix or Prime most of the flight! Also, the pricing for Wi-Fi was acceptable at around 20 euros for 24 hours. As a conclusion I can really recommend flying with Garuda when you're flying from AMS to DPS (or the other way around). They offer very good service, bigger seats and most important, customer comes in front of money-making. Where our national carrier KLM just stopped flying at all, Garuda keeps flying for at least another week to get passengers back home in these difficult crisis times.",Boeing 777-300ER,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Denpasar to Amsterdam via Jakarta,2020-03-01,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5,yes,Denpasar,Amsterdam ,garuda indonesia

In Denpasar we were met at the parking area by Garuda ground staff. In fact Garuda already contacted me the day earlier asking approx. what time I would be arriving at the airport at. The Garuda ground staff already had our printed boarding passes and the they helped us check in and through security and we proceeded directly to the lounge. The lounge staff were fantastic as they ever went out of their way to make some French fries for my youngest daughter. When it cam time for boarding the ground support came back and escorted us to the plane. We had a warm welcome from the cabin crew and the captain came out and introduced himself and was most friendly. As I had a large breakfast at the hotel prior to check out I did not eat anything on board and only drank some tea, however my wife and two children chose food from the selection on offer and they enjoyed. In Jakarta Terminal-3 the plane parked at a remote location, however Garuda had a bus waiting to take us to the terminal. The Garuda Jakarta ground support team were on hand to help and our baggage was within us within 15 minutes. The ground support were brilliant as they took my youngest daughter by the hand and and it was like big sister helping her small sister and my daughter was very happy.

My younger daughter has the Nasi and Beef, which she liked. The cabin crew kept coming around offering drinks and snacks through out the flight. My daughter watched the inflight movie, which she enjoyed as she laughed a lot.

I complained to Garuda Perth Office and the reply from the State Manager was more or less bad luck and refused a refund for the extra we paid. Garuda Perth to Bali is 100% a budget airline, the food was poor and on the return flight we brought our own food and ate at the departure gate so we did not need to eat on the flight.

On the way back it even offered the choice of a special dish from Padang, which was created by one of the famous Padang Restaurants in Indonesia. This was quite the highlight.

We boarded with really friendly and warm staff, arrived at the seat and a pillow and blanket were waiting. The safety video was really entertaining and we departed on time. After departure we were served breakfast, there were two choices, Omellete or Fried rice, I chose the fried rice, which was really tasty. The IFE on Garuda could have better options, there was a very limited choice but what they offered was still pretty good. Before landing, we were served another full meal, which shocked me, I had beef and rice with Guava juice. We landed late, but smoothly. Surprisingly the crew handed me a Fast track card since I was connecting on a domestic flight and would have to past immigration, I was shocked that the crew gave it.

"""seat is too short""",5.0,S Johnson,2018-10-24,"✅ Trip Verified | I have taken several business flights with Garuda (two long haul - one in an A330 and one in a B777). The B777 business seat is the cocoon type. However, when flattened, the seat is too short to sleep flat out (I'm 1m90 / 6ft3), and it is too narrow to comfortably curl up. The seat cushion also has bumps and ridges across its surface (where the seat surfaces intersect). Other airlines provide top matresses to cover up this up (e.g. ANA, NZA). It's the least comfortable business class seat I have had so far. Luggage is not automatically forwarded to connecting flights (my case in AMS). As a consequence, in such cases the airline will sell you tickets with unusually long stopovers. - It was not possible to reserve a specific seat on some flights. You might get assigned the worst possible seat at check-in. Amenities were standard. No socks or pijama top, so you sleep in your clothes. On the plus side: food and drinks were excellent, staff was very helpful and friendly. Also, the seat had a handy foldaway table which could swivel to allow you to get in or our your seat, without having to clear the table. That's very handy when dining or working - other airlines should take not.

I think it was not only confusing but dangerous (if one goes to the wrong direction, can one end up in another country as all three are international flights). A lot of ground staff around the gate but very inefficient, they did not seem know what to do, so yelled at each other in loud voices. Then we still had to walk a long way through a stuffy corridor to get to the aircraft (parked in domestic area). It was such an irony as I saw Narita-bound LCC Air Asia used the gate next door alone so that passengers did not have to walk far and no chaos. Boarded, was shocked by the new Diamond seat that looked and felt cheap (same design as in their B777 Business but of low-cost material), the design was poor, there was a huge gap between the aircraft window to the seat that anything could easily fall through, and one would have to bother the passenger behind to retrieve.

Such a great service which I cannot recommend highly enough. Returning from Jakarta to London in Business Class was vastly different to the first class experience and not as good as I have previously experienced. There is evidence of cost cutting both in the amenity kit and also the food used noticeably cheaper ingredients. The service from the cabin crew was lacking compared to my previous trips. On the evidence of this, I doubt if I will bother to use Garuda long haul again as it involves going via Amsterdam and there are plenty of other good choices out there.

"""not be using them again""",3.0,M Beatty,2018-09-13,"✅ Trip Verified |  Jakarta to London. Just returned from my much awaited trip with Garuda in Business class, I was seated at 6A. The lounge in Jakarta is perfectly ok,  not like the Middle East carriers and no apparent alcoholic drinks on display but when requested they appear from somewhere. Additionally no diet drinks in fridge but they appear from somewhere when requested. I find this all a bit strange and certainly doesn’t provide any visual improvement to services provided. It does though (in my opinion) present some clear evidence of what’s doing on in the minds of Garuda’s team - not trying too hard are they? Boarding was usual chaotic mess which again is very easily managed if they try hard enough. As someone who usually flies Qatar or Oman Air, the moment I stepped onboard I could see an immediate difference for the worse. They aren’t engaged with you.  Seat was fine, but movie selection old and limited. The biggest issue is service - there isn’t any. Not unless it’s the regular points where they come to ask which meals you want. During the 14 hr flight the NEVER came to ask if I wanted anything or if I’d like a drink topped up. I pressed the call button and that made no difference either. I sat with an empty glass for 45mins. I eventually went up and asked directly.  They were very reluctant to make eye contact of speak to the customers around me. Finally the onboard purser was worse than useless. He in my opinion may be at the root of the problem. Not one did he speak to anyone on business despite pacing around between 1st and business. Over the last few weeks I’ve sent several messaged through their support forms and you guessed it - no reply at all. Even follow up messages to investigate why I’ve had no reply. In summary I will not be using them again and suggest far better service is achieved by booking one of the Middle East airlines - cheaper too.

Again, not the end of the world, however as I mentioned earlier, the flight was not full in business class and there were quite a few children (who don't drink alcohol), so the amount uploaded seems to be insufficient. When dessert was served (it was supposed to be served with ice cream) I asked where the ice cream was and was informed that it wasn't uploaded. So a cold dry cake was not very palatable.

Upon arrival at Jakarta Terminal 3 the Garuda First-Class ground support team were waiting for me. They helped check me in and, then took me through immigration and straight into the lounge. There was a very good selection of food and drinks in the lounge. When time came to board the flight the ground support team were again on hand to escort me to the aircraft. The aircraft left the gate on schedule and we took off 20 minutes later due air traffic. The service on-board was the normal Garuda 5 Star service and the food prepared was excellent. There was free complimentary Wi-Fi onboard and the connection for the flight duration was excellent. We landed at Heathrow Terminal-3 one hour late due to strong head winds. I had a connecting flight from Heathrow Terminal-5 and I was afraid that I would miss my flight and have to spend one night at Heathrow. however the Captain had already contacted the Garuda team in Heathrow and they had arranged for one of their support team members at Heathrow Terminal-3 to escort me all the way through to my connecting flight gate in Heathrow Terminal-5. Furthermore they took my luggage from the plane and had directly taken to my connecting flight. This was Garuda Indonesia at its best i.e. Captain onboard calling ahead requesting the ground team to arrange assistance to ensure that I did not miss my connecting flight. I must say a big thank you to the Garuda Captain and the Garuda Heathrow support team, they certainly pulled out all the stops to ensure that I did not miss my connecting flight.

The flat beds were adequately comfortable (so much better that the awful ironing board beds on Virgin Atlantic 787 aircraft - the worst Business Class ever). Flight attendants were excellent, the food of good quality and beautifully presented. We have flown to Australia with many different airlines over the years and Garuda is amongst the best.

"""crew went above and beyond""",7.0,F Tan,2018-01-04,"✅ Trip Verified |  While the overall trip was amazing, many aspects fell short. Upon checking in, I learned that 5 out of 8 passengers in First class had upgraded. As a full fare F passenger, I was disappointed because not only I ended up paying a lot more, but also I'd be in a packed cabin translating to less personal attention by the crew. The difference was full fare F passengers were personally escorted to the lounge and onto the plane. The lounge at LHR was very crowded. I had a reserved table waiting for me at the lounge and I was able to use the shower for free. However, champagne was not complimentary and I had to pay GBP6 per flute if I order one. Boarding was fantastic as I boarded before it began and I was offered champagne right away by the fantastic crew. They had 2 types of champagne on offer and I ended up trying both during boarding. I saw my neighbour had red and white wine - so I assume you can pretty much order whatever drinks you'd like. It was obvious the crew were slightly overwhelmed as 1 crew kept on addressed me by the wrong name on 2 occasions. She was apologetic and I had no problem with it. I received a kit with very mediocre content (worse than the kit I got when traveling GA J a year before).  However, upon landing, I was given the proper F kit by the ground staff and I was informed they ran out while in London. This might sound trivial, but I ended up noticing things like these when I was flying First. The service was nothing short of spectacular, crew went above and beyond from preparing a wine tasting session (GA had 6 different wine) to sharing holiday stories. Meals were also good. I found the seat to be very comfortable for lounging and sleeping (a duvet was provided for turn down service). IFE could use more selection on movies and complete seasons of TV shows. Arrival service was another major let down for me. Despite receiving a confirmation prior to the trip that I could use their J lounge for a shower after landing in Jakarta (they could not grant me access to their F lounge which was odd considering they granted passengers access when they have a connecting flight even on non-GA flight), I was disappointed to learn upon landing that I could only use the arrival lounge. It was barely a lounge, it was more of a room with small seating areas for F/J pax to wait for their luggages plus 1 shower stall. They did not have a towel in the shower room and nothing could be done by the clueless staff manning the lounge.

The food selection were of three main courses and mostly were of Asian influence. Both presentation and quality were superior and I wish they collaborate permanently with renown chefs as their panels. Quality of amenity and toiletry kits have been upgraded to Clarins which feel more luxurious. If there's downside of the flights would be the choices of beverages which were  limited.

In this flight I'd say I experienced one of the worst. Prior to take-off the male FA closed the overhead compartment leaving part of amenity plastic bag dangling, despite a few rounds of take-off preparation checking by FAs, nobody noticed it that I had to warn him as it may increase the chance the compartment will open during take-off. From his response, I'd say he did not seem to understand the importance of the issue in view of safety.

Since our flight was going to depart at 6:45am, we had to depart from our hotel at around 4, arriving 45 minutes later by which point the check-in counters (there were six of them) were crowded. The flight was delayed by 5 hours, due to a perfect storm of a 2h late departure from Bali, bad weather at PEK, and unprecedented heavy congestion at PEK as well.  This delay would also eventually cause most of the passengers bound for Jakarta to miss their connecting flights. However,  Garuda rebooked every Jakarta-bound passenger on GA421 for free. Both legs were operated by a 2-class high-density 777. Economy seat comfort was top-notch, pitch was acceptable at 32 inches, and Garuda has 18.5"" wide seats in a 9-abreast configuration. Recline was large - 6 inches. IFE screens were 9"" wide and had swipe and scroll capabilities although they were still running on the older eX2 platform with the older monitors, and while the contents were hardly updated since June, they had 8 Live TV channels. Food, on the PEK-DPS leg, had a main course that tasted much better than the one I had on the previous CGK-PEK leg, but at the expense of portion (it was tiny.) The chocolate cake dessert tasted incredible. We were also treated to a bag of mixed nuts as well as sumptuous ice cream just before arrival in Bali. This streak of great tasting food continued on the DPS-CGK leg, with it tying for the best main course meal onboard Garuda I ever had. Service on the PEK-DPS leg was above the impeccable service on my previous CGK-PEK leg, with crew in very cheerful and bright spirits.

However, the snacks were tasty. The second flight was on an ATR72 from BWX to SUB on GA7305. This sector was delayed by an hour, but compensation was more than enough - two discount vouchers. Although this was a short 30-minute hop, the legroom, snacks and crew were all great. Flight was perfectly smooth although we passed through thick clouds. Finally was GA323, SUB-CGK onboard an ancient 747. We were seated on the upper deck, and this gave a sense of tranquility and peace as there were very few other people.  Despite the age, the 747 was amazingly comfortable, with cold cabins and calming ambient lighting. Seat pitch was well above average. Crew were very professional, courteous and friendly. This was a great throwback to the 1990's and did not disappoint at all, despite the lack of a proper IFE. One of the best flights of my life thus far, despite the turbulence.

Then, he took initiative to try to find me the Japanese chicken rice, which was completely finished on board. Finally, he went to the galley, and offered the crew meal, which was chicken with indonesian yellow rice. I agreed to take this. I was amazed by the crew's action to go beyond my expectations.

We go to the International check-in counter where they prepared everything (luggage, boarding pass, etc). After check in we proceed to the immigration. However, I was kinda dissapointed as there was no fast lane and I stood for 15 minutes (I think Garuda should've provided a premium fast lane for their first class passenger to avoid any airport hustle). The lounge is not as impressive as they have in CGK, it's a small but functional lounge with a few sets of table for a la carte dinner and relaxing chair. Nothing much too review, but with excellent service from lounge staff.  When it was already time to board my assistant then came to me and escorted me to the boarding gate. Excellent service from the first class ground staff in DPS. Crew warmly welcomed me by giving their signature Salam Garuda. One of crew escorted me to my seat 1A and poured a Billecart Rose along with nuts and Oshibori. The purser prepared the caviar served with blinish, sour cream and prawn cracker (Indonesian style as the crew called it). It was delicious.. 30mins later the chef on board approached me and discussed about my menu for breakfast.  After finished my meal, I asked the crew to prepare my bed that comes with a duvet and it was so comfy. As I woke up 4.5 hrs later, the crew served an orange juice before they prepared my Japanese Kaiseki Meal (the presentation was excellent). The chef then came to me to ask for my opinion and I think that's a good thing as they tried to interact and get a feedback from the passenger.  The plane then start to descend when the breakfast service finished, and 1 hour later we landed smoothly at NRT airport.

Crew with plenty of warm smiles, genuine hospitality and fluent English. IFE had a responsive touchscreen with adequate content, meals were good enough for the 5-star standard.

Additionally, the plane was a standard 737 which was not very comfortable for sleeping. IFE was the old version with mediocre touchscreens.

Following a 3 hour ""layover"" at Jakarta, I was ready the continue my onward flight to Singapore. Business class on the 737 was a 2-2 configuration and I had the front 2 seats to myself with another passenger occupying the other 2 front row seats across the gangway. Otherwise, business class was empty but economy appeared to be full. These are not lie flat seats but given the relative shortness of the flight, (1hour 30 minutes) offer more than adequate space and comfort. I was greeted warmly by the steward who addressed me by my name and offered a warm towel and champagne prior to departure. I was asked for my choice of post take off drink and my choice for dinner which consisted of a mixed salad with dressing, and then a choice from 3 main courses, followed by desert. In addition to the Champagne, there was a choice of 2 white and 2 red wines to accompany the meal. All 3 courses of the dinner were served together which, given the relative shortness of the flight, was not unreasonable, and my choice of Fillet Mignon with accompanying vegetables was excellent. The crew were very attentive and provided an excellent level of service throughout the flight. I was asked by the steward if I objected to an economy class passengers cabin bag being placed in a business class over head bin because the economy class bins were all full. On arrival at Singapore, disembarkation at Changi was swift but business class passengers are not offered a fast track pass through immigration, although this did not prove to be a problem as there were few arriving passengers. The only negative about this service is that despite being labelled clearly as business class priority luggage, my bag arrived on the carousel last! Not sure if this is something to do with the bags being transferred from the London flight, but I did spend a few anxious minutes waiting and wondering if it hadn't been loaded onto the flight.

"""overall, very impressed""",9.0,Peter Brookes,2016-10-11,"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Jakarta. Priority check in was excellent as was the fast track pass through security. Garuda do not have their own dedicated lounge at LHR and I was directed to the Number 1 traveller lounge which was a disappointment. Very busy, it was impossible to obtain a table in the dining area and I managed to eventually find an empty seat in the lounge area. Leaving this to go to the bar to obtain a drink, my seat had been taken when I returned! Once on board the aircraft, the service was superb. Pre boarded and greeted by my name, I was shown to my seat (6K) and offered Champage and hot towel. My order was taken for post take off drinks and the In flight meal. After take off the drink was served promptly and courteously and I was again addressed by my name. Dinner consisted of a choice of 4 appetizers,4 main courses, cheese and biscuits and a choice of 2 desserts and each course was served separately. A selection of Champagne, 3 white wines, 3 red wines and a desert wine complimented the meal, although this aspect of the service was a little slower and the crew seemed suprised that I wanted white wine with the appetizer and then change to red wine with the main course. The seat was particularly comfortable and had direct aisle access (1-2-1 configuration) despite being a window seat. Following a good night's sleep, I enjoyed a pleasant breakfast of fresh fruit, yogurt and cereals followed by a choice from 3 dishes on the main course. In addition, hot and cold snacks were available on demand during the flight plus a selection of tea and coffee. The crew were discreet but attentive throughout and made the journey a real pleasure.

"""food and beverage service was excellent""",9.0,Peter Brookes,2016-10-10,"Flew Singapore to London Heathrow with Garuda. Business class check in was fast and efficient and I was provided with an invitation to the Dnata lounge which was quiet and relaxing prior to the long flight back to London. Boarding was on time and business class passengers were offered priority boarding. There are 2 business class cabins on Garuda's 777 and I chose seat 6K (the same as on my outbound flight), immediately behind the 1st class cabin, that appeared to be empty. I'm not sure how many business class passengers were in the 2nd business cabin, but I had the entire front cabin to myself. The customary glass of champage and hot towel were provided prior to take off along wth my order for a post take off drink and my selection for lunch. This consisted of a choice from 4 appetizers, 4 main courses, cheese and a choice of 2 deserts. The identical wine selection of Champagne, 3 white wines, 3 red wines and a desert wine were offered as on the outbound flight. Garuda also place significant importance on the selection of teas and coffees that they offer with no fewer than 6 different teas and 2 coffees, that can be served 8 different ways. The whole food and beverage service was excellent in terms of quality, presentation and service. Despite this being a flight operating throughout daylight hours and arriving into Heathrow in the early evening, I personally prefer to try and stay awake as much as possible to re accustom myself to English time, but I've noticed that all airlines that I've used on Westbound daylight flights insist on lowering the window shades and plunging the cabin into darkness after the meal and Garuda are no different. Surely it's better to let the natural daylight in and use the provided eye shades if you want to snooze. Having the cabin to myself resulted in me lifting the window blinds and bringing natural daylight back into the cabin. I doubt that this would have been tollerated if there had been other passengers in the vicinity. I.F.E. with Garuda is okay but there seems to be an accent towards Far Eastern films and my perception of Western offerings seemed somewhat dated. Prior to landing at Heathrow another meal consisting of a choice of 3 appetizers, 3 main courses and 1 desert were offered, that Garuda describe as ""refreshment,"" but was in fact a full early evening meal. An on demand cafe service of nuts, chocolate bars, soup etc. is also provided throughout the flight. Disembarkation at Heathrow was swift and efficient and a fast pass was provided for immigration although Heathrow would do well to have more staff on duty (only 2 when I arrived) as I'm not convinced that there is any significant advantage to this service. Luggage reclaim was fast with my bag first on the carousel. The actual process from disembarking to picking up my car in terminal 3's car park took 25 minutes which was pretty impressive. Overall, a thoroughly enjoyable flight. Unlike some better known, perhaps more fashionable Middle Eastern airlines, Garuda offer the advantage of all business class seats on their 777's having gangway access, so you don't have to be a gymnast trying to climb over someone with their seat fully reclined if you're in a window seat, and wish to move about the cabin. This in itself is a definate advantage flying with this airline. Service is attentive and personable without being obtrusive and the food was very well presented and of a good quality.

On time departure, aircraft appeared to be about 70% full. The seats were reasonably comfortable and leg room was good by economy class standards. Seating configuration was 3-3-3 which is better than offered by many other 777 operators. On demand entertainment system with a reasonable selection of films and music (a good proportion aimed at Asian tastes). The movies weren’t generally as current as some other long haul airlines and the menu system could have organised both movies and music more effectively for ease of navigation but there were enough of both to keep me occupied. Two hot meals served – Dinner and Breakfast – each with two options, Western and Asian. The meals were nothing at all special, standard economy class fodder really, although a printed menu was provided which was a nice touch and there were a couple of hot snack runs between the main meals. Crew were polite and reasonably visible throughout, although some of the cabin announcements were in such heavily accented English that it wasn’t always easy to understand. Connecting flight from Jakarta on a 737-800. Flight time was just 1 hour 20 minutes but impressively there was still a hot meal and full drinks service.

Return direct Singapore - London again on a 777-300ER and again with only partly functional online check in. Departure was on time and seating configuration, occupancy, IFE pretty much the same as the outward leg. Once again, two hot meals en-route, although the only option for second meal was fish. The “hot snack” served between meals turned out to be a cold filled roll, and when I asked for a refill of coffee the stewardess seemed genuinely surprised and I was given just a quarter of a cup which turned out to be lukewarm.

The flight attendants were nice, but not as nice as the ones on the previous two flights, we got a choice of three options for breakfast, an omelette, noodles, and French Toast. I choose the latter and it was slightly above average quality. This was not a bad flight, nor was it remarkable.

"""no suitcases will be on the flight""",1.0,G Shedden,2016-08-11,"✅ Verified Review |  I was flying from London to Jakarta with my daughter for my wedding. When I tried to check in 48 hours beforehand, it wouldn't allow me to. I repeated this process many times until it finally allowed me to check in just 24 hours before the flight. The only two seats left with them were 38J and 38K. I contacted Garuda customer services by phone, and they said ""Theres nothing we can do"" or ""maybe you did something wrong"". They suggested that I get to the airport early, and at the check in desk, ask for a seat reassignment. I arrived at Terminal 3 Heathrow early, only to be met with chaos and mayhem. After a long wait, I was told that there are no other seats to be moved to. We checked our suitcases in and was told to carry our own suitcases back out the door to a cordoned off area where they were holding the luggage. Everything was fine until literally 5 minutes from boarding the plane when an announcement was made that no suitcases will be on the flight except Business and First class. I spoke to the Garuda lady and told her that my wedding was in 2 days time and she understood my situation and wold make my cases a priority. Next ensued a 13+ hour flight with no sleep because of the awful seats. When we got to Jakarta, we completed a Missing Baggage Claim form, and yet again I told them ""Wedding in 2 days, please mark very urgent"". They did mark as urgent, but this made no difference. Despite numerous phone calls to the Garuda, I wasn't reunited with my luggage until the 5th day of my trip.

Meals were satisfying but of limited portion and adequate presentation, complete with a rujak appetizer that they have advertised numerously. In flight entertainment had an unresponsive touchscreen on this flight, and content was of limited quantity as well. On the inbound sector, we had the Boeing Sky interior. Due to the vast majority of the passengers on that flight being WSC participants from Indonesia, Garuda cabin crew called for a special greeting to them during the pre-flight announcement. The seat remained the same comfortable ones found on the previous flight, however IFE improved with a much faster touchscreen and approximately twice more content. The meal was much better as well, both in terms of presentation and taste. I think Garuda has done a very good job at producing flavourful food, even in Economy.

"""streets ahead of QF and CX Business Class""",9.0,C Phelps,2016-06-30,"✅ Verified Review | Sydney to Bali on Garuda Indonesia in Business Class. This was a promo fare and extremely good value for money. The A330 was very new - it still had that new aircraft smell. The business class cabin is configured 1-2-1 across. The seat is well designed and very comfortable with a touch screen control to move the seat to a variety of pre-set positions or adjusted as required. The seat set-up has a separate touch screen controller for the IFE which can additionally be controlled on the touch screen monitor. Due to the fact the aircraft was positioned at a remote gate in Sydney, we had to be bussed to the aircraft which is never a pleasant experience anywhere in the world. The terminal holding area for the bus boarding was full to overflowing with several other flights departing at around the same time – chaotic would be being generous. However, once on board this was all forgotten as we were enveloped with the warm, friendly and professional embrace of the crew. This trip was the first time that I had flown on GA and I did have my reservations, however these were very quickly dispelled. Our crew were attentive without being intrusive, polite and eager to be of service, immaculately presented – a true credit to GA’s training and service standards. On boarding we opted for a pre-take off Champagne (Billecart Salmon) and continued with this post-take off. How could we not have a great flight after such a start? The lunch service was quite simply second to none – streets ahead of QF and CX Business Class and comparable with SQ. It’s fully a la carte (no trolleys ever in the cabin). The glassware is full size not some silly miniature airline imitation of restaurant glassware which was truly a most wonderful surprise. My only comment on the service is that the crew perhaps need to be advised that when pouring wine, less is more. Given that the glasses are quite large, and that 1 in the air is equivalent to 2 on the ground, filling the glass to ¾ full was a bit too much, however I valiantly consumed all that was poured for me. My only criticism is a rather poor selection of English language movies. Given that most airlines these days have on offer hundreds of movies to choose from, I thought the movie selection was quite limited and was thankful that I didn’t have a 24 hour flight to take. I would rate this flight and the GA Business Class product 10 out of 10.

The IFE, however, was strange. I think they forgot to update this particular aircraft's (PK-GIA, their first 777) movie contents. I flew with a younger aircraft in their fleet (PK-GIE) at an earlier date and I saw a more extensive list of movies, so hopefully Garuda will update them pretty soon on all of their aircrafts. Upon arrival at the airport in Jakarta, I used the premium arrival service available for First and Business class passengers, and also holders of GarudaMiles Gold and upwards, which is quite unique. Someone will fetch your luggage for you as you can sit down, take a shower, or have some light drinks. I do encourage Garuda to renovate the lounge and make it even more grand if possible.

Food was just excellent with a chef in the cabin, and far more food served than other airlines business class.

"""What a great experience""",10.0,Changjie Wu,2019-04-24,"✅ Trip Verified |  Beijing to Toronto. What a great experience to take the flight with Hainan Airlines because of the unforgettable assistance we got from Hainan Airlines staff at Beijing Airport! I was bringing my mother-in-law to Canada. However, after we checked in and went through the check point, my mom was notified that her passport was cancelled in 2014 for unknown reason. So she could not fly with me. We were completely lost as we had no idea what had happened. My mom was very sure that this must be a mistake. As all my other family members were 1600 KMS away, I was not sure what I could do -rescheduling my flight to stay with my mom means I have to cancelled a few important meetings, while having my mom flying back to my hometown by herself means I needs to take a big risk - she was over 75 years old and she was already very tired and frustrated. I contacted Hainan Airline in Beijing airport, hoping she could give me some advice. After I briefly explained the situation, staff calmed us down and said she would be very glad to offer assistance. Just after a few minutes, they rushed to the border check point and promised that she would take care of my mom, making sure she could fly back to my hometown smoothly with wheelchair service provided. With her promise that I had faith in, I continued my flight as planned. Luckily, the passport issuing office found the mistake and issued a new one to my mom within 24 hours. The next day, staff spent hours following up my mom's flight arrangement, including pre-booking a premium seat without charging extra fee, having her colleague take care of the luggage, and advising both Beijing and Toronto to provide wheelchair service so my mom would not get lost. Eventually my mom arrived at Toronto safely. My whole family were deeply moved by Hainan Airlines staff.  Big thank you, Ms Qi, and big thank you, Hainan Airlines.",Boeing 787-9,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Beijing to Toronto,2019-04-01,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5,yes,Beijing,Toronto,hainan airlines

"""staff in China speaks no English""",5.0,Derek Northcutt,2019-04-09,"✅ Trip Verified | Was a very pleasant flight though food very poor from Sydney. IFC just okay not much of a selection compared to BOAC, AF, or AA. The reason for the average score though is that this company does not transfer your bags from one of their flights to your connexion flight. You have to collect your bag in China, face a surly immigration official, pass your bag through an x-ray machine upon arrival, then drag it far away and upstairs and check-in a second time to get your connexion boarding pass and to reconsign your luggage. Also, if your connexion doesn't depart within three hours you have to cool your heels in the check-in lobby and sit with your luggage. That is a colossal inconvenience and when you're a man of my age (56) it is difficult. Also, Hainan AIrlines doesn't seem to have the right to use any of the gates at any of the Chinese terminals (or LAX for that matter) so plan on being bussed all over the airports. Another thing that is troublesome is that their staff in China speaks no English.

The lounge that Hainan Airlines use in Shenzhen (it's not their own lounge), but you should not arrive hungry or thirsty, because this lounge can only be called a bad joke: no food, no spirits, no white wine, just some beers and a very poor red wine, soft drinks, instant noodles, that's it. Thankfully, the fun started as soon as we entered the plane. We were immediately offered a welcome drink (including a choice of Champagne) and were warm-heartedly taken care of, with help in stowing our belongings etc. This went on for the entire flight. Super-friendly and competent crew, delicious food, great inflight entertainment and a full range of drinks, from a choice of 3 red wines to even Cognac and other spirits if you wish. The choices of dinner and breakfast were amazing, nicely presented and very fresh and tasty. We very positively surprised of everything, from the cabin (a new Boeing 787 with 1-2-1 layout and full flat seats), through the flight attendants to the cook, who came even personally to you in order to confirm that the food was to our expectations.

"""a great airline to fly with""",8.0,M Zhang,2018-04-05,"✅ Trip Verified |  Los Angeles to Chengdu. The flight was overall enjoyable. The ground procedures were poorly handled by  the LAX ground crew. Boarding  was a mess, since people poured out of the shuttle bus and flooded the jetway. Hainan uses a 2-2-2 configuration in their Boeing 787-8 business class, which is a little outdated since most of the airlines operating transpacific are using 1-2-1 seating. Business class on this flight is fairly empty therefore I did not have the need of stepping over my neighbor. Crew members were nice and helpful. Hainan probably has the best catering among all Chinese airlines. A  bread basket is offered to each and every passenger and meal procedures were carefully followed. I ordered the western entree selection, which was beef tenderloin. The tenderloin was juicy and not overcooked at all (surprisingly). However the asparagus that came with the tenderloin was overcooked. Crew members were constantly walking through the aisles to attend to the needs of the passengers. Right after meal service, economy passengers started coming into the business class cabin and occupying the empty seats - it took a long time before the crew evicted them. In conclusion, Hainan is a great airline to fly with.

Hainan Airline is one of the best Chinese airlines in my opinion because of their great service quality. In SJC airport, they had enough staff so there was only a very short line to check bags.

The food and drink were limited in the lounge but luckily there are enough plugins close to almost every seat. Boarding was well-organized given this B787 was full that day. On the flight, the flight attendant serve with a smile. There were two meals served on board; both of them were unsatisfying, which is pretty common among all airlines I have taken. For Hainan Airline, I think their food quality is too ‘stable’ – they have not improved for several years. The movies in the entertainment system are quite old, and so is the music. However, none of these problems affected my good mood, because the flight attendants were so nice. The only thing for them to improve is that they turned on the cabin light too early before landing.

Very outstanding crew and service. flights were relatively on time, flight attendants were attentive, patient, polite, and helpful. Meal service was probably among the best I've ever had. A menu is distributed with three options for the first meal and two options for the second. On my first flight to Shanghai, my first choice of the first meal was run out because I was in the back of the plane, and the flight attendant decided to start serving the second meal from the back of the plane to make sure that people sitting in the back could have their first choice for the second meal, which was very considerate. On top of that, the portion was big, way much better than almost all US airlines and some other 5-star airlines. Seats are comfortable, with more leg room than especially United.  IFE is very smooth with a wide variety of movies and TV shows. Wifi was slow but free. Cabin announcement is first in English and then Chinese, which I found a little strange. The only downside is the awkward safety demonstration video. I understand airlines try to be creative in their safety demonstration videos but Hainan's is a little bit too much.

The seats were worn with almost no padding let in them. The flight attendants were in a rush to serve lunch and then close the blinds so that they could do their disappearing act. Ground service and check in was very slow at Sydney airport. I was unable to have my frequent flyer number added to my record as the agents were not familiar on the process.

The big plus was probably the comfort, both in the A333 and Boeing 787, the seat space was impressive.

"""service onboard was a disaster""",5.0,Ignace Delville,2017-08-07,"✅ Verified Review |  Hong Kong to Brussels via Beijing on 29 June.  I was travelling with my wife and 2 daughters aged 3 and 5. First, for some reason, I wasn't able to check-in online, as a result we had to queue up quite a long time to check-in. The first part of the flight (Hong Kong to Beijing) was operated by Hong Kong Airlines which belong to the same group. The first flight despite being over 2 hours delayed was fairly pleasant, the cabin crew was nice, food was ok, inflight entertainment wasn't that great, but for a 3 hour flight it was more than enough. Landing in Beijing at the time of departure of the second flight, I requested assistance to the cabin crew for the connection. At our arrival at the gate, a woman was waiting for us and took us to the gate to board the second flight. She was actually running and didn't look behind to see if everybody was following. A fellow passenger was pretty annoyed by that, but for me it wasn't a big deal. The problems started to come up at the security. Ground staff were very rude and checked the kids roughly with no smile, which scared them a bit. Arriving at the gate, we handed over our boarding passes, but we were told the seats had been changed. They gave us 4 different seats at 4 different places of the aircraft. When complaining about this issue, we were told to get on the bus and check with the cabin crew. Boarding the plane, I immediately told the crew the problem. They told me: please take your seats, we will check once everybody had boarded. Really? You expect a 3 and a 5 year old to sit alone in the middle of stangers. I refused and had to discuss with other passengers myself to get seats together. The service onboard was a disaster. First I ask for a Baileys, the FA told me: I give you our cocktail which is made with Baileys and coconut milk ok? No, I would like a baileys. She was unhappy because she had to go back to get the bottle. When she came with the meals I asked for the child meals. She told me very rudely: There's no Child meal if you don't order them in advance (which I did when booking the flight). A few hours later, I asked for a beer, ""no more beers after first service"". When serving the breakfast I asked for hot chocolate for the kids: ""We don't serve hot chocolate anymore"" Seriously?  Again unhappily she went back to make the hot chocolate.

Food from PEK is also good enough for economy class. I recommend oriental food instead of western when taking this flight.

They wanted us to take a flight 5 days later to Vancouver, and didn't want to pay the 80 dollars per day asked by China for overstaying in the country.  We paid a price to get from one place to another. Beijing Capital Airlines should care take of their customers.

"""both flights lovely""",8.0,M Edwards,2016-11-16,"✅ Verified Review | Taipei to Moscow via Beijing (and back the same way) with Hainan Airlines. Outward bound: both flights lovely, with decent hot food and friendly staff that spoke very good English. Both flights also left exactly on time, which is something that hasn't happened to me for years - not even a 10-minute delay when preparing for takeoff. I was planning on sleeping in the airport for my connection, but a Hainan representative met us off the plane and took us to our free accommodation nearby the airport, which was a nice surprise. The hotel itself wasn't fantastic - stains on carpets, strange smell in the room - but the bed was incredibly comfortable (picture attached), so I was happy. No breakfast provided. The Beijing-Moscow flight was almost empty, and I enjoyed having an empty seat next to me. A slightly strange thing was that 2 hours before landing the crew provided more food, but this was just the hot portion of the regular meal served without a tray, which left a bit of a mess on the table and was uncomfortable to handle. However, no other complaints. The return journey: we had a delay of around 2 hours in Moscow, but we were informed of this at check-in. This flight was full, but again, the service was very good. The transit hotel was far nicer this time - I didn't even go out to see Beijing this time around, just slept in it very happily. No complaints about any of the airports, except a note: in Moscow, non-Russian speakers are rare, and sometimes the security staff will yell at you in Russian, which can be confusing. Only one negative about the flight: the entertainment system on the A330 was difficult to work at times, and it seemed a bit old (for example, the flight path seemed to continue on to Spain, for some reason). One final note: Chinese airlines do not allow you to use your phone in-flight at all, even if it's in airplane mode (iPads are ok). I was surprised when a crew member told me to turn it off, because usually I just listen to music on my phone and try to sleep, but this was only a small issue and overall I enjoyed my trip.",Boeing 737-800 / A330-300,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,TPE to SVO via PEK,2016-11-01,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5,yes,TPE,SVO ,hainan airlines

"""attendants very pleasant and helpful""",7.0,M Thales,2016-07-19,"✅ Verified Review |  Prior to booking this flight, I'd never heard of Hainan Airlines, however their introductory fare from Manchester to Beijing was cheap compared with others at the time, I went ahead and booked it. You cannot check in online and it must be done in person. This oddly ended up being a positive for me, as it enabled me to get exit row seats with a large amount of legroom on both MAN-PEK flights (row 48). The boarding was at best a bit of a scrum for economy. Business class had a separate queue which worked well. That said, the aircraft departed on time, so although it was the least relaxed boarding experience at least it worked. Hainan Airlines operate brand new A330s on this route, they're pretty darn clean. Seats for economy are good. Whilst getting comfy in economy on a 10+ hour long flight is never easy I'd argue they're on par with KLM/Air France. A thin blanket and very thin pillow is included, bring your own if possible. The in flight entertainment is okay with a selection of Western and Chinese content in equal proportions. No wifi, no USB power and the power outlets in the exit row seats didn't work.  The food was okay with a mixture of Chinese/Western dishes. Officially, you're not allowed to use your own electronic devices on board, on the first flight that wasn't an issue and I used my laptop and flight-mode phone with no issues, returning from Beijing to Manchester I was told off. Maybe bring a book as a backup. I noticed the flight attendants had a range of language flags on their name tags, English proficiency was mixed but overall good. They're all very pleasant and helpful though, the best I've experienced in a while! Transiting with Hainan for Hong Kong flights route, I flew Hong Kong Airlines on the PEK-HKG routes. Hong Kong Airlines is also part of the HNA Group and it shows, the aircraft are pretty much identical aside from the flight attendants uniforms and a different IFE skin. Transiting through Beijing was not a fun experience. Hainan operate out of terminal 2 which doesn't seem to be fully equipped as a transit point. Finding the transit area was difficult and it was poorly managed. Ground staff at Beijing were not exactly helpful in directing/helping transiting passengers. If anyone is concerned about the transit in Beijing, follow signs towards 'arrivals', once you find a moving walkway look right and there should be a glass-box-room thing for transit. It's not very clear, but that's where you'll need to go. Once you find it, it's pretty simple to be fair. 2 of the 4 flights were delayed, I had to be shifted onto a different HKG-PEK flight to meet my connection (which they were very helpful with) however the trip back to Manchester was stressful. As a solo leisure traveller this was an annoyance that was resolved, however for more critical trips I'd be wary if transiting through Beijing.

Checked pricing on a business ticket and found then $3000 cheaper than others, so a bit skeptical, further read with interest some of the postings from others, as well as the time to complete transfers in Beijing - nonetheless felt adventurous and booked. Called to reserve 2 aisle seats. No problem. Agent spoke English well and confirmed seats on all legs. Arrived at O'Hare at 1330 for a 1520 departure. Check in was swift and painless. Lounge passes issued to Swissport Lounge. Lounge was adequate, but hard to locate. It is a right turn after security and a good walk. It is on the right and easy to miss. Boarding gate was at the opposite end of terminal 5. Boarding went smoothly, found our seats, stowed our carry on bags. The Boeing 787 does not have middle overhead bins. Greeted warmly by the inflight manager, as well as our flight attendant. English language skills were fine. Departed on time. Welcome drinks non-alcoholic offered.  Pillows, duvet and pj's handed out, as well as Bose noise cancelling head phones. Menus handed out. Orders taken and we were off. Service started quickly. Appetizers and ordered beverage arrived before you knew it. Soup and salad were at your table when your appetizer was finished. Main course selection of 5 items with accompaniments. They also served individualized bread baskets - tasty and ample. Refreshments were always available for top off. After dinner drinks offered, as well as 4 choices of dessert and or fruit and cheese platter. Actually, there was enough where you could have whatever you liked. Fully lie flat seat was comfortable, but not built for us 6' tall folks, but able to sleep without issue. The IFE was also ample for the 12 hour flight. Some old, some new movies, screen size was fine. Pre arrival meal had 4 choices. Served quickly again great portions. Throughout the flight the FA's were readily available and continued to ask if they could get you anything. Landed early, but to a remote area. Thus the infamous bus to the terminal. Dreaded the wait for the international transfer to Hong Kong. Same terminal as the arrival. Bus for biz class arrived quickly and attendants had signs with passengers names to assist them. We were guided to the transfer desk, security check and the pointed to the next departure gate. All done in 20 mins. Very classy. On the return it was a complete duplicate.

"""I would recommend Hainan Airlines""",9.0,F Alex,2016-03-24,"✅ Verified Review |  My family had a great trip on Hainan Airlines from Boston to Shanghai Pudong. Thrilled that they introduced this non-stop flight saving hours on the total journey to China. I really enjoyed and prefer the Boeing 787 compared to the 777-300ER. Fast Boarding/deplaning  since the plane is much smaller than the 777-300ER, especially the number of economy seats (only 177 on Hainan compared with say Emirates long haul 777-300 ER at 304). The larger windows and what appeared to be more efficient overhead bins/higher curved ceilings made the cabin feel more open and less claustrophobic. The 3x3x3 seating while not ideal is much better than a 3x4x3 on the 777-300 for long haul. I paid $750 roundtrip, I found the seats pretty comfortable with enough legroom. The economy seat actually reclined pretty far back. Which makes it a bit difficult when the passenger in front has reclined, but nonetheless easier for sleeping. I think the 787 seats are a bit shorter as well, so there is an adjustment to pull the headrest up if you are taller. Cabin crew for the most part were extremely helpful. However, I felt they were a bit more amateur than some airlines, possibly because they were generally on the younger side. Agreed with some other comments about the lack of English, but didn't find this a problem. They cleaned the bathrooms regularly throughout the flight. I thought the food generally was pretty good. I love that they give the option to pre-select a low calorie or fruit platter option for no cost. In addition, they set up a little spread in the back of the plane with all sorts of beverages and snacks so one could help themselves at any time. They came around plenty of times with water and tea. Ask for ""Bing Shui"" or ice water because typically the Chinese prefer water hot. I thought the inflight entertainment was lacking a bit. The TV options and movies while plentiful fell a bit short of other 5 star airlines. The touch screen was also a bit unresponsive and slow. Overall I would recommend Hainan Airlines especially for service to mainland China. They are expanding quickly to unique destinations. I loved the 787 and believe it is a great option for long haul.

Food was ok, and there were snacks readily available in the galley. I'm not a big fan of the side by side configuration of business class seats - prefer the solo (1x2x1) seats Hainan Airlines has on other aircraft. But on this Boeing 787 there's plenty of room, and the seats are lie-flat. TV screen is not angled properly, when you're reclined, so a bit of a strain to watch TV while lying down. The inflight duty free is limited, so if you're bringing gifts home, buy it at the airport.  Definitely would fly Hainan again!

I usually travel between the Bay Area and NE Asian cities using UA, CA, OZ, CI and NH, the price for this newly launched route was reasonable which provides another option from the South Bay / North California. The 787 is fairly new and well-decorated, red wall paper and carpet give cabin ambient a warm touch, seat room looks quite compact at the first glance but as a 6.2’’ tall 195lbs big man I can fit in pretty well yet had a sound sleep after.

Entertainment with the large 787 PTV helped me to kill time with selected movies - some of them were just in cinemas weeks ago. Cabin crews are reachable and willing to help, I saw them cleaning the lavatory mirror and toilet which is a plus. Ground service in T2 I encountered wasn’t that pleasant in contrast with the larger terminal 3 PEK, and it did take more time for transfer passengers. The only major down side of Hainan is their online booking system is not the friendliest I ever used, redesigning is suggested. Overall I am pleased to find this SJC based new route and merry to say goodbye with SFO as well as CA, UA, CI. Pretty sure I’ll use Hainan again for my future NE/SE Asia trips if they offer more connecting flights in PEK.",Boeing 787-8,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Jose to Beijing,2015-10-01,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4,yes,San Jose,Beijing,hainan airlines

Hainan Airlines customer review,9.0,Charles Qian Li,2015-06-19,"As a frequent Chicago-Beijing-route traveller, I know the available carriers quite well, Hainan, United, and American Airlines. Hainan flies this route with its Boeing 787. One thing I love the most about Hainan is that the toilets are always clean! Trust me when I say the sanitary condition of cabin toilets are important for people spending 12 hours or more on international flights, because you will use the toilets at least once. I was sitting in 40K, which is the first role of the second section of the Economy class cabin, and I saw the flight attendants cleaning the toilets on an hourly basis with air freshener. Although I was a little disappointed when Hainan changed its breakfast menu (it used to offer omelet and sausage on all international flights, which I think is the best in-flight breakfast I have ever had!), the food is still pretty nice and superior to other carriers. The flight also offers a self-service snack and beverage bar at the back. And if you have special requests, the flight attendants are always there to provide you with whatever you need. Inflight Entertainment, Hainan still has a long way to go. But I don't see it as a problem, because compared with the entertainment systems on other carriers (Air China, American Airlines, United, Delta, Air Canada), Hainan's still far more superior. Many hit shows and sitcoms are included.  One weakness which Hainan and all Chinese airlines all have is the language service. Although the captain spoke perfectly fluent English, some cabin members didn't. Foreigners may face difficulty understanding their safety instruction or communicating their needs. They still need to work on that.",Boeing 787-8,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Beijing to Chicago,2015-06-01,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5,yes,Beijing,Chicago,hainan airlines

"""Food out of Japan is good""",5.0,D Smith,2022-10-24,"Not Verified |  New business class Suite III is inferior to the Suite II - the area where your feet / legs go tapers off. So if you are a tall person you are going to struggle to bend to the space. When the seat is not in full decline there is no support under your legs - from the seat to the feet area. This means you are going to be constantly trying to find a comfortable position if working / eating or not in full decline. - when you are partially reclined and have the table down it is quite small. The Suite II seat was superior (especially the window seat) on privacy and just in regards to the actual seat. No issues with the recline position/support or table. The flight attendants aren't trained to look at the list of who is a frequent flyer with their own airline. I am a Diamond flyer (the top frequent flyer status) and still watch in amusement that my Japanese wife gets a 'thank you for joining us again today. Thank you for on-going support'. In the meantime, me, a non-Japanese person, get no acknowledgement at all! (I have only been acknowledged about my status less than five times in all). This time - I got... 'You want the Japanese menu of course - that is why you chose to fly with a Japanese airline right? Is it your first time to Japan?' Ask your cabin crew to check the passenger list of non-Japanese travellers. If they are a JAL frequent flyer - then acknowledge them like you do with the Japanese. On arrival into Japan my flight was late (due to the flight arriving in Sydney late) due to the aircraft having trouble in Japan. I was not assisted to get to the next flight to Osaka even though the later flight had over an hour to go until departure I got that flight is already boarded - a domestic flight boarding an hour before departure? Instead, I was put on the Kansai Osaka flight and arrived at 2am in the morning instead of 8.30pm. Ground crew didn't even try and didn't have a 'can do - let's fix our mistake attitude'. Food out of Japan is good. Out of Sydney, it is not good! The quality is lacking. I recommend the western dish out of Sydney and then the Japanese dish out of Japan. Inflight entertainment  is an old system and the choice is OK for a couple of flights. You will struggle to find choice if going on more than a couple of flights a month.

That came in handy when it came time to nap, as I could lie flat across all three seats. It still wasn't as comfortable as a real bed, but it was better than sleeping sitting up.

"""polite, friendly, and accommodating""",10.0,Matthew Carriuolo,2019-12-29,"✅ Trip Verified | Manila to Boston via Tokyo-Narita. The flight from Manila to Tokyo was operated on a B787-8, and the flight from Tokyo to Boston was operated on a B787-9. The infamously horrible traffic in Manila made me arrive at the airport only 57 minutes prior to my departure time. I panicked! Upon arrival at check-in, though, a lady at the business class check-in desk checked me in and assured me that I would make my flight. Indeed, because Japan Airlines boarded the aircraft beginning only 30 minutes before departure and did not close the gate until 10 minutes before departure, things went just fine. I know that many airlines would not be so forgiving of a late arrival. Many airlines also would probably have lost my luggage when I checked it in so late. Not Japan Airlines! It made it all the way to Boston. As for the inflight experience, the flight attendants were polite, friendly, and accommodating. I was seated in a bulkhead seat for the first time in many years, and one of the flight attendants helped me to open up the TV monitor for that seat. The seats were very comfortable. Blankets and pillows were available on both flights. Toothbrushes and toothpaste were available in the lavatories during the flight from Tokyo to Boston. Too bad that there were no amenity kits, but it's always the toothbrushes and toothpaste that I most desire during such flights, so they just barely met my expectations there. Perhaps the least impressive part of the experience was the inflight entertainment. While I appreciated that they offered manga for people to read if they so desired, the selection of movies and TV seemed somewhat lackluster, and it was disappointing that many items were not available with English subtitles. Finally, there was the food. I was served one full meal on the flight from Manila to Tokyo and one full meal and a sort of ""light meal"" on the flight from Tokyo to Boston. We were also served packaged snacks about 35 minutes prior to landing in Boston, which seemed kind of last-minute to me and a little awkward. The full meals were truly enormous-by far the largest meals I have ever had on a flight. The one served from Manila to Tokyo was perhaps the largest of all. The entree was a sort of chicken in a creamy mushroom sauce, served with sliced carrots, sliced zucchini, and fried rice with egg and vegetables. It also came with a vegetable salad with dressing, a fruit salad, a noodle salad, a potato salad with ham and cheese, miso soup, Haagen-Daaz vanilla ice cream, a chocolate chip cookie, a bottle of water, and your choice of beverage. I found it particularly stunning that Japan Airlines has their own kiwi-apple juice blend which they call ""Sky Time Kiwi."" Wow! All of the foods I was served were delicious. One criticism I can make of the food is that with the exception of the full meal from Tokyo to Boston, there was no choice for the meal options. That is, you got what you were served.

The flight from Boston to Tokyo was on a B787-9, and the flight from Tokyo to Manila was on a B787-8. The flight from Boston to Tokyo was scheduled to depart in the middle of a blizzard. Unfortunately, this created some problems regarding preparing the aircraft. We eventually boarded (very quickly, as is Japan Airlines' custom). We then had to wait for a while as our plane was de-iced. We ended up leaving Boston about two hours late. However, the pilots were able to make up for one of those hours in the air, so that we only arrived about one hour late in Tokyo. Another passenger was concerned about making his connecting flight in Tokyo. A flight attendant calmly explained that he would have enough time and that they would hold the flight for him if necessary. This turned out to be unnecessary, as, to my shock, the staff at Narita basically just allowed all arriving passengers with connecting international flights to go directly into the gate area without first clearing security. This was truly a godsend and ensured that people really did make their connecting flights. And since gates weren't supposed to close until just 10 minutes before departure, this meant they did not even have to hold planes for people! As for the inflight experience, it was similar to my experiences from Manila to Boston, except that there was no last-minute snack service just before arriving in Tokyo. Instead, they offered us sweet buns midway through the flight. Again, we were served a full meal on the flight from Boston to Tokyo and on the flight from Tokyo to Manila, as well as a light meal towards the end of the flight from Boston to Tokyo. And once again, with the exception of the full meal from Boston to Tokyo, there were no choices for the meals-there was only one option. However, as usual, all of the food was truly superb. Because I was flying during a different month from my previous flights with Japan Airlines, I noticed they removed from their entertainment system a movie I had begun watching previously and had hoped to finish watching during this trip. That was disappointing. There were toothbrushes and toothpaste available in the lavatories during the flight from Boston to Tokyo, but not until relatively late in the flight.

In particular, the premium economy lunch featured winning entries from a public competition JAL ran, where the side dishes (3) were truly outstanding.

Food was served in a timely manner, with a genuine smile. Very knowledgeable about the product, can answer any question (I was impressed how a first timer in Business Class could answer about almost everything). Food is a difficult topic as some may not like Japanese food and be more satisfied with a nice piece of meat. But in terms of Japanese Cuisine, what JAL offers in business class is excellent. Rare food such as Awabi (Abalone) was even offered. I never took the western menu so I cannot comment on that. The Skysuite product is wonderful, especially on the window side. Thinking this product was introduced in 2013, it is still among the best seat on the market. Window seat offers complete privacy. All seats offer a fully flat bed which does not become narrow at your feet, and a very comfortable mattress and pillow. ANA is just catching up this year with their new product. I prefer this setup compared to the widely used reverse herringbone layout. Plane: The Boeing 787 is a great plane, although I prefer the A350 (the A350 is I think quieter). Boarding and on ground experience: JAL offers to wrap your luggage for free if you wish, which is not the case of all airlines. Check in is efficient, as well as boarding.

The F Sky Suite was nicely designed and spacious, with ample storage space. Meals were good and nicely presented, as expected from a leading F product. Staff are respectful and accommodating. I picked the Japanese menu but also expressed that I liked caviar, which belonged to the Western menu, and the attendant happily obliged. She also offered to make my bed in the suite across the aisle (the cabin was only half full) so I can continue to use my suite for lounging and the other for sleeping. Such small initiatives made a difference between good and excellent service. It should be noted that, unlike many other first class suites, the Sky Suite does not have a personal closet to hang your clothes.

IFE was OK but not outstanding. Although the crew were great, the food (Japanese set ) was not fresh. The drink service was slow as well which for a flight that is not too long delayed food service and resulted in little time for sleep.

Narita is not my preferred airport out of Tokyo because of the long taxi to the runway. But the captain made up most of the delay. For an economy ticket I felt the most impressive aspect of the flight was the excellent F&B service. Indeed I would almost go as far as to call it superb. An extensive drinks offering was followed by one of the few delicious meals I have ever enjoyed in economy class. JAL has a policy of inviting six young chefs develop new and different recipes for economy passengers. My main course of braised beef in red wine sauce with penne pasta and a dash of cheese was quite excellent, the pasta being perfectly al dente.

It is surprising for Japan. The lack of signs at the airport gate area and the size of the gate area were terrible. Passengers did not know which lines to go to and business and first class passengers also had to fight through the crowd to board. The biggest problem with the flight was a screaming infant across the isle. Flight attendants did nothing. The parents and grandparents also did nothing. It was horrifying. People should not be traveling with infants, period, for any reason unless they are moving abroad! These were typical selfish parents who insist to travel with their family and could careless about other people. The flight was full and their kid was crying the whole time. Which means their kid was not comfortable. This selfishness has to stop, and airline staff and airlines need to address it instead of ignoring it.

First sign of trouble began when we started circling Narita and crew warned us there would be a delay in landing. This made me nervous as my connecting flight to Bangkok was in 1.5 hours. We circled for nearly an hour before the captain came on the intercom and said we were being redirected to Haneda Airport. No reason given, only apology for inconvenience. We landed and refueled, waited another 1.5 hours and took off again, landing at Narita 45 minutes later. No explanation given, just sorry for inconvenience. I ran into the airport, hoping that my connecting flight had waited for me, but it was to no avail. My connecting flight had already left. I had to wait in another line for 2.5 hours to get booked on the first morning flight to BKK, and JAL put me up in a Narita Hotel. I found out that the delay was caused because an earlier aircraft had run off the runway, causing the airport delay. Anyway, bad enough, get on with life. A week later I show up at the airport in Bangkok, and JAL ticket counter informs me my flight has been delayed by 3 hours. Oh hell, not again! Which of course means I cannot catch my connecting flight in Narita again. I ask the reason for the delay, they tell me it's maintenance issue.

The Sushi counter is great, but not at 9 am, overall, the JAL first lounge was rather dissapointing. This impression continued for the flight itself. The B789 had the so called Sky Suites III installed, which do not come even close to Qatar’s Qsuite, which I had the pleasure to fly last week. They are very narrow and uncomfortable.

"""my choice over the Pacific""",9.0,Jon Peahl,2018-10-05,"✅ Trip Verified |  San Diego to Bangkok via Tokyo. I love JAL, they are my go to choice over the Pacific.  I purchased a not-particularly discounted one way ticket on JAL through Expedia. I didn't realize that advance seat selection wasn't possible on this class of service, and Expedia didn't mention it. Here's where I became quite disappointed. I'm elite on a partner airline with JAL. When seats are assigned, generally elites get processed first--window or aisle. Not only did I get middle seats, I was inexplicably given a middle seat in the very last row on my second segment, on a flight that had many empty rows. That's not only odd, it's vindictive. Someone (or some software) went out of its way to put me in a middle seat in the last row when there were dozens of better seats available. When I arrived at the airport, I was able to get the connecting flight adjusted, but the trans-Pacific segment was full, with no remaining aisle or window seats, and no upgrades available for purchase. The ticket agent offered to put my name on a list to move me to a new seat. Here's where JAL won me back. I presumed that this ""list"" functioned in the same way it would with US carriers, it got me to shut up and go away, but no one actually pays attention to it. That's where I was wrong. Within 15 minutes I had been moved to a window seat. Now, the rest of the trip was standard JAL. Massive amounts of pretty good food and wine. Fast service with a smile. On time departures and arrivals. Clean aircraft. Let's not forget to mention that JAL only put 8 seats across on its 787s, compared to the 9 that most of their competitors have. More room, more breathable air, and more overhead space. The seats were comfy and had a surprising amount of recline - like ""feel guilty for going back this far"" recline. The entertainment came up a bit short for 17 hours in the air, and curses on the person who offers up 75% of a bingeworthy season of a tv show and leaves us hanging. Narita is weirdly depressing and in desperate need of a facelift, but that was a 90 minute connection and certainly not a reason to avoid JAL.

I made sure to arrive early to check in as me & my partner could not find any seats together. Upon talking to the check in staff they were able to give us a free upgrade to premium economy in order to compensate not being able to have me and my partner seated together on our booked economy fare. I was so shocked by the kindness and sincere empathy the check in staff had in regards to my situation. It was definitely an amazing start to the trip. Apart from being upgraded, JAL's amazing service continued to shine through its efficient ground staff, seat product and service on board. My first encounter with Japanese efficiency transpired with JAL's extremely fast and efficient boarding process. I was one of the first to board and it felt like 5 minutes after I sat down we were already on pushback, boarding literally took about 10 minutes which was amazing for a full flight. Boarding being done quickly meant we had a prompt ahead of schedule departure which was fantastic knowing how busy Sydney Airport can get traffic wise during the morning rush. Staff were very welcoming and friendly. Also, the cabin seemed extremely clean. The toilets were clean and hygienic. During meal service, staff were generous with the food & beverage offerings. Food is never an aspect of air travel I like, however, Japan Airlines offers a range of food options throughout the flight and you can pick up or ask for fresh food like instant noodles, chips, biscuits and chocolate. I couldn’t stomach the lunch service, however the instant noodles were a life saver. There was also regular hot towels distributed through the flight which made it a nice touch. One interesting observation I made was the lack of odour in the cabin. You know that strong aroma you get during the food service in which kind of makes you want to gag (well... at least for me)? Or when the cabin crew usually run drinks service and the whole cabin gets infused with the horrible bitterness of bad coffee? Well there was none of that here, It was very pleasant. I found JAL's IFE to be one of the most responsive I have experienced. The flight map is so interactive and explorable. You can zoom in and out of the map and get detailed views of your flight path. The entertainment selection was also excellent and there are movies in over 20 languages! Being onboard the Boeing 787 also meant the windows are big and the electronic tint provides a calming ambiance to the cabin. This is matched with the soft warm white lighting which was turned on after lunch so people could relax. And later on the flight when the lights were turned off a gentle purple illuminated the ceiling.  Overall, Japan Airlines proved to be one of the best carriers I have ever chosen to fly with.

Unfortunately, there are lows and they related to hardware and software. The seat is comfortable, however my window seat had almost no storage space except for among the magazines next to the screen (see pic). The IFE is truly sub-standard.

It represents great value for money when compared to other premium Asian carriers who  charge 40-50% more for the same product / route. Haneda is a great airport and ground services are in line with any major international airport. Once onboard, one was greeted with warm smiles and friendly approachable service. In flight amenities are within expectation for J, with a (mouth) moisture mask, eye mask, toothbrush, hairbrush and ear plugs. Additionally a pyjama top  is also handed out sometime before or after meal service; as well as a refreshing eye moisture freshening mask before landing. Oddly though, the pyjama vest was offered to me on the day flight back but not the red eye going into TYO. As for the most crucial component of the flight, the herringbone arranged seat - cushion comfort is better than SQ though one still struggles with the non-linear layout somewhere between the pelvis (protruded by the outer front shell) and the left (or right depending on yr location) ankle position which comes into contact with the inner wall curvature. Food wise, the Japanese meal set was excellent- sushi and accompaniments were top notch and fresh. One could also enjoy premium arabica coffee, and on demand cup noodle snacks if needed.

"""seats were wide and comfortable""",8.0,Brian E Smith,2018-04-06,"✅ Trip Verified | JAL didn't disappoint for the most part. The check-in at Haneda was fast and accommodating. I say accommodating because they checked my luggage all the way through to my final destination on American Airlines connecting flight, despite the fact that these were two separate tickets. It seems a small thing, but it was major for me as JFK is a nightmare to connect through. On top of that, the agent gave me my boarding pass for the American flight! Onboard both directions the seats were wide and comfortable. I'm very large and I didn't feel particularly cramped or hindered even when in full recline. The seat cushions themselves are a bit thin, but they do have the extra air weave pads to help with this. Looking around the cabin, you can't help but feel it needs a refresher, but it is perfectly comfortable. The service onboard was kind and fast! They have an onboard order as you like service after the main meal and the food comes to you incredibly fast. The handset ordering function for this food was broken/unavailable both directions, but the response time of the FA was speedy. The food was good and you will not starve. However, if you are particular about your diet in any way, you may wish to order special meals. The western and the Japanese meals one way both featured beef which I don't eat. With the large a la carte menu it is easy enough to work around, but I found the set menus of the first meals to be really limited. AVOD was adequate and better than I remembered.

IFE is using Magic V on this particular aircraft, there was limited content and only few New Releases. Response time is good on the touch screen. Food is the part that I was most excited about but it turned out to be my biggest disappointment. It was probably my high expectation based on the promise of ""Collaboratively-designed menus by 6 young talented chef"" according to their website. I appreciated the metal cutlery though. The food itself tasted bland. The side dishes are OK and the miso soup was a nice touch but oh so salty.There are only 2 meal service and the last one does not give you a choice but the Soba was ok. They also does not give the whole can of Soda unless you ask for it specifically. Flight Crew - very polite, smiles a lot and efficient. Seat felt cramped and I'm only 165CM.

Saw staff I remember from previous years’ visits still dealing with passengers like newbies.

Around 5:30 pm we all were boarding and ready to depart but for some reason the airplane couldn’t fly any where and we were stuck inside for 5 hours then the pilot announced our fly is canceled. Our airplane went back to the terminal but the door couldn’t open because too much snow. So it took another one hour to get out off JAL airplane to go back to the terminal. We all got one sleeping bag, one bottle of water and a small bag of cracker for the night because of the snow storm. In the morning around 8 am we got in line to re book our ticket but all of employee at Narita airport told us we have to call JAL or book online because we were customer of yesterday they couldn’t help us in person. It’s was very disappointed with the way they handle there customers. Then we got in line to put our name and get number to get drawing at 3 pm the second day to see who is the lucky one can fly out. It’s seem like we all refugee waiting list to go back to wherever country. I was lucky that I met an Idian couple when I was charging my phone and later the husband help me to call local JAL to book my last seat at Haneda aiport which is one an half hour away by bus. My phone has international plan but couldn’t call local JAL number and 1800 JAL number took me hours but still no one pick up the phone. We were unlucky with the drawing so have to stay another night to get in to the waiting list at 4 pm fight for January 24,2018. The people at help desk gave us one night hotel which is 2 hours away. I asked the worker at help desk if my 3 friends they don’t want to go to the hotel that night could they have voucher for food instead but they no. I felt so bad for them because they have to stay another night at Narita airport with the same set of clothes. Any way there was a few nice employee try to help us by the end, one ask her boss to give me $30 to take bus to go to other airport to get the fly at 1:30 am. I was so tired because of two nights no sleep and stress out because I have 6 days left for my vacation. That’s was a very bad experience with the way JAL treat their customer.

There was no queue at check-in, immigration was smooth and Narita T2 seemed a little quiet after the Passport Control. Upon arriving at Gate 84, it was even quieter, and boarding was orderly and strictly conducted according to oneworld membership tier and class of travel. JAL’s 788 V2 (SS8) has a generous 2-4-2 configuration in Economy, with 18.9” Seat Width and 33” Seat Pitch. The rear section has 88 seats, which easily composes a relaxed cabin ambience, especially when it was only one third full. IFE was sensitive to touch, sophisticated and loaded with international and classic titles. In-flight Wi-Fi service has three prices when paying by normal credit card, US$10.15 for 1 hour, US$14.40 for 3 hours and US$18.80 for 24 hours. If you are paying with a JAL Card, the prices are US$9.15, US$12.95 and US$16.80 respectively. Asked one Cabin Crew in particular a specific loading question, she was visibly annoyed. The Cabin Manager noticed the situation and personally came to apologise for the ‘service attitude’ and gave me a small present from the Captain. For the remainder of the journey, I received unprecedented and somewhat uncomfortable levels of pampering attentions from the crew members. Two meals were served after takeoff with five or six types of grain or chocolate made snacks readily available between meals. The first full meal was designed by JAL’s one of six RED U-35 Cooks, including Kazutoyo Inoue from Szechwan Restaurant Chen. The second proper meal ‘Air Yoshinoya’ came in the form of a bento box, which was served exactly two hours before touchdown. In-flight beverage list contains 10 types of Soft Drinks including the JAL Original Drink - SKY TIME “Kiwi”, and wine, beer, sake, whisky, gin, vodka, brandy and plum, a total of 8 varieties of Alcoholic Drinks.

The bathroom had a padded drop-down floor and seat so that you didn’t have to stand on the floor or toilet to change! Then all five staff working in First Class bowed and introduced themselves, and the Japanese 9-cousre menu started shortly after take-off. Many fine champagnes and sakis were offered and enjoyed, as well as the offer of the entire Japanese menu after mentioning that I had not tried many Japanese cuisines.

It is a great value considering the services provided. You get designated check-in, priority luggage check, and access to the Sakura Lounge at Narita. Because it was a late night flight, people like myself were eating full meals in the lounge in order to skip the late night dinner service onboard. Plenty to choose from: teriyaki chicken over rice, their famous beef curry over rice, dim sum, soup, sandwiches, and Thai curry were some of the choices. We also got a massage and a shower in before boarding the aircraft. Of course, people did eat on board, too, which consisted of a posh Tokyo ""yoshoku"" chain called Shiseido Parlour and while I didn't eat anything, the meals definitely looked better than your average economy meal. The seats are a little hard after 5 hours and the recline is the slide type which many people dislike, but since I can't sleep on planes anyway, it didn't bother me. There is ample space both in width and in leg room. The service is flawless. The AVOD was adequate. A smooth flight going over. Coming back, the 787 was even better. The toilet in economy with a washlet was a welcome treat. There were two babies traveling in the front row of premium and they were treated like kings! The older flight attendants doted over them the entire flight with special meals, chatting, games and toys, and of course bassinets.

The food was good quality. I'm XXL and legroom is usually a problem, but it wasn't so bad on this aircraft. However, the seats seem a bit low and there was blockage under the seat with AVOD boxes, so it wasn't really comfortable overall. The cushions were thin. The aircraft is a 787, but it must be one of the oldest! If you paid for a staggard, lie-flat bed in business, you'd be sorely disappointed as they are the old neo shell seats. The interior was not the great ""wider seats"" they advertise and the AVOD was rather limited. I think if you are Japanese (or are fluent in Japanese) you'd be happy, but it was a rather lame assortment of major Hollywood blockbuster features with few interesting selections.

"""my chosen option for this route""",10.0,K Rayaki,2017-01-05,"✅ Verified Review |  Absolutely the best Tokyo to Sydney option. It does use Narita as opposed to Haneda, but JAL certainly makes up for the slight inconvenience due to the distance to the city. Firstly their fare is cheaper than Qantas, and even the Jetstar flight via the Gold Coast. Secondly their luggage allowance is more generous (23kg x 2 check-in) so it was a nice surprise to be able to relax at the airport baggage-free. Thirdly their staff, both ground and air, were so competent. They were efficient and knew not to disturb you unnecessarily, while keeping the signature Japanese Omotenashi mind. Also they serve you plenty of drinks and quality food, with warm breakfast. I did think the flavour was too much to the Japanese liking (e.g. they served rice-featured breakfast and no other options, if I'm not mistaken), but it was one of the best economy class meals around.  could not stress more how wonderful the spaciousness of the ""JAL Sky Wider"" seat arrangement was.  The only complaint is the range of movies and TV shows shown. Qantas offers more alternatives than JAL and ANA's typical blockbusters and Friends. Overall, JAL will be my chosen option in the future for this route, unless Qantas lowers their price, as I'm their FF member.

I could not have been more pleasantly surprised - and quite frankly shocked - by the great experience we had on Japan Airlines. The service was just excellent. Courteous, attentive cabin crews, genuinely interested in the comfort and care of passengers. Need some assistance by turning on the cabin attendant light? A cabin crew member will rush over to see what you need. Plenty of good food and beverages served throughout the flight. Think you're thirsty? Well, a cabin attendant just happens to walk by with juice or water. The economy seats we had were very comfortable, even for the long journeys we had. The 787 is a wonderful airplane to fly in.

"""high expectations were never quite met""",6.0,William Wood,2016-11-22,"✅ Verified Review | Shanghai to San Diego via Tokyo. Everything you read ranks Japan Airlines at the top, so I decided to try them as the last leg of a OneWorld round the world trip. Also, I could fly into my hometown of San Diego rather than the usual grind of landing in LA and driving south. From the start, I had high expectations that were never quite met. The flight from Shanghai to Tokyo was short and unmemorable which is interesting, because I always enjoy the Shanghai to Tokyo flight on ANA. I had higher hopes for the Tokyo - San Diego flight based not the least on the airframe, the B787 Dreamliner. This is my favorite plane. I typically try to exclusively fly this if possible due to the reduce noise, lower pressurization and, typically, newer configured cabins. For JAL, the latter was a huge let down. Not that the cabin was old. It was very new, but the seats were the reclining type, not the lay-flat and in today's business class, that is simply not competitive for a 12 hour flight. Outside of the seat's limited recline, the overall pod was comfortable with storage in all the right places. The entertainment system was also very good. Overall, it was a comfortable seating area, but with no lay-flat, when it was time to sleep, JAL failed. While I was awake, though, the service was excellent. The attendants were attentive and professional and were always around to help. The food was very good, as well. I can see why JAL is rated well as an airline, but the absence of lay-flat seats will put them out of the running for me as a carrier. It is too bad, as I frequently fly to China from San Diego and JAL would be hugely convenient.",Boeing 787,Business,Business Class,PVG to SAN via NRT,2016-09-01,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3,no,PVG,SAN ,japan airlines

"""the food selection is not great""",3.0,Leo Reuter,2016-11-01,✅ Verified Review | As this flight leaves Singapore after 1am there is no meal served after take off. In fact it was difficult to even get a drink. Whilst the flat beds are relatively comfortable they are also very narrow. The choice of breakfast served before arrival in Haneda was either Japanese or western. I opted for the western but the meal bore no resemblance whatsoever to a western breakfast and was mostly inedible. The overall service level was average at best. For the return flight to Singapore we flew from Narita but as in the same flight taken earlier this year the plane was almost an hour late in departing due to heavy traffic around 6pm. Passengers should also be reminded that the walk from the JAL lounge is around 15 minutes as the gate used for this flight is the furthest away on the particular pier that's used. The flight itself was acceptable although the food selection is not great. Moreover my wife was served half an before me even though our food order was taken at the same time.

From ground service to in-flight to after flight. They were not only extremely friendly, quick and punctual, the seats were comfortable the crew had some humor, the entertainment system was easy to use (no annoying pressing 100 times until the movie plays) and the window brightness could be regulated which was an amazing alternative to the blinds in case one wants to sleep but the other wants to enjoy the view. Controllable sunglasses for the window - first time I saw that. Also they served some nice and good food including Milka chocolate, ice cream from Häagen Dasz and a ""Bauer"" yoghurt. We all know these are great brands. The service couldn't be better - and always a smile on their face, which makes you feel even better while travelling. The poor English didn't bother me at all.

Flight from Sydney to Narita departed early, as all passengers and crew were ready to embark.

Arrival was ahead of schedule and disembarkation was well organised. Overall, having experienced Premium Economy (PE) with CX, I found the JAL PE to be sub-standard. Apart from the PE seats in JAL and a separate check-in counter, the catering, baggage allowance, etc.. is exactly the same as Economy.

The JAL system would not allow me to complete check-in, advising I had to contact my travel agent. This was bizarre, as my ticket was purchased from JAL direct! At Narita Airport I was directed to the Premium Economy check-in. When I presented myself at the counter to which I was directed, the staff  told me they were closed, and took me to another counter which was also closed! Staff subsequently turned up and completed my check-in, however, the check-in process was disorganised. Flight departed on schedule. Food quality was of a poor standard. I had expected better from JAL when departing from their home base. I had also expected to find some typical Japanese dishes on the menu, but they were absent. Flight was not comfortable, as the crew had the climate turned up and it was way too hot and made it too uncomfortable to sleep. Most passengers in PE were visibily hot, as people removed all but necessary clothing and didn't use the aircraft blankets - requests for reduction in cabin temperature were ignored. Initially I presumed that to acclimatise us to the colder weather in Sydney they would reduce cabin temperature as we approached Sydney, the ambient temperature in Sydney being 6C. However, this was not the case. I was still sweating when I left the terminal and went into the open air. Flight arrived on schedule, however, disembarkation was very slow to be implemented and seemed disorganised. I understand that First and Business Class have priority, however, there was a long delay to allow others to disembark after all the First and Business class passengers had long since disappeared into the terminal.

Departure was on time, cabin was pretty full. I had an aisle seat in the middle section. This provides for least privacy in the business class seats it seems. Crew was attentive and friendly. The flatbed seat was pretty decent. I did not use the separate ""memory foam"" futon. Temperature in the cabin was pretty much room temperature, not too cold and not too warm either. Inflight entertainment system worked but seemed unfinished. It was difficult if not impossible to pause a movie, for instance and the flight map didn't seem to provide any control.

However, they have changed the aircraft on this sector, and Japan Airlines offered one of the best value business class tickets to Paris from Sydney plus the opportunity to stopover in Tokyo. I was very impressed - the flights and experiences were almost faultless. The flatbed seats equipped with optional mattresses were wonderful, all seats have aisle access, the staff and service were excellent, the food and beverage offering (esp if you like japanese food) was great, all flights were punctual and arrived on time or earlier than scheduled. Huge TV screens (23inch), excellent Bose noise cancelling headphones, quality amenity bags (Tumi and Zero Haliburton), good and improving selections of entertainment options. If I were to quibble, Japan Airlines could improve their amenity bags by providing better skincare products and provide a larger and thicker pillow.

Knowing this I requested the purser on both long hauls to lower the cabin temp in our zone, which she did.  Such an improvement. Quality of the food is fine, but JAL really skimps on the SFO-HND route, evidently since in both directions the departure is after midnight.

Perfect and changing planes there was a pleasure. On the other hand, the San Francisco Sakura lounge is pitiful. Overcrowded, terrible food, frankly an embarrassment.

The seat was hard and uncomfortable, however legroom was decent and the u-shaped pillow was nice. The seat pockets barely stretch, so they cannot be used to store anything other than thin objects, not even the water bottle they provide pre-flight. Food below average compared to other airlines. The SFO-HND route featured chicken sandwich as a snack and chicken porridge for breakfast. HND-SFO route featured a tuna melt as a snack (that sounds like a recipe for disaster, right?) and a corn soup / cream of broccoli mixture. I was expecting more, having flown ANA and United in the past. Note that you can look up the inflight meal on their website. For IFE there was a personal tv on the back of each seat, with a decent selection of movies and television programming, though not as much as on Delta flights that I have been on.

Japan Airlines customer review,8.0,Frank Zhao,2015-07-20,"On JFK-NRT route Japan Airlines upgraded their B777-300ER and B787 seats to SkySuite, which offer surprisingly generous space and big screen (10 inches). I was very satisfied with everything including cabin crew service, flight meals, seat pitch, but only except inflight entertainment system, movie selections to be specific. The movies were a little bit outdated with limited western selections, but would be ideal for Japanese passengers since half of the movies are Japanese. JAL used B767 for its NRT-PVG route, and most passengers appeared to be Chinese tourists traveling with kids. The boarding process was a bit chaotic and the flight was full. The A/C on this segment was outrageously strong, and I was frozen sitting on a window seat. The flight attendant was very considerate after I told her this problem. Again, the cabin service was excellent; meal was good, but the inflight entertainment system was a bit old but still acceptable. I would definitely fly them again, for its top-notch service. JAL definitely deserve a 5-star rating.","Boeing 777-300ER, Boeing 767",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Shanghai Pudong via Tokyo Narita,2015-07-01,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4,yes,New York,Shanghai Pudong ,japan airlines
Japan Airlines customer review,10.0,L Alvin,2015-07-03,"Was actually a domestic plus a international flight. Upgraded the domestic ones to Class J (Note: they never mentioned it was business class, and neither did I think it was business class). Domestic: No food, just drinks on board. pretty decent and Class J seats were nice. Staff were tentative and smiling. No complaints at all. International: NRT-SIN-HND (JL711, JL038). Both were good. I ordered the gluten free meal and got exactly what I wanted. Staff were nice, boarding was efficient, and never a minute late. Only thing to say is the IFE, low selection of movies as well as songs (can't blame them as Japan is almost half a decade slow in releasing movies). Food was good. Best parts of JAL: Great Economy seats, and marvellous punctuality. If you are looking to get in for a transfer with only 1.5 hours for transit, this is the airline to take.

In-Flight Service : Very friendly and accommodating as Lufthansa has been in the past. Seat-Comfort - Due to the half empty flight, I was happily able to stretch out. However, even in a full flight, the seat would have been above average by economy standards. I can recommend the mini-economy cabin in front of economy plus on this particular plane. Food/Beverages - Good selection of beverages. Meals were fine (Ravioli for dinner and a sandwich box for breakfast), but nothing special by economy standards. No choice food alternative choice was provided. Entertainment - A bit of a more dated touch system, that was a bit sticky to navigate, but overall a good selection.

It was explained to me, that, as this was a day flight, there was no reason for the kits to contain earplugs and eye masks. For the same reason, there were no pajamas offered. One alcohol wipe was given to each passenger upon boarding and this seemed to have taken care of all hygiene concerns, as I did not see the bathroom cleaned during the flight. C-class bathrooms contained no amenities. Beverage service was the only thing that seemed to be alright. Food was poorly presented and of a sub-par quality.

I booked a one-way CGD-FRA-HKG trip at the last minute to replace a cancelled Turkish Airlines flight and Lufthansa took me to my destination safely and on time. Check-in at CDG on an August Sunday afternoon was just one long queue for all Lufthansa and Swissair flights (despite buying my ticket online, check-in via the app was disabled). Even arriving two hours in advance, you would have very little time to spare to reach the aircraft given how slow things were going (luckily I was spotted by an airline rep as having no luggage to check in and was moved to the free business counter). The A320 to Frankfurt was new and spotless. The crew went around handing out a single alcohol towelette to each passenger in a great display of hygiene/safety precautions (other airlines give you masks, gel, wipes, etc). Each passenger was given an individual bottle of mineral water  and Swiss-style chocolates. That was it, for an early evening flight. On the FRA-HKG leg, there was no choice of dish for dinner or the usual apology of ""sorry, we have run out of"" -  some penne in tomato sauce. Breakfast was very skimpish and un-German (picture).

Seat comfort was very good - seating arrangement in Business at Lufthansa gets often bad reviews, however I do prefer their open concept to many pod arrangements from other airlines. Food was served speedily and was of excellent quality. Even though the flight was fully booked (actually overbooked due to the need of having to accommodate apparently a cancelled flight to Toronto) crew managed to be very attentive, quick and always friendly.

Breakfast prior to landing was a sandwich. Flight attendants very efficient. The 747-8 provided a very smooth flight albeit with some minor turbulence over the Atlantic. This aircraft had the old familiar livery of LH which I actually prefer to their new livery. Landing was smooth, deplaning very interesting.

"""I certainly was not alone in my feeling of disrespect""",3.0,Marc Merritt,2021-06-12,"✅ Trip Verified | This is the first time I flew with Lufthansa with family. I chose Lufthansa for a number of reasons, mainly reputation, route, price, and recommendations by others. I must say I was extremely disappointed. Terrible infotainment system - slow and clunky. Terrible economy seats - they recline but the seat pad does not move forward like others airlines such as Emirates, Turkish, Ethiopian, etc. Many rude flight attendants. Unsurprising given most are German, but still, should be more pleasant. No meal choices. Every other airline I have ever flown has offered at least some food choice ~ meat, chicken, fish, etc. Not Lufthansa! It was pasta with tomato sauce and wasn't even tasty. I sent emails to the Lufthansa customer relations department. Here is the context of my email. We traveled from Frankfurt to Johannesburg on flight LH572, departing on June 3 at 22.05, which lasted approximately 10 ½ hours. During this time, we experienced disrespect, rudeness, and overall unpleasant attitudes and service by some of your flight attendants. We were seated in row 32, seats G, H and K. I understand that food is limited, however, when we inquired if our daughter could have an alternate meal, the female flight attendant blurted out “Everyone has the same thing! If you wanted a special meal, you should have requested it before the flight.” That’s fine, but the insensitive and rude behavior of this flight attendant was not acceptable, by any culture! When the plane pulled into the gate at Johannesburg, the fasten seat belt sign was turned off. I stood up to stretch my legs as I am tall and my knees hurt. Again, this flight attendant shouted at me to “sit down until you are told to get up!” Is this the type of behavior that is tolerated by your airline? Based on reactions from other passengers on this flight, I certainly was not alone in my feeling of disrespect, almost disdain, by some of your flight attendants, as I was not the only passenger she yelled at.

The steward was very nice, because although we were not expecting while eating, he brought us some spare dishes from Premium economy, which was a nice touch to make it up to our satisfaction, which was worth to it. Short sleep and bright good morning over Namibia´s desert with a quiet tasty breakfast, after it we were shortly landing.

The person who served me was nice and personable, the rest were just going through the motions as quickly as possible. Went to the kitchen a few times to get water. Had to ask for ice and was served out of almost flat mineral water bottles. Soft drinks were served out of bottles into glasses, small amounts, had to ask for more. Food was reasonably tasty but nothing special and portions were small. More of a Degustation size/type menu than proper meals. Very disappointing. My wife and daughter, who were sitting further up front could not get another croissant nor the scrambled egg choice for breakfast because they were none left and the server was grumpy to them.

Short hops between LHR-FRA were on new A320-neos in both directions and were perfectly comfortable with a small snack provided. Long haul A340-300s used to Chennai say they are 'operated by Lufthansa Cityline' but the passenger experience is identical to normal Lufthansa. Seats are comfy enough with adjustable headrests, sufficient pitch for 6'2 male and decent recline for night flying; managed to sleep almost 5 hours! Although the planes may be getting on now, the interior feels very freshly refurbished and still love Airbus A340/A330 planes in economy with just 2-4-2 layout - much better than Boeing's now standard 3-4-3. Entertainment was good quality screen with decent enough selection with probably about 70-odd movies though a poor selection of mostly German TV programmes. The meal just before Christmas was delicious goose, sauerkraut and dumplings, and with metal cutlery too, then a small sandwich-sized snack before landing. Toilets were kept clean (though maybe best to avoid being too close to them as they got a bit whiffy at times and with all 5 loos together in the middle of the plane, lots of footfall during flight), cabin crew were efficient and were perfectly friendly with me - as a German speaker they seemed to reserve a special extra level of smile when someone spoke German, but I saw several being very direct with other non-native English speakers regarding putting bags in lockers and one seat assignment at the start of the flight. An Indian chap in his 40s found someone sitting in his seat and sought help from an FA to talk to the person, to which she replied condescendingly, ""I think you're old enough to ask that yourself, aren't you?""

Having connected from Dublin, spent some time on the Senator Lounge which offers a great selection of food and beverages. Boarding was fairly orderly but started late. LH appears to be losing its discipline when it comes to on time boarding and departures. On board, the hard product offered decent space for one’s belongings but the fact that not every seat has direct aisle access remains a downside for LH business class. The seat offers limited privacy and the fact that it is angled towards the neighbour, makes it quite awkward in the fully flat position as a mere 1 inch divider separates the respective foot wells. The seat was narrow compared to business class seats found on other carriers. It was not particularly comfortable in the lie flat position. The service was in typical LH fashion, efficient but lacking warmth. The food and wine offerings were quite good however, the salad consisted of limp mesclun greens and was sort of thrown onto the tray. The snack served prior to landing was actually better tasting than the lunch offering consisting of a delicious soup and very tasty prawns. The IFE had a good selection and I especially enjoyed the cameras showing the exterior of the aircraft. The toilets were kept in immaculate condition throughout the flight.

Hardly time to visit the toilet and certainly not opportunity to go into the Lounge. At the boarding gate I asked about my luggage and I was reassured by the staff, after checking the computer, that it had been transferred successfully to the second plane. After boarding the plane, lunch time, we were informed that there was no catering service at all due to the recurrent issue that they have had .. for over 2 months now. But being served just a wafer is totally unacceptable, they didn't make even the effort to get us a sandwich despite departing from their main hub. Credit must be given to the crew on board as they had to put up with this situation for not fault of their own but because of the incompetence and unprofessionalism of the company. To add insult to the injury my luggage didn't make it to the second plane and it was still in Frankfurt (despite being an easier journey through the airport than mine) so I had to spend another 25 extra minutes to go through the queue and forms at the baggage handling company desk in Madrid. I had to beg then for having it express delivered on that night (only Senators and HON members are entitled to such privilege) despite being Star Alliance Gold and Lufthansa Frequent Flyer. Fortunately the staff took pity of me and they managed to get it approved by Lufthansa. Needless to say that I sent the feedback form to customer services on the very same night.

I have chosen this airline for many years as a family friendly airline and for its reputation. Unfortunately when I traveled this time it was a total disaster leading me to write this review. I consider myself a frequent flyer, having done this trip over twenty times but never with an infant. I have a multitude of complaints including complete disregard from crew and personnel, unsanitary conditions on the flight and rude service. I am extremely disappointed and will never choose this company again after paying $1700 for this roundtrip ticket. First, I paid extra for a special seat to accommodate my daughter and I and found myself in the middle row. I understand that I chose to have her in my lap as these were the only options given to me during booking. Secondly, the staff in economy was extremely rude and unaccommodating to our situation and even refused us a bottle of water. Thirdly, the conditions in the plane were a disgrace. People were throwing up in the aisle, multiple passengers had their bare feet on the seat rests and television monitors with no consideration for others and the crew did nothing to remedy this. I was horrified at the thought of changing my infants diaper in the bathroom under these conditions. Lastly, no one showed any consideration or patience while aware that I was carrying an infant, a stroller and two carry-ons while boarding and deplaning and no one offered a seat on the bus that brought us twice to two different terminals forcing us to stand and trying not to loose our balance. I understand that I am not in control of the behavior of others, but the crew showed complete indifference towards this and lacked complete empathy for the passengers on this flight and my daughter and I. I believe that the crew's lack of care reinforced an atmosphere of total indifference.

"""would not be my first choice""",2.0,J Aberg,2019-07-25,"✅ Trip Verified |  Copenhagen to Los Angeles via Frankfurt. I have found Lufthansa becoming more and inconsistent in their performance. On the first leg, we had secured nice exit seats with plenty of leg space, to be told at the gate that we had instead been upgraded to business class. However, this is is the first time in 25 years of travel that I get an upgrade, and the service offering is a down-grade. First off, the seat pitch is less than in economy class (compared to the exit seats we had). Then, it turns out that there is not enough business class catering, so  we each get a KitKat snack to keep us happy. Suffice to say that If I can afford to pay more than 1000 USD for a ticket, I can afford to buy an unhealthy snack for 50 cents. The purser expressed that she was ""sorry"". I acknowledge her statement, but I would much more appreciate her fixing the problem. The long-haul portion of the trip was average. The IFE and power supply did not work for me and the people sitting next to me, and it took the crew hours to figure this out. I had ordered Lufthansa's a la carte dining, which has been very good in the past. Today, parts of the meal were very unattractive. I cannot believe that they have the heart to charge 30 EUR for a rip-off of this sort. A final observation from the long-haul part was that we spent almost an hour holding at the tarmac at LAX, after landing, before finally arriving at our gate This was handled very poorly by the cabin team.

"""service was just outstanding""",9.0,Sarah Plack,2019-06-18,"✅ Trip Verified | On our recent flight from Dubai to Frankfurt, we decided to upgrade our Lufthansa Ticket to Business Class using Lufthansa Miles. As Lufthansa only operates one flight at night, baggage drop-off is only available 3-4h prior to departure, unfortunately. The Lufthansa Lounge in Dubai is rather small but offers a good selection of food and self-service alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. We had already eaten at the Ahlan Lounge before thanks to our Priority Pass and have to admit, that Ahlan Lounge has the better offering. But as soon as we were on board, we were glad to have chosen Lufthansa again! The service was just outstanding and ground staff made sure we were reseated next to each other (it was not possible during online check-in). We were offered drinks immediately and were shown the menu with food for later. As this flight was only a bit over 6h, Lufthansa was serving a light midnight snack and breakfast. Both dishes were really good and were met by a good selection of drinks. The seats in Business Class are full-flat on the A330 and offered a comfortable night sleep. It's not the biggest business class seats available, but definitely comfortable! In the morning we woke up relaxed and left the plane after a refreshing breakfast. I can wholeheartedly recommend Lufthansa Business Class! =",A330-300,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Dubai to Frankfurt,2019-06-01,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4,yes,Dubai,Frankfurt,lufthansa

I decided to retry it since it was the best flight connection and LH flies the new A350 on the route.  Lufthansa business class remains among the worst in the industry.

There is only a small divider with the footrest of the next business class seat, which is unacceptable in my view.

They seem to have layered so many pages on top of one another, that when you click on a button, you wait 10 to 15 seconds for the next page to load. Then, when you think you have it loaded, some other layer loads on top, and moves the screen so you have to search for what you were just doing.

I then tried the APP - couldn't eventually book it in the APP because I kept getting kicked out.

"""boarding was a total mess""",5.0,R Jano,2019-02-19,"✅ Trip Verified | Miami to Munich. How Lufthansa is a 5 star airline has always baffled me but this time I really got the confirmation. I will not blame them for the 3 hours we spent on the plane before departing on our outwards trip (MUC-MIA), there was heavy snowfall in Munchen and we had to wait for the runways to be cleared and the plane to be deiced. However, during those 3 hours there was no service at all. I wasn't expecting much, but a glass of water would have been nice though. Now, the A380s cabin is seriously outdated. And even though it's clear that the plane we flew on recently underwent a C-check, being repainted in the new livery, the didn't bother retrofitting the cabin, so you get a 10 year old in-flight entertainment system. The touch screen barely works, it's slow to respond and responds only to every 3rd of 4th command. And on the inbound leg (MIA-MUC) the control keys (volume, channel, reading lights) didn't work at all. The IFE also froze and reset several times. On the outbound flight some passengers had the IFE not working at all and although they announced on the PA systems that they reset it several times, it didn't solve the problem. We also landed with the cabin light on (they should have been turned down) due to the same electrical problem. The seats are quite uncomfortable and the pitch in economy is just bearable and there are large metal containers protruding in the leg area. I have flown on low cost airlines which had the same seat pitch. There were no amenity kits provided, which if I'm not mistaken, should be provided by a 5 star airline, even in economy (I have flown on ones that do). The food is also nothing to brag about, it's half decent but certainly expected more from such a prestigious airline. On our backward trip the crew arrived late (but again, not their fault since there was an accident and a traffic jam), however the boarding process was a total mess. People aligned according to their seat numbers, but then they decided to randomly close lanes and just board people wherever. There wasn't even a boarding announcement, just for first and business class. When they started boarding Economy and Economy Premium they just opened two random lanes. This meant that no one really knew what's going on and the random boarding made the boarding time unnecessarily long for such a large plane (people in the back which should have been first ended up waiting for people in the front to sit down, who should have been boarded last). The crew however is pleasant, smiles and does a good job. The pilots also seemed professional and seemed to have everything under control, despite quite rough turbulence at times. At least this time our bags arrived safe, this is a miracle for Lufthansa since they managed to break 2 trolleys on my previous flights. In conclusion, definitely not a 5 star airline and regret choosing them over the other 5 star airline with which I could have flown (despite the fact that my flight time to MIA would have been an hour longer since they operate from a different hub and would have had other connecting flights).",A380-800,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Miami to Munich,2019-02-01,3.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1,no,Miami,Munich,lufthansa

"""isn't worth the money we spent""",7.0,Cheryl Lum,2018-11-26,"Not Verified |  San Francisco to Munich. First time my son and I decided to try flying in Premium Economy as we were flying with Lufthansa. In short, it isn't worth the money we spent. It was more comfortable than flying in Economy for the extra legroom, but it's nothing special. Differences between Economy and PE are that the meals are served on chinaware and one sits 55 plus rows in front of Economy, there is a complimentary bottle of water included as well as a small amenity kit with typical items. The kit has 'Cerruti 1861' on it not Lufthansa and was just okay. They serve a pre-flight drink (only orange juice) which I think should be varied. The drinks they serve with snacks or with meals are not individual mini wine bottles but from a large bottle. British Airways and Air France serve wine in individual mini bottles so prefer that better. The service was fine. We had very friendly flight attendants both on the outbound and inbound flights. Food was tasty. However, there are just two choices: Meat dish or pasta. And the portions are as small as a frozen meal. Everything was tiny from the tray to the chinaware. Bread rolls were at least warm but again tiny. The flight attendants put out snacks in the galley but one had to either know beforehand to expect them or just happen to walk past the toilets then notice them as there was no announcement made nor on the menu they handed out. However, the choices were either crackers, Lindt chocolates, and juices and water. Seating as mentioned above is roomy for legroom and a tiny bit widthwise. I found it problematic to recline. In fact, I could not figure out how to do so. And the tray table is folded so it is a bit of a nuisance to unfold and fold it back into the arm rest. If I weren't sitting next to my son I'd need to ask my seat mate if I could disturb them as this tray table folding/unfolding experience necessitated bothering one's seat mate's arm rest too. Worst part of the experience is that the toilets were only two for the entire PE section and they were filthy. Plus the crew seem to be stingy on toilet roll replacing. In fact, they only have one toilet roll from the beginning of the flight. Sometimes it ran out with no replacement timely. Also hand soap ran out and it took some time for them to refill it. I've flown British Airways and Air France which have bad aspects, however, at least their flight attendants were always replacing missing toiletry items regularly during the long flight. This was a connecting flight between Munich and Rome. Hated that we were not told that upon arrival in Rome we'd be landing on the tarmac and would need to take a shuttle bus to the terminal. It was cold and windy and frankly hard to maneuver the steps from the plane for me. Would hate to have an infant and/or small children in tow. All in all, I'd have to think hard if I want to spend another $2K for Lufthansa's PE in future. I just didn't feel it was worthwhile as it was not much different from sitting in Economy. In fact, they make it known that you're really in Economy as you have no special boarding privileges either; you enter with all of the Economy passengers.",A380-800,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,San Francisco to Munich,2018-11-01,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2,yes,San Francisco,Munich,lufthansa

The inflight entertainment system on the trans-Atlantic flights had a decent selection of movies and music, but my screen kept freezing and crashing, and had to be reset, on both long-haul flights. The food on the EWR-FRA segment was okay, but the chicken meal on the FRA-EWR flight was absolutely horrible. Decent bar service on both long-hauls though. The European flights offered a sandwich with beer/wine/soft drinks, few airlines offer any complimentary service on short-haul flights, so that was nice. My biggest complaint would be that en-route to Kiev, my suitcase was destroyed at Frankfurt airport so I had to buy a new one upon arrival in Kiev. Also, my VIE-FRA connection was too short to be comfortable, 45 minutes to connect at a huge airport like Frankfurt is really stressful.

Overall, I'd still fly LH again, they're still better than any USA-based airline, as well as better than many European ones, but as a supposed 5-star carrier, they really need to improve the food on long-haul flights, work out the glitches in the entertainment system, and take better care of passengers' luggage.",Boeing 747-800,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Kiev Boryspil/Vienna via Frankfurt,2018-08-01,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3,yes,Newark,Kiev Boryspil/Vienna ,lufthansa

"""the queue is super long""",1.0,G Zhang,2018-07-31,"✅ Trip Verified |  I intended to take a flight from Basel to Munich and transfer to another one to Split. The original transfer time was one hour and forty minutes, which is more than enough. However, the boarding time was delayed twice as I was waiting in Basel airport and the final estimated transfer time is only 25 minutes. So I asked the front desk what should I do in order to catch my second plane, and she  couldn't give a useful answer, saying you should be able to catch it. As I got on board, I asked the crew several times about whether there is a fast track for transfer and whether they have further information about my second device. All the feedback I got was ""I couldn't give any information"" and ""sorry we don't have the device to check"". By the time I get off the plane, I still have five minutes to catch up. However, I have to take the shuttle bus and across the gate control. This is simply no way for me to speed up. I ran  but was still ten minutes late for my second flight. So I have to go to the service center for the rebook. But the queue is super long. They only open up to 5 desks to serve hundreds of people.  And the officials didn't even provide a place to live or a decent dinner as a compromise. This isn't my first experience of a tight transfer so I do have some example to compare. I remember when I took a Swiss airline from Beijing to Zurich, the plane was late due to frost for two hours. However, during the flight we kept get updated information from the crew. And as soon as I arrived at the Zurich airport, there are officials guiding us how to go and the transfer was really fast. Eventually everyone was happy about it.

SQ seats (due to the lower leg support and the foam in the seat itself) is in my opinion more comfy. And the noise cancelling headphones in SQ make a difference. The crew was friendly, personable and efficient. They were just let down by what LH was supplying. The DUS-FRA flight was cancelled via email/sms 5hours prior. Upon arriving at DUS to see what alternatives were available as nothing had yet been listed in the LH App and LH disconnected my attempted phone call 5 times whilst in waiting queue, they were most apologetic and had our complimentary replacement ICE High Speed train tickets to Frankfurt printed out and ready to go, along with a time table, within 10mins, which was much appreciated. The LH only check-in located directly upstairs from the FRA airport train station was also handy.

The plane was a brand new A350-900. A mattress has been provided and a Pyjama that made the flight very comfortable. The entertainment was massively improved: at least twice as much movies and programs have been added to system, that contains interactive maps. Last but not least, and which is most important was the crew. The crew was not only very professional (which is state of the art @ Lufthansa) but attentive. Even though the level of Singapore Airlines or Emirates is not reached yet but the Lufthansa crew kept taking care of the passengers the whole flight.

"""FAs were very good""",10.0,C Dawes,2018-07-16,"✅ Trip Verified | Victoria-Vancouver-Frankfurt-Geneva on 24 April 2018, returning 10 May. Economy class booked through Lufthansa website, with advance seat selection. YVR-FRA 10-hour intercontinental segments were mainline LH flights using Boeing 747-400s. YYJ-YVR 20-minute connecting flights by Air Canada used Dash 8-Q400 turboprops. FRA-GVA 1¼-hour connecting flights were an A-319 and a CRJ-700. I customarily book in Lufthansa's Premium Economy, but their 747s have only four rows of seats and the only PE seats left were in the front bulkhead row, which aren't worth the cost. (In that front row, although you have extra knee room, you can't stretch out your legs fully because there are no seats in front of you.) As well, in the armrest you have not only the tray table but also the IFE screen, which is half the size of screens in other PE seats. So I booked regular economy class. My seats were 49A outbound and 48K on the return. Booking those window seats cost Can$49 each way and were worth it, as they let you stretch out your legs fully under the seat in front of you. FAs were very good. Two meals were served, the main one after take-off, the second 90 minutes before landing. The meals were LH's two standard economy stodge options – vegetarian pasta or chicken. The second meal was an omelette before midday arrival at FRA, and beef stew or pasta before afternoon arrival at YVR. Connections as offered on LH website were tight, about two hours each way through FRA. Nevertheless, my luggage arrived with me both times. The only hitch was that LH and AC use different booking codes. After booking my trip on the LH website I had to telephone LH to ask for the Air Canada booking code, which I needed in order to do the initial check-in at YYJ.","Dash 8-Q400, Boeing 747-400, CRJ-700, A319",Business,Economy Class,Victoria to Geneva via Vancouver-Frankfurt ,2018-04-01,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4,yes,Victoria,Geneva ,lufthansa

While Miles&More Senators/HON and Lufthansa Business Class customers are allowed to use the DB Lounge at Cologne Central Station, this service is not provided to Star Alliance Gold customers. Still, I find the 50-minutes train ride from downtown Cologne to Frankfurt a very convenient alternative compared to flying. What I do not like is that there are no check-in agents at Cologne Station anymore – they have been replaced by a check-in machine. So it is not possible to make changes to the ticket: No change of flights, seats, frequent traveller card or APIS when flying to the US. Security at Frankfurt was very quick and I went directly to the lounge closest to my departure gate in the A terminal (A30). It was a business class lounge and had a really good selection of food and I nice tarmac view. It even had showers (which I did not use). I found it better that the Senator Lounges. The flight from FRA to CPH was fully booked in Economy, so no free middle seat. Nice crew, a bite to eat and two drink services (1h15m flight!). All in all a good experience.

"""Worst A380 layout I have flown""",4.0,Sid Vinyard,2018-06-28,"✅ Trip Verified |  Houston to Moscow via Frankfurt. Worst A380 layout I have flown. LH management should compare layouts of Singapore, Emirates, Qatar, Etihad, Korean, Thai, or even the 777's of EVA, ANA, Asiana etc. All are superior. Have not flown LH since my last Business class A380 experience a few years ago. Seats did not lay flat, so you constantly had to push yourself up from the foot rest. Fell victim to advertising that the new seats lay 180 degree flat, but I won't return. LH uses a 2x2x2 layout, rather than a far superior 1x2x1 of other5 Star Airlines. EVA & others offer 1x2x1 on their 777's. Seats on the LH A380 are the most narrow of any A380 I've flown. Tiny foot space. No privacy dividers between seats, unlike most 5 Star airlines, so it is a crowded feeling. Seats are low back, so you can view the TV screens of every other passenger if you are in the rear of business class. Very distracting. Do not understand why LH consistently fails to select high quality seating? Seat controls are on top of the arm rests, so if you lower your seat to sleep, you must crawl ""up out of the hole"" to make adjustments. Who thought this was a good design feature? Inflight personnel offer professional service, but are let-down by poor catering & cleaning. On the IAH/FRA segment I was seated in 2nd row of Business & 3rd row on the FRA/IAH return, yet on both flights there was NO entrée selection when the flight attendant came to take the meal orders. Catering had apparently failed to properly cater the flight in both directions, so there was zero meal selection. You just had to take whatever they had boarded. The printed menu is another joke. There is NO consistency to LH's printed menu, & the food you may receive. On the FRA/IAH segment the menu listed ""traditional Italian ice creams"". What was served was yogurt with granola. Is this another mistake by catering? The cleaning crew in Frankfurt could use updated training. Side business class storage compartments were filled with assorted trash. LH has also totally given up on any pretense of offering a quality amenity bag. Worst of any business class flight I have flown. Also agree with several other reviews that LH should be sued for ""false advertising"" regarding their non-existent business class service on many shorter routes. On many routes their business class is nothing more than the same seating in coach - 3 across with the middle seat being unoccupied. No added leg-room or amenities. The LH Business class lounge at FRA is mediocre at best. For breakfast there were no pastries offered. Just some powdered eggs, selection of cold cuts & cheese, & some cold hard bread. This is LH's top offering to Business class passengers? Wewill stay with Asian & Middle Eastern Airlines for our long haul International travel whenever possible. I will say LH is better than UA, AA & DL, but that is nothing to brag about. At least the flight crew kept the bathroom clean & tidy. Waited 40 minutes for our bags upon IAH arrival.

"""definitely recommend Lufthansa""",9.0,H Thorgen,2018-06-08,"✅ Trip Verified |  One of the best airlines I have flown. I started my journey in Seattle and travelled to Zurich via Frankfurt, Germany. I had flown with them a couple of times before, all positive experiences, and I was looking up to my flights. The ground staff were excellent, although I was a little disappointed to find out that Seattle Airport doesn’t offer any bag wrapping options. The ground staff was very friendly and helpful. After I checked in my bag, I headed to the lounge. Although it was crowded and not Lufthansa’s own lounge, it was a great lounge. The seats were very comfy, WI-FI was fast, food was good, and the staff was very friendly. Boarding started on time and in the correct order. Boarding went very smooth, and as soon as I boarded, I was welcomed to the purser. The food was great and seat very comfortable. I slept great and enjoyed my meals. Lufthansa’s staff is outstanding. A man sitting next to me was very inpatient and kept complain about the fact that the person behind him got his meal first even though he had a higher status. I would have already stopped serving, but the crew kept smiling and putting up with his moaning. My flight was great and I would definitely recommend it. After I landed in Frankfurt, I had a 4 hour layover until my connection to Zurich, but it went great and very smooth. As I was very tired, I headed to the lounge to rest, but after the lounge staff saw I was almost sleeping in my seat, they offered me a bedroom with a shower. The bed was perfect and the room looked like a 4-star hotel. The shower was outstanding and I was impressed with the service. After my rest, I headed to my connecting flight to Zurich. This flight also went very smooth and the food was great. After I landed, I accidentally forgot my iPhone on the plane, but before I had even noticed I left it, the flight attendant came running through the terminal to give it to me, I was amazed. My bag was the first one to come out in the baggage claim, which was very nice.

Unfortunately this aircraft was not prepared for Lufthansa Inflight Entertainment like the most aircrafts of Lufhansa, so it was not possible to use the Lufthansa App that provides several entertainment options. I am really disappointed about the seats. The seat was too thin and too short. All Lufthansa singlle aisle aircrafts have this type of seats. This was not a pleasure as the flight take 2 hours and 30 minutes and I had some pain at the lower back area and thigs. I guess for a shorter flight the seat is ok, but for flight of more than 2 hours it can be very unconfotable to sit on such a seat. The menu/food was ok, the tast more bland than nice. I expect more from a 5 star airline, especaially in business class! There was only one choise of coffee, filter coffee. No further coffees available like espresso or cappuccino other airlines offer in business class and same typ of aircraft, single aisle. And the service has been done with foof and beverages trollies, this is fine but at some shorter flights within Europe Lufthansa has a signature service.

Loading an almost full A380 with discipline and courtesy is a commendable accomplishment. We were delayed 15 minutes at departure, but we recovered the time in-flight and landed several minutes early. The flight attendant serving our part of the cabin was efficient, proactive, and friendly. The dinner served was elaborate and delicious. The veal and asparagus would have presented a challenge if we had been using plastic cutlery, but silverware did the job handily. I remember feeling that the seat was somewhat narrow in the flat-bed configuration, but I promptly dozed off and slept soundly for five hours. I must have been mistaken about the seat. With all the horror stories about lost luggage published here on Skytrax, I was apprehensive about my suitcase double connecting in Newark and Munich, but Lufthansa (and United) did their job and my case arrived promptly and intact. I had made a special request of Lufthansa by mail ahead of the flight. All correspondence was handled courteously and professionally. Many reviewers here tell bitter tales of frustration dealing with the customer service departments of other airlines, but I could not be more pleased with how LH handled my request.

Cabin crew introduced herself to me (bad sign) and kindly forewarned me that as I was in seat 1C, there would be a bassinet in front of me, and offered me a choice of seat change. Eventually was in Seat 7D. The A350-900 version 1 by LH has 2 business class cabins, the one most fore is a self-enclosed area bounded by the toilets and galley in the rear, but this area has bassinet fixing positions. The second area is aft of the toilets and galley and separated by a partition from the premium economy section, this area has less seats but you are more likely to be bothered by toilet and galley noise, if that is important. This area does not have bassinet fixing positions. The modern seat was as efficient and high-tech as before, really simple to adjust your seat to achieve a variety of positions including lie flat. Service was more friendly this time, though also with a Germanic reserve (none the worse for that!). Dinner was served shortly after departure, and was pleasant enough fare. Overall cabin ambience was good enough to achieve a fairly comfortable sleep, and awoke for breakfast - which was really not deserving of the term, it was the first time I ever managed not to eat scrambled eggs and cheese at 40,000 feet!

Service throughout was efficient but lacking the warmth and friendliness of Asian airlines. Food for dinner was served on departure and the menu looked good.

Short flight HAJ to FRA as usual, in time, small snack, nothing special, but its just 40 mins in the air. FRA-MIA on A380 premium economy. Thats very good value for money.

They serve two meals on that flights, both of them have beem surprisingly good. Beverage selection and IFE have been good as well. Staff helpful, friendly and professional. Flight was on time. On the way back from Atlanta it was an A340, cabin was not clearly seperate from eco class, but seats and food have the same comfort as on the A380. Flight was also on time. The only negative thing was that both flights have been heavily overbooked. On the way to US they announce at the gate that every business class traveller which would downgrade to premium economy would get 800 Euro. So far so good, but actually the rate difference was 900 Euro per way (at least what I got offered). On the way back they offered all passengers at check in which volunteer to fly next day 800 USD.

However we had no friendly welcome at all at counter, neither information about lounge, gate whatsoever. Next passenger please! Neither a smiley welcome at gate, except from a Japanese attendant. Also boarding was slow and lacking information about slight delay.

"""served very professionally by crew""",9.0,Stefaan Meulders,2017-12-29,"✅ Trip Verified |  Frankfurt to Mexico. We connected in Frankfurt from a flight coming from Brussels, disembarking this flight we were met by a driver who took us with a Mercedes to the exit nearest to the First Class Terminal. We had to exit the airport and walk about 200 meters; alternatively we could have used a First Class lounge in the airport but we preferred the First Class Terminal. The First Class Terminalwas a good choice as it is just fabulous. I also had sufficient time to take a shower (accompanied with a First Class Terminal duck). About 20 minutes before departure an agent took us to the Mercedes that drove us directly to the plane. With a dedicated elevator we went up close to the first class entrance of the plane. Seating in the nose of the Boeing 747-8i is very spacious and comfortable. The seat converts into a flat bed and you can raise a privacy screen. Soon after takeoff caviar was served which is one of the highlights of a Lufthansa first class flight. Soon some appetizers were served followed by the main course. There were 4 options for the main course; duck (which I’m not fond of), a beef stew (also not my favourite), a vegetarian option (pappardelle) or fish. Since fish was the only option I was attracted to I took it. The fish was ‘loup de mer’, presentation was rather uninspired and the taste was extremely salt. Luckily the cheese and dessert trolley had some very good options and all was served very professionally by the crew which was one of the best and most dedicated I ever had. Champagnes and wines were not the most well renowned names as with some other airlines but the quality was extremely good and typical for the regions/varieties. Just before landing the crew came to say us goodbye personally. We landed on time in MEX and were welcomed by a Lufthansa representative holding a board with our names. The representative took us directly to the diplomatic passport immigration desks. Next we went to the luggage belt where our HON labelled luggage was already standing in front of the belt. This was really amazing; from getting out of the aeroplane to getting out of the airport with our luggage took us only a couple of minutes. This was the fastest I ever went through immigration.

There might have been a problem for people with checked-in luggage or people who wanted to check in at the airport. The flight itself was the best I have had so far.

"""experience was frustrating""",2.0,G Wang,2017-10-17,"✅ Verified Review |  Athens to Vancouver via Munich. Despite the comfortable seat and good inflight entertainment in premium economy from Munich to Vancouver, our experience was frustrating, flat out disappointing. We could not check in one of 4 travelers online under one booking. Error messages such as unfortunately you are unable to check in online, your name, ticket number etc may be incorrect, and your routing does not match your ticket. Error messages were different every time we tried so you didn’t know what exactly was the reason. We were questioning whether he even had a ticket. Called customer service multiple times only for them to tell us to call tech support which was not open 24/7. We had to wait. Tech support advised that passenger was selected randomly to manually check in at the airport. Had that message shown at online check in, it would have avoided some undue stress and costly int’l roaming charges for calls. Original gate from ATH-MUN was rather close to our MUN-YVR, however we needed all the time we could get to go through exit customs since my mother in law is unable to run. On arrival, the gate of the current flight had changed, and it could not have been father away from our connecting fight. Boarding an A330 MUN-YVR was a disaster. Other than frequent flyers/business class boarding first, it was general boarding for everyone all at once and this included wheelchair passengers. If you’re a seasoned traveler, you know boarding in an orderly fashion from the back of the aircraft to the front helps prevent backlogs. Passengers were backlogged on the jet bridge so that it piled up back to a short escalator that was available to passengers and their carry ons which most, if not all, used it. Safety issue here is that it bunched up people all the way to the bottom of the escalator where those getting off had no place to go. Upon arrival into YVR, we were advised our checked baggage did not make the connection in MUN and advised they will deliver our bags the following evening. They were not delivered as promised the following evening and delivered another 12 hours later the following morning. Total 40hrs.

The cabin is very nice and the seats are also very nice, good full-flat foot space as opposed to the A340-600. But, there are no USB jacks or charging - mind-blowing in a new aircraft type. Also, the entertainment system features a screen that has not met pixels and a navigation page that is dismal. Service was efficient if not warm. The food was really lousy for business class. Even a salad was terrible. The contrast with our outbound flight to Munich could not have been sharper. We connected from Athens in Frankfurt and our flight was 55 minutes late. There was no one at the gate or anywhere to direct us or to say if our flight was being held for us.

"""It was impossible to sleep""",1.0,T Girling,2017-09-14,"✅ Verified Review |  I booked Lufthansa Business Class because I needed to sleep en-route in a quiet environment.  I paid 67,000 Miles & More points for this supposedly restful, relaxing flight and I selected seat 1A on the lower deck of the 747-400 because it is supposedly a secluded area of the cabin. I discovered that two noisy young children were seated together in seats 1H and 1K, with their parents seated behind in 2H and 2K. The parents ignored them and left them to make as much noise as they wanted on the 11½ hour flight. They were loud and uncontrolled, and their laughing and shrieking lasted the entire journey, as did their playing with their overhead and angle-poise seat lights in the darkened cabin. It was impossible to sleep with this behaviour going on. Why does Lufthansa allow young children in long-haul Business Class? Why couldn’t the children have been seated one per row by the window with a parent to control them? Lufthansa is responsible for whom they allow into their aircraft cabins and for making informed decisions as to whether their behaviour would upset or disturb other premium passengers. On arrival at the Lufthansa lounge at Frankfurt  I was told that my flight LH936 to LCY had been cancelled. I went to the reception desk and they had no explanation for the cancelled flight and I had been moved to LH918 flying to LHR.

"""beverages were rarely offered""",7.0,L Kline,2017-09-12,"✅ Verified Review | Flight from Seattle to Frankfurt, start afternoon in SEA, arrival early morning in FRA, so it was a night flight. Unfortunately, aircraft was a Boeing, thus seats much narrower than in an Airbus. Flight on time and very calm - usual, very good Lufthansa standard. However, cabin staff was not very attentive and sometimes even rude. Beverages were only rarely offered, collection of garbage even more rare. During the night, cabin staff went through the cabin with beverage trays, but did not look carefully if some passengers might be awake and wishing something to drink. About 2 hours before landing, I asked a cabin attendant who passed by with a beverage tray whether she could pick off my garbage, i.e. three empty cups. She said that she is not allowed to put garbage on a tray with food products (which I know) and she had other guests to care for. She would be back later. I asked when as I was aware that they would soon have to start serving breakfast before landing, and she said ""soon"". I did not want to talk too much or too loudly as most other passengers slept, just wanted to know whether the next collection of garbage would happen after the breakfast, whether it would make sense to go to the washroom before without disturbing the distribution of breakfast etc. Had a flight with Air Canada from Frankfurt to Calgary three weeks earlier, and they offered beverages much more often, and they also collected garbage. It was my first time that I experienced rude Lufthansa cabin staff, but other airlines do offer beverages much more frequently during long-distance flights, and they also collect garbage more frequently. Breakfast: only savoury, omelette with roasted bacon and onions. I prefer a sweet breakfast and hoped to get some sort of German breakfast on a flight to Germany with a German airline: some bread, butter, jam, maybe cheese and sausage or even some yoghurt. I am aware that an airline cannot fully respond to all customers' wishes, but a choice between a Northern American breakfast and a continental (German) breakfast would have been highly appreciated. Why not offering two choices as they do with the warm dinner (pasta or chicken)? I still recommend and choose LH for short-distance flights within Europe. First because of Lufthansa's safety standards, second because I can cope with some kind of thirst during short flights.

Check-in was quick and easy, enough free seats to choose when you check in online 23 hours prior to departure. My luggage was too heavy (25.5 kgs instead of 23), but Lufthansa didn’t bother, which is a great plus. Inflight experience was good: great and sufficient meals, crew very attentive, caring and good interaction with passengers. Mixed experiences with inflight entertainment: on both flights the map didn’t work and the TV touchscreen was difficult to use (slow or no reaction). Choice of contets was good, though.

"""see passengers as real people""",9.0,Immanuel Lanzaderas,2017-05-26,"✅ Verified Review |  Budapest to Montreal via Munich. I was going to upgrade to Premium Economy, but reviews said it was pretty much the same seat and food as regular economy; so, I didn't. Online check-in was easy using the booking code, but there was no option to upgrade. To find that out, I had to go to a service counter in Munich. Flight out of Budapest was late, but staff were apologetic about it. Boarding process in Munich was a bit chaotic, since they did not inform passengers about the pre-boarding document check (which seems redundant, since they are not Customs, and we all already went through customs). Staff on the flight were friendly and attentive. They re-arranged seats for a couple with an infant, so that they could use the bassinet in the first row. The woman who gave up her seat got a voucher to use for duty free. These are really nice touches that show they see their passengers as real people with real needs. Alcohol selection was excellent: sparkling wine, wines, beers, liquors, and cognac for after the meal. The meal was fine. I liked the chicken, and the real cutlery. The entertainment system is worth choosing Lufthansa over other airlines that are offering less for within $200 of the the price. There were hundreds of movies to choose from - from many different cultures. The system was really responsive and quick. The screeN is at least 25% bigger than the ones on Air Canada, and it adjusts to more angles. USB plugs were easily accessible, right beside the screen.

"""great crews, great service""",8.0,Ben Lolley,2017-05-23,"✅ Verified Review |  Washington to Birmingham via Frankfurt. This was my first experience with Lufthansa, products I experienced were Economy on the A319-100 and Premium Economy on A340-300. I opted to fly with LH as they offered both the best price for the overall trip and the most favourable times to work with my journey plans. I had initially planned to fly Economy for the entirety of the journey; however, the additional cost for a premium economy seat was so minor that it made sense to elect for the premium option. I made the booking using the LH website initially, which was fine, but then opted to manage my booking using the mobile app. The app I found to be very cumbersome and slow. It took some navigating to make simple amendments like seat choices or adding API/visa data.  I didn't have hold baggage for this journey so my exposure to ground staff was minimal. The first leg of my journey commenced at BHX. The check in process proceeded without issue; however there was a slight delay with boarding, and we departed 30 minutes late. This made me nervous given that I was meeting a connecting flight, however the cabin crew were friendly, informed us of progress and connection plans at all times. I was seated in 10A, and exit row seat with ample leg room. We were offered a basic snack (marble cake) and a juice/coffee. Service was expedient and pleasant; which is how I would describe all of the flight. After landing at FRA I proceeded to my next flight. Unlike many airlines there aren't many ground perks for flying PE with LH. no lounge access, no priority boarding. The enhanced comfort offered on board however is more than worth the cost. The PE seats on the A340 were akin to retro business class seats. Wide, with built in IFE and tray table, with a foot stand (I was in 10A again). I had an end of aisle seat which meant I was not reclined in to. The catering option offered with PE is the same as economy, served on China and with metal cutlery and a glass. It doesn't sound much but it in fact makes the experience considerably more pleasant. We were allowed use of the business class lavatories which was nice given the economy toilets were a good 15 rows back. The cabin crew overall were friendly and helpful. They seemed cheerful and willing to do as much as they could to enhance your experience. For the flight back I elected to pay to use the IAD Lufthansa BC Lounge. It cost a mere $35 and was worth every penny... however, it lacked some of the comfort and grandure usually associated with lounges. As an economy passenger I wasn't particularly fussed but If I was a BC passenger paying a flexi fare (i.e. a lot of money) I'd have found the lounge to be understaffed, A little untidy, and lacking in food options. The return legs were almost identical to the outbound; same aircraft, same seats, same comfort, friendly crew. The food on this occasion was served in tins, but this can be overlooked. Again the crew offered use of the business class lavatories which I appreciated. Overall my first experiences with Lufthansa were good.

The captain kept passengers well-informed during the delay as we'd been on the aircraft for quite some time. En route, due to the significant delay we discovered we would miss our connection to DUB. Staff onboard kept everyone informed as many connecting flights would be affected. We did indeed miss the DUB flight but we were put up in an airport hotel overnight in FRA with dinner & breakfast provided. Impressively, we informed of this and the new flight arrangements a number of hours before landing into FRA. The next morning we were flown to Oslo and then onto Dublin with SAS (Star Alliance) as all FRA-DUB flights were fully booked for Easter weekend.

The Premium Economy on Lufthansa's B747-800 is strangely squeezed between a mini Economy cabin in the front and the main Economy cabin in the back.

The seating configuration is 2-4-2 (vs Economy 3-4-3). The seats are wide and recline well, but the foot rest is not well thought out for people over 180cm. The food is basically the same as economy, with an extra dish and served on real china and glasses (but Lufthansa's food offering is good in all classes anyway). Would I book it? Only if the price difference is minimal at booking. Best is to book the cheapest economy and ask for a 299 euro upgrade at checkin or gate in Frankfurt (which is a really good deal on very long flights).

For this flight, Lufthansa uses the standard A380. I sat in seat 11D (middle row) in the upper deck. The first thing you feel in boarding this aircraft is that Lufthansa is efficient, courteous and professional. The cabin is clean if not a bit bland, but overall has a comfortable feel to it. The configuration is a 2-2-2, so the middle row is the best bet, as each seat is an aisle. The seats are comfortable and are lay-flat. My only issue is that the controls for the seat are touch and therefore, if you are resting your arm on the armrest, you seat tends to ""readjust"" itself if you brush against the controls. In the lay flat position, the seats are typical of most airlines as they are not exceedly wide, like Singapore Airlines, and narrow for the footwell. One issue is that your feet land on a ledge on the bulkhead which has only a small divider between your feet and your neighbors. Often during the flight, I was awoken as my seatmate changed position and her feet brushed mine. A minor inconvenience, but for some may be too creepy. The service on the flight was very good, if not at the personal level of some of the Asian competitors.

"""staff very friendly and attentive""",7.0,M Kronz,2017-01-24,"✅ Verified Review |  We flew Lufthansa Business Class from Munich to Barcelona on January 8, 2017. Our flight was supposed to leave from Munich's new Terminal 2 satellite building so we arrived early to spend some time at the Star Alliance Schengen Business Lounge which turned out to be a nice experience (see my separate review). Munich right now is going through a phase of Siberian winter so we were prepared for delays, and the boarding time got rescheduled from 12:30 to 13:25 because ""your flight crew didn´t make it to the airport on time"". Funny, because everybody else did despite the snow. During that time the departure gate was changed four times and we ended up having to go back to landside Terminal 2 via the underground people mover to our final departure gate which was totally overcrowded. Boarding started ten minutes past scheduled time which is not a drama but a bit of information would have been nice, but wasn´t forthcoming. Boarding was swift but we then got bussed around the entire airport to a remote stand off Terminal 1 which LH doesn´t even use. Our A320 with sharklets looked brand-new but had apparently been standing around all night in the open and was covered in snow, so after being seated by our very friendly cabin crew the captain came on the interphone to tell us that ""winter has hit us full-blast"" (no explanation or apology for turning up late to work), and that it would take a few minutes to remove snow from the engine inlets and perform the de-icing. In fact we didn´t take off before 16:00, with no further information forthcoming from the flight crew. Obviously, delays are to be expected in the wintertime, but the lack of information is annoying. The flight itself was enjoyable and uneventful, and we landed in Barcelona around 17:30 with apologies for the delay from the flight crew. The Lufthansa cash upgrade from economy to business on European flights is worth the money in my opinion even if LH European business class is technically speaking a premium economy product. But the legroom is pretty good, the seats are quite comfortable and the free middle seat plus foldable armrest improve seating quality no end. The staff are very friendly and attentive, the food is surprisingly good and the hot bread rolls are a nice touch, china and metal cutlery are appreciated and they offer as many hot and cold drink services as you like, and the look of the cabin was new, neat and clean. Flight announcements were sufficient and comprehensible and came in four languages. All in all, I would recommend flying LH business class on European routes, and I would recommend that LH improve their ground services in MUC.",A321,Family Leisure,Business Class,Munich to Barcelona,2017-01-01,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4,yes,Munich,Barcelona,lufthansa

Lufthansa's Business Class product is looking jaded and mediocre and no longer feels like a premium experience.

The onboard service is good, the flight attendants well-trained and efficient. The wifi service was highly unreliable and the $20+ fee seems a rip-off when there are so many breaks in service.

This was our first time flying with Lufthansa for quite a few years, and overall we had an excellent journey. The A320 flight from Edinburgh in business class had seats in a 3x3 configuration with the middle seat empty, the seat pitch was fine for the short flight to Frankfurt. The crew were very good, using our names, and we had a lovely light meal with a couple of drinks. To JNB we were in the upstairs section of the 747-800 which has 36 seats, again the crew were very good, and the food service for a 22.00 departure wasn't rushed, and the choice of wine and food were excellent. The breakfast after a decent few hours of sleep was served an hour or so before landing, and again it offered a decent choice of food with good coffee. The return flights were every bit as good as the outbound, again the cabin crew were very good, introducing themselves when we were seated, and using our names whenever we talked. After a very nice dinner, and watching a couple of up to date films it was time to settle down for a few hours sleep. After another good breakfast we landed on time at Frankfurt, and then made our way to terminal B for our flight back to Edinburgh on another A320.

I had ordered a Special Meal ""Hindu meal"" (non-veg)"". What I got was a bland vegetarian meal for dinner and breakfast. The whole idea of ordering a Non-Vegetarian meal is to not get a Vegetarian Meal and not whatever the catering division decides so give me. It wasn't even Hindu or Asian in flavor! Why does Lufthansa bother to offer a specific Hindu Non-Veg Meal if in reality does not provide such a meal? The flight attendants were wonderful on board and did what they could. But they could only offer me yet another Non-Meat Pasta Meal because the other one offered was a Fish Meal which I do not eat at all.  The food was the same as in regular economy class only served on china. The snacks for a long haul international flight was the same packet of pretzels offered with the pre-dinner drink and nothing more! Not that many years ago Lufthansa offered sandwiches, cake and fresh fruit and other nice things for snack on in long haul flights even in economy class!

However, while travelling from Houston to Frankfurt, the air hostess was very rude to me. An air hostess asked me to switched seats so that a family could sit together. Because of this, I had to take my bag to the upper deck. Unfortunately, there was no space available in the overhead bin and the air hostess gave me a hard time. I felt as though it was my fault for agreeing to help out. My return flight to Tucson was even worse. Due to a delay, I missed my connection from Frankfurt to Houston. I had to wait in the customer support line for over 3 hours while they tried to figure out what to do. I was finally re-booked (UA 59) on a flight that left 26 hours later than my scheduled flight to Houston while I knew for a fact that there were seats available on flights that left to the United States from Frankfurt. I was given 30 euros worth of meal vouchers. They didn't give the passengers without a transit visa a proper lounge to rest in. Their exact words were: ""We will give you some blankets and pillows. Please sleep near the gates in Terminal B"". Due to fatigue, I failed to realize that I just had 1 hour at San Francisco to clear my customs and catch a connecting flight to Tucson.

"""experience is truly special""",10.0,Charles Walsh,2017-01-05,"✅ Verified Review |  Newark to Dusseldorf. Only through the grace of about a billion points was I able to snag a Newark to Dusseldorf reward flight to experience Lufthansa’s renowned First Class on my way to a final destination of Lisbon. I felt somewhat unworthy as I settled myself into my 2A open suite, however, I worked hard to maintain the requisite “I belong here” demeanor, unlike the fellow in front of me who danced in the aisle, champagne flute in hand, celebrating after his boss switched seats with him (boss relocating to Business). The A340-600 First Class cabin was full. I spent the first fifteen minutes sipping champagne, enjoying macadamia nuts, and playing with what seemed like several hundred seating variations from which to choose. Service, food and beverage was for the most part stellar although once it was ‘lights out’, our two attendants did somewhat of a disappearing act, although I’m sure they would have been prompt if I had rang for service. The dinner service was outstanding, caviar first course, followed by a trio of appetizers, lobster main, chocolate dessert, complimented with some excellent tasting wines, and all served course by course on a well-sized and nicely laid out dining table. An after-dinner aperitif coupled with a cappuccino (and a few more sweets thrown in for good measure) concluded a wonderful dining experience. Seats were promptly converted into comfortable looking beds with myself as the only hold-out. With privacy dividers raised, the group settled into a state of individual slumber. I chose to catch up on a few recent-run films through the night. A perfect photo-op of a sunrise appeared much too early, as did the perfectly prepared breakfast offering of smoked salmon and scrambled eggs, freshly squeezed orange juice and coffee.  Finishing my breakfast, I changed back into my streets in the very spacious and clean washroom. There was a noticeable lack of interaction with the flight crew. Except for the obligatory “Willkommen to, Danke für” announcements from the flight deck, nothing else was offered. Perhaps the pilots were feeling miffed with their airline, and working to rule, choosing not to associate with even the first class passengers as has apparently happened in the past. The Lufthansa First Class experience is truly special, and not only the in-flight portion, but the other touches such as personal escort from check-in, past security, and into the lounge, as well as the lounges themselves, the service and amenities offered on either continent. As I left the sanctity of the First Class section, a sense of claustrophobia overwhelmed me and I realized I was turning my nose up at Lufthansa Business Class! And, as I sat in TAP Business on my flight segment to Lisbon, with my all-on-one lunch tray crowding my thirty four inches of pitch, I reflected on how fortunate I was to have experienced the Lufthansa First Class product.

"""about the experience and the swag""",10.0,M Norton,2017-01-03,"✅ Verified Review |  New York to Milan via Frankfurt. Seat 1A in First class. This was a special trip to Northern Italy for Christmas with my extended family and an Aeroplan reward ticket. We left pretty close to on time and they made up time on the way over. As soon as we boarded, I changed into the pyjamas and settled in for the overnight flight. Champagne and macadamias arrived quickly and on the seat was the Rimowa amenity kit. Meal service was delicious from the amuse bouche, caviar, black pepper pasta and I think it was chocolate bread pudding, though I was so full I couldn't. The wonderful champagne, I had the old world red and a lovely port. The crew on board couldn't do enough for us yet it still felt really private with a full cabin. After dinner, they made up the bed with a comfy top and bottom duvet and I got almost 5 hours of sleep. Breakfast was fresh and wonderful, I ate light as I had a 6 hour connection in Frankfurt before flying to Milan. My favourite part of flying first on Lufthansa is the First Class Terminal in Frankfurt. This is a separate building with no gates attached. You walk out the main terminal doors and turn left and it's a five minute walk. Take the elevator up and they personally take care of you from then on. You can do this not only as a departing but as an arriving first class passenger too. The whole place is bar, they have a smoking room with, and I don't smoke them but my friends would love the cigars. Shower/bathrooms, private snooze rooms and comfy wing chairs and ottomans to sit and read a book. One of the three bathrooms has not only a shower but a full on soaker tub too. I booked it and read my book until my time came. Lufthansa understands that some of us still love to fly and it's about the experience and the swag. Sitting on the bath tub was another collectible Lufthansa First Class Terminal rubber ducky to add the collection. I had a delicious breakfast in the a la carte restaurant, the mimosas and long espressos were great too. It was Christmas after all and vacation. When time came to board they escorted me downstairs to a waiting limo (they have a fleet of Mercedes, Audi, BMW and Porsche vehicles from sedans to SUV's). They drive you across the tarmac to your next flight. I find it hard to fault Lufthansa these days, I like the whole experience in the air and on the ground. There are rumours that LH will discontinue first from North America, I hope not.

The food was the same as Economy (very average both ways even by Economy standards although printed on a different Premium Economy menu), shared the same stewards on board and at check-in and boarding there was no separate boarding queue for Premium Economy. Whilst these are not big issues at all I do feel that for paying twice the airfare they might have offered slightly more to differentiate it from Economy.

Going out was Air Canada (average, as usual); coming back from Madrid to Vancouver via Munich was Lufthansa. Lufthansa was just fine: the flight from Madrid to Munich unmemorable; but the flight from Munich to Vancouver was very good. Initially I had a whole row of four to myself, but before takeoff a man moved, and sat in the other second seat in, so I ended up with just one empty seat beside me, which was still nice. Service was prompt, professional and friendly. I always order a special meal on long flights, in order to get served first. Not because I'm greedy, but that way you are finished first and can use the still clean bathrooms and get settled to sleep before the lineups for the bathrooms start. Special meals are always a mystery, but this time I had ordered Asian Vegetarian, and it was really tasty; and I was very pleased. A delicious veg curry, plenty of fruit, some really good bread and cheese. Plenty juice and water offered throughout the flight, plus a weird tasting cookie at one point. Very comfy seat, 45G - with enough leg room for me. The film selection on the IFE was a bit dated; and no new films that appealed to me.

Inflight entertainment on the leg from FRA to TLV (and back) via customer-owned devices was good and worked well (uses onboard Wifi), but the actual selection of films was a bit mediocre. Music and newspapers were plenty, though. We had the seats in front of the emergency exit rows on the A321. The seats were good for economy class seats, although they did not recline (minor issue with economy seats in my opinion, since they do not recline far anyway) and were a bit less wide compared to the other seats. However, these are one of the few seats in a pair arrangement on the singe-aisle A321.

"""seats are narrow and tight""",5.0,L Davids,2016-07-20,"✅ Verified Review |  Flight from Hong Kong to Luxembourg via Frankfurt. First leg with Airbus A380-800, upper deck business cabin. I've had the 'pleasure' of flying Lufthansa Airbus A380-800 in economy cabin and it was a horrible experience, unfortunately flying with business is a similar experience. One of the worst business class cabins I've flown - seats are narrow and tight, if you do not get a window seat there's no storage space at all for anything (window seats come with additional storage space along the fuselage) so every time you have to get up and reach the overhead bin. Film selection is so-so, the only positive side are the noise cancelling headphones. Food was average at best, service was mixed - the flight attendant taking care of my section was great, smiling, friendly and speaking English. I've noticed that on numerous Lufthansa flights that cabin crew first of all has this cold business attitude and tends to speak German, even if you speak to them in English. The second leg was ok, with a typical short haul flight seat, space and service - nothing special worth mentioning. At that point I would also suggest to avoid travelling through Frankfurt as this airport is a disgrace with rude and puzzled personnel and long waiting lines.

The not so nice thing about Lufthansa is that being tight can quickly turn into being uptight with little wiggle room if a certain degree of flexibility is required. I was almost refused boarding because my return flight from Frankfurt to Singapore was booked for a date which happened to be beyond the extent of my 90 day visa-free stay period in the country. I understand that airlines have to adhere to the rules as stipulated by immigration laws, but ultimately the decision to allow me to board the flight rested with Lufthansa’s flight manager who proved to be stubborn and neither susceptible to reasoning nor my explanation that I was not intending to spend the 5 months in Singapore but would travel in the wider region. It took almost an hour of arguing back and forth with several Lufthansa representatives before I was finally issued a boarding pass.

"""PE well worth the extra cost""",9.0,Mark West,2016-06-12,"✅ Verified Review | Frankfurt to Addis Ababa with Lufthansa. The connection in FRA is laborious and involves lots of walking. I took a leisurely stroll directly from my arriving flight to the gate (stopping for a little shopping for around 10 minutes) and altogether it took almost an hour to navigate through the airport, the mono-rail, the security checks, the other security checks and then to the gate. That said, when I arrived at the gate, boarding had just been called so the timing was, in fact perfect. I am impressed with the number of people on the ground to assist you with the transit. It seems there are no end of red-jacketed people to see that you go in the right direction. The crew were very welcoming and bright. Before take off a welcome drink of minty orange juice was offered in plastic wine-style glasses. After take off menu cards were distributed and pre-dinner drinks offered. They commenced with the meal service a little while later but had to abandon it due to turbulence. A helpful announcement was made, apologising for the delay. Two choices of main course were offered which were served on china and with metal cutlery. Red or white wine was offered from a full size bottle with water (sparkling or still). I have a little gripe with the way the service is ordered as I have noticed that on every flight a refill of wine is not offered until just before the coffee service. I would like to be offered a second glass of wine with my meal. After coffee (quite a long while after) after-dinner drinks (Cognac or Baileys). I asked for a refill of coffee at this point – it came about 10 mins later. A chocolate was also offered. Prior to landing in Jeddah (refuelling and crew change) a small half-sandwich was offered (no choice) and this was followed by a glass of orange juice served from a tray. Another gripe is that there is no tidy-up of the cabin during the re-fuelling stop. There were vast numbers of strewn blankets, discarded cups and every conceivable wrapper strewn all across the cabin and they remained there for the rest of the flight to Addis. I don’t really understand why either the departing crew don’t do a once-over, or a cleaning crew pop on board to do a quick tidy while we were on the ground. Overall, I like the LH PE service.

I had to catch a connection in Munich and since our flight was delayed, I asked the attendant if she knew when we would now be landing. She glared at me and told me ""I should have listened to the announcement the captain made"" and walked away. To be clear, the announcement was inaudible, which is why I called her over for clarification. I was very polite and (I think) within my rights to ask a flight attendant such a simple question. Most of the attendants were cold and unfriendly, sometimes ignoring passengers.

The service was not good for Lufthansa. For example, one half of the section of the plane where I was sitting (at the back) received meal menus, but not the other half. The meals were reasonable, but the seat was narrow and the meal trays so small that it was difficult for me to eat without spilling anything. And the staff kept bumping the meal trolleys against my elbows as they passed. The plane was one of Lufthansa's new 747s and I expected the seats to be wider and more comfortable.

Find the seats very comfy and like the colour scheme. Was greeted by a friendly flight attendant on entering the aircraft. Shortly after that greeted by name by the purser. Welcome drink was served by your 'new' personal flight attendant. On this route LH has introduced the enhanced restaurant service. Guess it is a very nice new touch but it didn't work out at all on this flight. Seemed like it was the first time for the team as the purser kept telling them what to do and they seemed pretty overwhelmed with the additional work. Overwhelmed and stressed with a warm smile though. The restaurant service will probably be a nice addition once the crews are trained. Other than that it was another great flight experience. Have been a Senator with Lufthansa for almost 15 years. After some years if downgrading I am very happy to see how much they have improved their entire product.

Also, they seem too few, so queues build up after diner and before breakfast and landing, crowding the cabin and making it busy.

Two to three flight attendants took care of us on this 14 hour flight. The seat is comfortable and the footsie issue a lot of people complain about wasn't a big deal for me. The cabin layout is quite nice. However, it's difficult to leave your seat if your neighbour turned the seat fully flat and you happen to sit by the window.

As the plane attained altitude the woman in front of us changed her baby's diaper in the seat. The staff softly mentioned to her that changing should be done in the restrooms, and then proceeded to reward her behavior with a multitude of gifts for her two children. The children acted out, screaming and yelling, setting off the other children in the row during the entire flight. They were continually rewarded with extra attention from the flight attendants, while we struggled to get their attention for basic service. Surely five is too many young children too be in one row, making the flight a miserable experience for everyone seated around them. Lufthansa needs to disperse the children on any flight, so they don't constitute a critical mass of misery for all the paying passengers around them.

Shortly after take off menus were distributed, however, only to some of the economy class passenger. Also, there was no choice between food options later on. I know some passenger had a different menu. Crackers and drinks were served. I ordered water and tomato juice, but my juice was forgotten and I was left with only salt and pepper until I had to remind the FA. Approxmately 3hrs after take off dinner was served.

"""service very kind and attentive""",10.0,H Severin,2015-10-03,"I flew Frankfurt to Buenos Aires in Lufthansa First Class at the end of August 2015. Before the flight, I visited the First Class Terminal. Having been there a few years before, it's amazing how Lufthansa keeps the service at such a high level. When the plane was ready to board, I was driven to the 747-8 with a Porsche Cayenne. First Class has eight seats, however, on this flight it was only one other passenger and myself. From the moment I boarded the plane, two flight attendants looked after us for the next 14 hours. The seat has to be the most comfortable on any plane these days. I sat on 2A, which is my favourite. Lufthansa did a really amazing job. The amenity kit might not be as luxurious as on other carriers, but it was good for me. They gave me a Pyjama from van Laack in which I could sleep. The food was superb and I was served several starters. One of the flight attendants offered to prepare another main dish if I didn't like the course I ordered. It was followed by desserts and pralines. The service was very kind and attentive without being intrusive.  IFE was great and had a fairly large selection of movies, tv shows, music and other things. When I was ready to sleep, the flight attendant made the bed on the seat behind me (3A). The bedding was almost as good as a regular one from home. They also put something like a mattress on the seat to make it more comfortable. I asked to be woken up two hours before landing in Buenos Aires and so I was.  On this flight, the purser came around three times to check on me and the other passenger. On arrival in Buenos Aires we were greeted by a representative who explained us how the immigration process works and told us that our luggage would be delivered to a dedicated luggage belt. I highly recommend Lufthansa First Class.

Be prepared to walk at lot at Frankfurt airport, especially if you need to switch from area B to area A. Although in the same terminal it takes easily 15-20 minutes.

"""new personalised long-haul Business Class""",10.0,Claus Madsen,2015-09-20,"Together with my wife, I experienced Lufthansa’s new personalised long-haul Business Class service on an A380 flight between Frankfurt and Los Angeles. Lufthansa’s ambition is to become Europe’s first five-star airline and measured by the new C-Class service concept, they will get there. The service was impeccable with the flight attendants competently managing the fine line between attentive and personal helpfulness and care – and well-meant, if imposing suffocation of passengers. Kudos to the cabin staff. The food was the well-tasting and delicious food, best I’ve had on a long-haul flight, wines were excellent too. The cabin was well-appointed, colours pleasant, and lots of space for your carry-on luggage. The IFE programme was impressive (but this has become an industry standard, I guess), including the large screens. The not-quite-so-new fully reclineable (‘lie-flat’) seats have been described by others. Since I’ve been flying on the South American services, which appeared to be the last to receive these ‘new’ seats, it was still a new experience for me. Hence a couple of words about the seats: they are certainly not bad. The foot-end is rather narrow – perhaps too narrow for comfort – and I don’t really understand the reasoning behind it. Space in general does not seem to be missing. Another minor issue is the compartment under the in-seat entertainment monitor. This is where you find your kit with socks, toiletries etc. In our case, you couldn’t close it properly, simply because it seemed to be poorly made (I’ve noticed it on a recent 747-8 flight, too). Flying on the world’s biggest and heaviest passenger plane and then not being able to shut a compartment box somehow feels silly.

Once in Munich, you have to walk to the ""H gates"" for flights to USA, which means you have to go through passport control. For my flight to Newark, you have to go through another security screening right near the gate, where you and your carry-on bag are thorougly searched.

Flying in seat 1A on the 747-8i from Frankfurt to New York was like sitting in a decked out BMW. Everything in the cabin exuded luxury and precise German engineering. The leather of the seat and the console. The seat movements were effortless. The table slid in and out from the side console without any resistance. It is a quality product. Even the details in the bathroom made it a pleasure to hang out there. Although the cabin has a very open feel, unlike the very private suites on Singapore Airlines or Emirates, there is a side panel that you can lift that creates enough privacy if you so desire it. The catering was superb, as was the service. European professionalism with class. Add to that the First Class Terminal in Frankfurt and the drop-off to the plane in a white Porsche, and you get a Top 3 global first class product. If I had to change one thing, it would be the video screen. It’s far too small for a product like this. It doesn’t do justice to the rest of the cabin.

The 747 had the new slim seats and the passenger in front of me had his seatback reclined the entire flight. The movie screen was so close to my face. The beverages were passed out in very small plastic glasses and rarely more than half full. One has to ask for 2-3 cups to get a healthy amount of fluids. The flight attendents hid behind the curtains much of the flight, discouraging passengers from walking in the aisles.

Unfortunately western food was horrible, it seemed old, no taste - crew did not accept that I switch to Japanese menu. Wine list as poor as on the way to KIX.

Lufthansa customer review,7.0,Michael Bucka,2015-07-27,"LH145 - 06/07/2015, A319. Easy boarding Process in Nuremberg, friendly staff on board. After arriving in Frankfurt, due to short connection, direct transfer with a limousine was already organized. LH440 - 06/07/2015, A380. Unfortunately when arriving at the gate to Houston, plane was delayed due to technical issues. Ground staff were confused, delayed the boarding twice. Boarding started about 45 min later than normal. Due to the amount of seats in business class, there were already 2 lines of about 40 people each for the boarding process. When boarding started the ground staff did that manually in only one line, without activating the two self service scanners. After 20 min I went to the purser and asked if she can assist me with boarding (First/Sen). She told me the boarding process had already started (sure, I was waiting there) and I can board after queuing in the line. After I asked why the scanners were not activated, she looked confused around and asked some colleagues, who then activated the scanners, which gave me the possibility to board. Unfortunately already a lot of people from Economy had boarded, which caused a delay on the stairs to the two bridges (First/Business and Economy). Overall my worst boarding process flying First with LH. Welcome on board was great, service and food thru the entire flight the same. Great people and a big thank you to the team of LH. The pilot could not catch up, so when we landed in Houston and the door opened, I had 10 minutes connection time to the boarding to TPA on C34.

Connecting in FRA extremely stressful (this airport is now worse than CDG), I had 60 mn to do it. It took 30 mins only to arrive at terminal, due to very very remote parking plus a lot of airplane traffic that stopped our bus. Then a long queue at Immigration, and very remote finger (Z62). Boarding had started when I arrived. Service on upper deck (FRA to KIX) was pleasant but slow, the food was delicious. Brand new flat seats, a bit too narrow, but pleasant anyway.

During the flight the flight attendants helped my mother with the food, something that I greatly appreciated. Upon arrival in Frankfurt we were met by very friendly and professional Lufthansa ground services personnel who escorted her and myself all the way to the Sheraton Airport hotel as there was a 12 hour wait between both flights and later came to the hotel to pick us up for our onward journey.

They serve a horrible roll after take off at 1am which was inedible. Seats quite uncomfortable. Headsets can hardly hear and this looked like a new aircraft. Crew was pleasant enough. Overall uneventful flight. Landed in MUC on time with a 40 minute connection and had to run for our next flight which we made with moments to spare.

Even though I used to prefer airlines with a stop-over we used LH direct flight due to the short travel time. The newly launched connection FRA-KUL is really worth the extra money. Lufthansa is clean, efficient and friendly. The seats were very comfortable, screen was big and food was ok. I slept for a straight 8hr and my wife slept 9.5hrs.

Breakfast served was okay and service was nice on this 3 hour flight. Got to FRA with a 2 hour connection. Had to get from one end of the terminal to the other and we kind of ran as we were a bit lost. Got to our gate and sat down to wait. After 30 minutes of waiting and near the boarding time I went to the desk to ask the status and was told we were delayed 3 hours. They did not tell passengers unless they asked and they never showed any change of timing on the information boards. LH then started handing out 5 euro meal vouchers- nothing in the canteen nearby was available to eat for 5 euros! Flight finally left 4 hours late and arrived at 5am in Mumbai instead of 1am.

Lufthansa customer review,8.0,T Eldem,2015-07-20,"Check-in and boarding were efficient. On board it was a fresh looking A330 with new Business Class seats. These are an improvement over the older angled seats but they are inferior to pods found on other carriers. In the fully flat position there is little space for your feet and overall, the seat is narrow. Flight left late due to congestion at FRA and arrived slightly behind schedule. The service was fairly attentive with FA's smiling throughout the flight. The appetizer was delicious but my lunch selection was overcooked and was quite bland. There were a wide selection of spirits and drinks to choose from and the wines served were fairly good. Pre-arrival meal was tasty and the portions were quite big. The IFE had a poor selection of movies and lacked in the number of new releases for both movies and music although the Bose noise-cancelling headphones were a nice touch.

Lufthansa customer review,7.0,Margot Love,2015-07-19,My original flight for my return to NZ was to Shanghai however due to Thunderstorms at Frankfurt the Paris flight was delayed and arrived an hour and a half late causing missed connection to Shanghai. Hope was given to us by the crew as they said everything was delayed and so we had a good chance but this was a false hope. On the Paris flight the English announcements were hard to hear as the sound was not turned up loud enough to overcome all those that had understood the German announcement and were now talking loudly. Attendants on Dubai flight were friendly and professional. There was mixed customer care when hundreds filed in to the customer service area. Some received overnight kits some received juice and water and some did not. The processing of people got faster when a second area opened up downstairs. Again mixed customer service. I got great service with all vouchers explained as well as clearly written on what was what as well as a meal voucher where as a lady I buddied up with didn't get as good service and no meal voucher. On return to Frankfurt airport the next day for rebooking great professional staff sorting out re ticketing of new flights. Accommodation was supplied in Frankfurt and also at layover on Dubai.

I agreed to pay the extra, was moved to my new seat and from then on my flying experience turned out to be one of the best I had ever had, it was brilliant, I felt that I was treated like a VIP.

Lufthansa customer review,1.0,Tan Eng Hui ,2015-07-16,"My family took a long haul flight with Lufthansa to Berlin via Frankfurt. They only give us a transit time of 1 hour 5 mins. By the time we came down from the plane at Frankfurt, I happened to look up at a clock in the airport, and it was already 20 minutes into the transit time. We walked to the gate, and it was a long walk. An airport staff member stopped the whole group of passengers from going down to the immigration clearing area, which we had to pass through before we can reach our gate for the connecting flight to Berlin. He just said the area downstairs was too crowded, so we cannot go down. He held us up for 10-15 mins. Finally, we were allowed to go down, and there were only 6 staff doing the immigration clearance (as compared to over ten in Heathrow airport). That takes another 10 minutes or so. In the end, we reached our gate 2 mins late, and the plane had left without us. After that, customer service was non-existent. This is no fault of ours. They could not put us onto the next few flights as they were all full. We were told to go to the gate to wait and enquire if any passengers didn't show up. We tried this for one flight, and I refused to do it again. The next available flight was 5 hours later. But we would have reached Berlin too late for us to take another connecting flight to London. I have booked this BA flight some 4 hours plus after our supposed arrival time in Berlin. Yet we had to miss it. To add to the insult, we were told we had to take the flight to Berlin, or they would re-calculate the total cost.

They changed to an aircraft fitted with Q suite, which is like flying first class. Due to the delay, business class cabin was quite full, but it didn't affect the high level of service. Welcome drinks, pyjama sets, toiletry bag and all. Due to the pandemic, there was no magazines or any reading materials. However, there were printed menu and wine list. Crew wear a face mask. Food was served course by course in generous portion, there was no signs of any cost cutting. Inflight wifi was fast and steady too, only cost USD10 for the entire flight. Qsuite is one of the very best business class seats in the current market. The door gives you an excellent level of privacy. Comfortable large seat with sufficient storage space and comfortable for sleeping position. Throughout the flight crew presence is good, very pro active, they always come around and see if anyone needs a drink or so. A truly wonderful 9 hours just flew by, a very smooth landing. Plane was parked on tarmac, we had to be bussed to the gate. Biz customers get their own bus. Connecting in Doha is a bliss, with security procedures simplified. Fantastic huge Al Mourjan lounge with nice shower facilities and plenty to eat and get a rest. Next flight was on their new 787, fitted with new seats that also come with individual doors! Once again, meal was delicious and plenty, same excellent service all the way to Vienna. It really was one of the top best flight experiences I've ever had, especially after having stayed put for 18 months.

After standing around for 10 minutes we noticed several people going to a separate line and being allowed through, turn out this was the line for business class. Onboard staff were very friendly and set up the Q-Suite for us. Service was prompt with welcome drinks served and orders taken for the meal. For some reason even though the flight departs at 01:45 Qatar serves a light supper instead of a breakfast option on arrival, chose the soup which was really good and then had one of the best sleeps ever on a plane.

While the experience of the flying economy was always great, flying business class takes it to a totally new level. I have flown business class with Emirates and American before, but none of them come even close to what Qatar offers. To start off, Qatar is the only airline that offers on-demand dining, it feels like I am in a 5-star restaurant, the food quality and the in-flight service are always superb, the staff both ground and in-flight are well trained and very professional. I am positive the business class experience in Qatar is better than most airlines first-class service. On my last flight, I chose a lobster dish for my dinner, I can honestly say it was better than any other lobster dish I have tried in many fancy restaurants. Last but not the least, the lounge at Doha airport is one of the best I have ever experienced, from the shower facility to the quality of the food, simply amazing.

As always, the QR experience was top notch. The QSuite and bedding were extremely comfortable, food very good, wine list outstanding and cabin crew service exemplary.

"""About as good as it gets in Economy""",9.0,Anders Pedersen,2021-08-23,"✅ Trip Verified | Award ticket from KGL to CPH via EBB and DOH on 18/8-2021. Thought I could upgrade from Economy to Business, but their Privilege Club is further degrading and has abolished that option. Nowadays, it is almost impossible to pay and book online due to increased security causing it to be a several days’ project to issue a ticket. Award tickets cannot be booked without instantly paying taxes. And, online payments could not be effected from Rwanda due to code/country problems to receive OTP. Thus, even temporarily bookings can’t be made unless done directly by QR over phone at higher fares and lots of troubles involving use of other people’s credit cards. Check-In in Kigali easy, though must be in Airport 4 hours prior to departure due to Corona prevention measures. Granted Lounge access to Pearl lounge which is acceptable. Must pay for luxury beverages. But a variety of hot food and snacks offered makes up for it. All flights on B-787-8. Long haul Economy Class QR is top notch and matches economy+ on other airlines. They have improved economy class services since I travelled with them last time; 18 months ago. FAs are attentive and extremely concerned of elite travellers like myself – I have a fainting Gold Card, but was addressed by name throughout I was given the best seats possible in economy among options provided. Drinks were offered frequently. Call bells responded to quickly. Three choices of hot food on every long leg: plenty of it, and I got more if requested. No seafood, mutton, fish or exotic meat offered. English breakfast without bacon? Salads average and desserts were excellent. Sparkling wine (Cava) and wines. Beers offered are still embarrassing: only two, similar, dull lagers offered: Stella Artois and Budweiser – Heineken has gone but that does not add to the repertoire, anyway. The leg DOH-CPH offered two meal rounds. First, a Champagne brunch (3 meal options). Then, a heavy sandwich prior to descend. I was given 3 seats through seat-block for elite travellers. FFP-lounges in Doha are temporarily upgraded to become the Al Mourjan - even for economy travelers with card status. In CPH my luggage came out as the first. A pleasant travel.

"""customer support is very poor""",5.0,D Tanede,2021-08-03,"✅ Trip Verified |  Qatar airways offer on paper great value, sadly for us their customer support is very poor. The reservations system is clumsy and full of frustrating redundancies in terms of data input. You need to re-enter country of residence and nationality at payment time despite having done that already for the booking.  The problems arise when there is a bug and it becomes unavoidable to deal with a human operator. And this is where the nightmare starts. The operators, while usually courteous, are unable to do anything useful. In our case, they kept telling us there was nothing wrong with our corrupt data. In one instance, calling the Swiss desk, my call was broken and they would hang it up as we tried to call back. The Doha call center was easier to talk to, but they could not see, let alone fix the data problems. They made us believe that problems would be fixed at check-in or at the transit desk. Upon reaching the Doha stopover around midnight, we got kicked around from desk to desk (transit, to lounge, to ticketing, to upgrade before you fly. And at every stop,  ""we can't help you here, but no worries, your solution is at the next stop"". Nobody did the right thing when a system error is causing additional cost or reduced opportunity. On our previous trip, we checked-in to the Doha Al-Mourjan lounge with two paid up vouchers of which one was mysteriously not showing in their system. They treated us like suspects of having forged the voucher, it took 45 minutes of misery at 1 AM, with them absolutely refusing to let us take a rest while they investigated the bug, despite us offering them to take a debit on our credit card as a safety.  On the latest flight with them, we spent a night in Doha on a chair in a crowded, noisy hall because of the bug that prevented us for 10 days from booking the lounge which was part of planning this trip.

The inflight meals were really good, I had three options to choose from both of my flights. On the Boston- Doha, they served 4 meals consisting of dinner, 2 hot snacks and 1 breakfast. The crew was really nice and friendly, they made sure everyone had a good time. Qatar airways also offers wifi where for 60 minutes every passenger gets it for free and if you want for your whole journey, you can pay 10$ which is a pretty cheap deal compared to Emirates that charges more.

We are glad that we chose Qatar Airways who made us feel safe and relieved. Transfer desk staff at Montreal were friendly and helpful in sorting out some last minute challenges on travel clearance. They gave us a meal voucher since all business class lounges were closed in Montreal airport. Boarding was streamlined to ensure social distance. Upon boarding the crew introduced and explained the cabin features. The amenity kid, COVID PPE kit, duvet were all ready at the seat and the crew offered the pyjamas. We chose the refreshing lemon mint signature drink prior to take off. The Qsuite is truly a first class business class suite with great comfort and privacy, could not ask for anything more. The couple suite rear facing was great offering us more personal space with the divider removed. The beverage and meal service was prompt and on demand. We miss the trolley service where you get to choose the options and appreciate the presentation but that is understandable during COVID times. One of the cabin crew was convincing my wife hard to have the breakfast since she skipped the dinner service. The crew wear their full PPE including gown and safety glasses and the passengers are required to wear masks at all times. The washrooms were kept clean at all times, however I felt the A350 washrooms bit smaller than the B777 ones. The transit experience in Hamad airport was smooth and refreshing. The 3 hours went by quick with shower facilities, spacious seating options and dining options on the upper level.

"""I was impressed all round by the carrier""",10.0,Nicholas Hathaway,2021-03-22,"✅ Trip Verified |  My wife and I travelled back to the UK from Thailand on 18th March 2021. We checked in at the Qatar Airways desk about 4 hours before departure, and we very thankful that we had got to the airport so early as all our documents for the return trip, i.e. Certificate of a Negative Covid Test, the UK government's Passenger Locator Form, and the receipt for the two obligatory Covid tests that are required by the UK government when in self-isolation within the UK, were meticulously checked by check-in staff, the whole process taking 25 minutes. Boarding the aircraft at Bangkok was the most professional and well controlled that I have ever experienced at Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi Airport; whereas they normally descend into chaos as soon as boarding is announced. My wife and I were pleasantly surprised by the modernity and cleanliness of the aircraft that we boarded, everything we needed for the flight, e.g. facemasks, hand cleanser, ear plugs etc were all neatly arranged in the seat pockets in front of us. The cabin crew were very smartly dressed and neatly turned out, and they were very polite, attentive and visibly present throughout the whole flight. The in-flight meals were of the very highest standard, and probably the best that I have ever been served on a flight back to the London. We arrived in Doha on schedule, and boarded flight at the correct time and the boarding was conducted with the same proficient manner as out first flight.

They had a flight a few hours later which would not of been a problem. Qatar said she needed to go though ticket agency. ASAP did nothing to help and blamed it on Qatar. After trying for three weeks with is both paying hotel rooms they could not help since all their flights went though USA. I later checked with them about a flight and it is no problem going though Spain which was no problem. Canceled the trip and we both went home to separate countries. I will not use ASAP again and was able to get a refund from credit card company on her trip. Of course by then spending time, thousands of dollars and way to much stress. Never thought I would use Qatar again either. Another trip to Thailand and Qatar was the best deal and schedule so against my better judgment I tried them again. What a surprise.

The flight was uneventful which is how you want it. The service was exemplary, very attentive and the food was delicious with plenty of it. The seat although lie flat wasn't as comfortable as I was expecting and on the 14 hour flight I got somewhere between 2-3 hours of sleep. The in flight entertainment was average with few major movies available. We had three hours at Doha before catching our onward flight to Heathrow and we used most of the three hours in the spacious lounge refreshing ourselves. The onward flight was a repeat of the first flight, generally pleasant with the same caveats as before. Overall the onboard experience was very good. But what marred the flight was after we got to our isolation destination to find out an expensive electrical item had been badly damaged despite it being marked as fragile.

I went and sat down and called my family in Malaysia and told them about my situation and at the sane time going online to find out what the requirement was to enter Malaysia even though I’m a Malaysian citizen. Apparently, it’s a letter that I have to sign in order to undertake to pay for my quarantine in Malaysia (which didn’t apply to me as I was going home to my state of Sarawak and Sarawak would bear all my quarantine expenses since I’m a Sarawakian). My family advised me to call my cousin’s daughter who is an immigration officer in Kuala Lumpur. I was just about to call her when one of the gate agents called me back to the podium.

Better things still to come .. the transit to the flight to Madrid was achieved by simply walking to the departing gate without having to go through the hand luggage and passport checks again. The 8 hour flight to Madrid was in a A350-900 which was comfortable but the seat was less private. Everything was wonderful except the crew may have been just a tad over attentive.

However we managed to get on a UK charter flight to Manchester via Doha to Melbourne recently. This review should really cover the Manchester to Melbourne flight via Doha. We required wheelchair assistance and medical oxygen so it was not a straight forward flight. We have so many people to thank and especially Qatar Airlines which will be the subject of the review here. Customer service was excellent. Qatar Cyprus (Eleni) reached out to us to assist us. Qatar Airways waived all charges for changing the route completely. Once they approved the wheelchair and oxygen they swung into action, we had excellent assistance from Check in to boarding and then disembarking. We were told many times that they will take care of the medical needs by the cabin crew who checked on us frequently during the flight. At Doha, we were picked up and transported to the different gates effortlessly and efficiently and were allowed to stop to get some sandwiches We have nothing but the utmost praise for the cabin crew (Flights QR 28 and QR 904 11th May 2020) for looking after us. Safety due to virus From videos to cleaning the toilets frequently and wearing the appropriate safety gear, they kept us safe during the flight. It can't be easy on the cabin crew as they are exposed to passengers all the time so they are like frontline healthcare professionals. My deep respect for the cabin crews.

Generous baggage allowance of 30kg per passenger. Despite the minor issues of delays at check-in at Manchester Airport and some mild chaos at boarding (not due to Qatar Airways, and more Manchester Airport ground staff), I really enjoyed my first flights with Qatar Airways.

The flights however will be delayed and will use them in the next 12 months on another Qatar Airways Flight, if they decline my request for a refund. In all, a great experience.

Great novelty factor and the flight literally flew by (no pun intended). Food and drink are amazing, and the flights were simply not long enough to get through it all between London and Adelaide.

Sat on the window seats on the way home, as the one drawback of the centre seats is no individual air vents, which meant the cabin got stuffy. In the A350 900, the second, smaller cabin is better (almost empty, very quiet) and on the A350 1000, front cabin is better, as the rear one is closer to the galley and WC.

I know that if I fly a smaller A319 from Bucharest to Doha for example or an A380, 777 or A350 long haul, that the cabin crew will be just as polished and polite on each service and the aircraft turned out immaculately. I have flown Qatar in economy and Business, but I am yet to try their First Class product.

I am looking forward to flying on the A350-1000 in a few weeks time and will continue to fly Qatar where I can, for me they are the benchmark airline in the industry for onboard service.

The entire experience is always very calm and rather luxurious, even in economy, and the flight route (between Perth and London) is exceptionally fast.

The meals and wines were excellent and the FAs quietly attentive. The business class layout of the A350 is virtually identical to the Boeing 787 Qatar Airways used to fly on the Edinburgh route, but I found the Airbus generally quite a bit more comfortable.

That, plus the food and the large selection of films from that region gave the flights a distinctive South Asian vibe. Many of the passengers too appeared to be from the Subcontinent.

I got a few hours sleep and had an excellent breakfast. The plane after landing was parked at a remote location but an air conditioned bus arrived very promptly and it was dedicated for only biz class passengers. The transit time at Doha was a little over an hour and I did not feel I could make use of the lounge. The DOH-JFK leg was in the airline's vaunted Q-Suites. It felt very enclosed, though cozy. The cabin looked congested and crowded. A large collection of films were in the video library including several Hollywood classics. Meal service is on demand - something I don't care for. The menu list is extensive. Pajamas, sandals, and a toiletry kit were provided on this flight. On the shorter CCU-DOH flight only a toilet kit (a ""cheaper"" version) was on the seat. The biggest surprise was that Qatar airways has discontinued its in-flight duty free shopping, something I have always enjoyed about air travel. There is really nothing to fault on this airline except that on both occasions, the flight attendants had to be reminded to bring me my jacket on arrival which they were so eager to stow away when I boarded.

Decided to choose this carrier over other cheaper options due to oneWorld affiliation with Qantas, their reputation, their quality IFE, and ability to allocate our own seats without charge. Checkin was easy, although I hadn’t realised we could have used the Business Class counter with oneWorld Ruby status. Boarding is regimentally administered by zone. We chose the 2 abreast J/K seats on the A380 which requires walking the length of the main deck economy cabin the up the rear stairs. That small cabin at the rear of the upper deck was a good choice. Very quiet, and I like the extra storage space beside the K seat. We received a good blanket and pillow on both flights, plus a small amenity pack for the long overnight flight from SYD containing eyeshades, earplugs, sockettes, toothbrush and lip balm. Service was performed by the same crew member for the whole trip, same from Doha to Nice which I liked. The crew appeared very professional but our ladies were a little robotic. Food was adequate, with numerous drink and snack runs. I appreciated the attention to detail. Eg. asked for cranberry juice during one meal and when advised not available, was offered 3 other juice options which was fine by me. 10 minutes later, a cranberry juice was delivered. One annoying occurrence was when they changed us from 18K/19K to 19J/K from Doha, after we had been given boarding passes in Sydney. Not wanting a middle seat, the only alternative to a middle seat was an aisle further back. I think they fibbed telling us it was so a family could sit together. They weren’t in row 18.

"""staff make all the difference""",10.0,Megan Burnett,2019-08-03,"✅ Trip Verified |  Manchester to Auckland via Doha. I am a very nervous flier and the airline and the staff make all the difference. When booking Qatar airways was very decently priced and so I thought I would give them a go. So very pleased I did. Manchester - Doha I was given seat 37A - window exit seat. Which was VERY nice of the ground staff. They didn’t have to do this but I think the man could already see at check in that I was afraid. The seat was comfortable. I’m a fairly chubby lady, however I fit into the seat great and the seat belt and person next to me all was totally fine. The flight was a little bumpy but I was kept entertained by watching the cabin staff - watching them keep calm during turbulence stops me from being so scared. I didn’t eat during the flight as I find it too hard to eat during bumpy times as it worries me even more - silly I know, but. My passenger next to me however had a pack of pretzels soon as we took off, a chicken lunch around 1 hour after take off, then about 1 hour before arrival had a chicken pastry. There were drinks served at the same time. I had a gin - to calm nerves ;). Juice, water and Pepsi. Staff lovely. Had a lady from Ghana serving mostly. Arrived on time with smooth landing. Doha airport is massive  for those who have not ever been. Very nice ground staff at the gate. Doha to Auckland was even more bumpy. Constance low level turbulence with at times the seat belt signs coming on. Again on time landing despite leaving Doha around 20/30 mins late due to long take off queue at Doha (even at 2.30am). Breakfast was served about 1 hour after take off, then dinner around 5 hours. Snack box in between, a hot pastry in between and then  breakfast around 1 hour before arrival. I actually ate the second breakfast, I had the sausage and eggs. I ate the sausage but left the eggs and potatoes as not to my taste. Also had a coffee, orange juice, croissant, bag of apple slices and yogurt. Very good indeed. The flight attendant could see I wasn’t eating due to the bumpy conditions and kindly left me the snack box while I slept under my seat which had chocolate, granola bar, juice, pretzels etc. Furthermore, the flight attendants were absolutely lovely when I pressed the buzzer multiple times asking for water - again due to being afraid of flying I don’t like to stand up on flights. The cabin crew came around with boxes of popcorn / crisps during the flight as ‘movie snacks’. Such a nice touch!! Although i didn’t eat, the people next to me said the food was delicious. I can’t watch the tv whilst on the flight as I wear pressurising EarPods (I can’t hear anything at all). But the films were great; they had new films like dumbo live action & avengers endgame. Loads of games which I did play. As well as 1 hour free WiFi or WiFi for the whole flight for $10. Great connection much better than Emirates. For Emirates connection usually I can only access iMessage. However with Qatar I was able to go on Facebook, Snapchat and instagram with no issues at all. Probably on my flight home I will pay the $10 for my whole flight as it puts me at ease being able to talk to family and friends. Nice toiletries bag on the long flight with toothbrush, socks, eye mask, toothpaste and lip balm. The flight from U.K. to doha was 7 hrs while to Auckland was just over 16 hours.

On boarding we were offered a drink [White Champagne or Rose], cold towel and menus. One of the staff then asked what we would like to order to eat and drink and when would we like to eat. The food comes direct to you from the galley - no rattling trolley service so if other people want to sleep, you can eat and not disturb your fellow travellers. The food was always excellent in heat and presentation. With this system you can order as much or as little as you want. If you do not wish to sleep, on the A380 at the back of business class there is The Bar which serves mocktails, cocktails and Champagne, juice and snacks There a sofa with seatbelts for sitting and magazines if you wish to read.

"""Qsuite on the A350 is amazing""",10.0,Noreesha Ottali,2019-07-31,"✅ Trip Verified |  Considering the overall flying time from Muscat to Houston via Doha was 19 hours or so I was dreading to do it in an economy class flight. However do to pricing factors for a business class ticket, I transferred my amazing American Express membership reward points to my QA account and credited it with miles. After having done that I called up the call centre who said there weren't any seats available for miles. I was disappointed as  I had already transferred my amex points out by then. As my date of travel arrived, departed Muscat to Doha on economy I had a 2.5 hr transit in doha and felt like trying my luck at the customer service counter.  Unfortunately my hope for an upgrade via miles was not entertained by the lady stating I was not eligible. Not giving up i was directed by another  staff to head to the counter where the security checks were. One staff typed away on his system started making calls and told me theres just one seat available which only could be released after confirmation from his team which would just one hour prior to departure. Keeping my fingers crossed 10 minutes later he told me I was able to avail the upgrade! The efforts made by Ahmed were so remarkable that I insisted I raise this to the management that staff like this should be admired and rewarded for such excellent service and should be role models. The gesture made such a difference to the whole trip as the Qsuite on the A350 is an amazing experience and I think it's a better than even the A380 business having the double bed feel side by side to your partner is wonderful.

Inflight entertainment might be bit better, especially on A330 equipment where screens are old. I noticed the A330 had fewer lavatories. But what is absolutely the best when it comes to Qatar Airways are the meals and drinks. You have an outstanding choice of three main courses. Cold drinks served twice on ARN-DOH leg. And hot drinks also twice. Ability to select seats for free or ask (if you have a very short connection in Doha for example, to chose a front aisle seat). Boarding procedures were easy and simple.

"""the best of the best""",10.0,K Lee,2019-07-27,"✅ Trip Verified | I do not regret choosing Qatar Airways at all. Almost everything was the best of the best! I was also lucky enough to be able to fly Qsuite, which is easily the best way to travel. Check in at Bangkok Airport is quite a mess, due to the fact that there are four flights leaving simultaneously to Doha. The check in agent said that the Qatar Airways lounge in Bangkok is closed due to a cracked window. I was about to head to the JAL lounge when I noticed that the Qatar lounge was in fact, open and fully operational. This lounge was absolutely immaculate. They even had Bollinger champagne! There was a buffet service and most drinks were actually made on request to the staff. They were there to help you with everything. I think the staff to passenger ratio was 1:1. My favourite thing at this lounge has to be the Baklava. Qatar also has their lounge literally next door to their main competition, Singapore Airlines. Boarding was orderly on the outbound flights from Bangkok to Doha and Johannesburg, but on the return they instead asked economy passengers to board first, their reason being ""The cabin was not ready for business class passengers."" The good bits: Qsuite! We were a family of four, so we elected to have the first ""Quad"" seat which is essentially a conference room with closed doors! We were in our own private world up there. The seat/bed was super comfortable, although watch out for row two, as this row has slightly less foot space due to the angle of the cabin. There was a thin mattress cover provided and my mum and dad were even able to sleep together in the double bed! The regular 1-2-1 business class found on the A350 and B787 was also excellent. I would strongly suggest reserving row 7 on the A350, as you get two extra cubbies next to you for your belongings. Also located close but not too close to the toilets. The flat bed on these seats were also excellent, and there were endless seat adjustments. the ""bar"" on these planes was filled with snacks, fruit and champagne and most of the time there was a flight attendant waiting there to assist you. The service: I cannot emphasise this more, it surpassed all expectations I had set. Every single item was placed at your seat, no trays were used at all. The flight attendants were all friendly and professional. They seem to know the types of passengers very well and how to treat them. I had a cold on my return trip, and was constantly looked after. On one of the flights, a medical emergency was declared and the crew handled the situation very calmly and professionally. Once the flight landed there was already an ambulance waiting for the sick passenger. The food: Everything I tasted was excellent, and I took advantage of their dine on demand service by ordering a hot snack in the middle of the flight. I think my favourite meal was a Philly Cheesesteak which was very filling and the beef was very tender. They give every passenger (Including economy) 1 hour free wifi onboard! The Al Mourjan lounge in Doha: To call it huge is an understatement. This lounge is absolutely gigantic! You also had a personal tablet at every seat for information on the airport or flight information. Too bad everything is too spaced out. Given the fact that all airlines have their ups and downs, I would say that Qatar is an excellent airline and it shows in almost every way. I would certainly choose them because of their extensive network, but they haven't won me completely over.

There was no queue and complete in 5 minutes. I was given my boarding pass and advised to use for it for the fast track and Lounge. I headed to the lounge where I was greeted by a member of staff who seemed awkward. I was the first to arrive and i think caught them off guard. Quickly from a side door appeared a chap arranging his tie and who welcomed me, taking my boarding pass and scanning it. I soon realised the first person to greet me was a lounge attendant and was perhaps a little embarrassed that the reception chap was not ready. I enjoyed the breakfast and relaxed for a while until boarding was ready. I was welcomed and shown to my seat where the crew offered to put my bag in the overhead locker. I was then left for a few minutes to settle in before crew returned and offered a welcome drink. As it was a holiday, at 07.30 i went for Champagne! Menu was then Brought around before a short time later crew came and discussed when would like to eat. Qatar offer dine on demand so you eat when you want but they check with you your initial intentions which i think is great. Departure from LHR was delayed which meant an very quick connection in Doha where the flight was boarding when i arrived. DOH is smooth. On arrival there was a lady calling out for Bangkok who duly wrote the gate number on my boarding pass and advised to proceed to the gate. Doha to Bangkok was a late flight so i slept and arrived in to BKK fresh. My return to LHR was two weeks or so later. BKK was again a day flight. I would say they need more staff at check in at Suvarnabhumi. There were 2 counters business class side but that also included economy bag drop. There were 2 couples ahead of me and a queue for bag drop but business class trumped the bag drop people which was a respectable touch. It took about 15 minutes compared to LHR 5 mins. Again service on QSuite was great. Drink, menu, chocolates. Staff friendly and will chat. I often feel crew just go through then motions but actually on Qatar if you engage them they will happily chat. I spoke to some about where they were from, being based in Doha, stopover etc. It seems most only have about 24 hours once they arrive where they land - greulling. Flight from DOH to LHR was lacklustre. Boarding was chaotic. everyone moves forward, economy class not listening to their instructions to wait for their zone to be called. Initially only one staff scanning boarding passes who had to keep shouting Business class passengers only. Anyway once on board it started well. Drink brought, towel, menu. Order taken after take off which was fine, but they let themselves down by being the slowest service i have ever ever had. I had anticipated a quick bite to eat before getting a sleep in as i had to drive home on arrival -2 hours. We took off at 15.50 and i had'nt finished eating over halfway through the flight. Wine and nuts came - great i thought. It took 20 minutes for the amouse bouche to follow. Then when he came to clear I thought the soup would follow shortly. I was wrong.

This time I decided to take my family with a short stop over via Doha in order to save SGD3000 versus direct flight. We are a family of 4 travelling together on the way to Paris and returning on separate dates from London. I had to make three separate bookings as a consequence. I realised after making the booking it was not possible to fly together (as 3 bookings) and had to insist at the airport to be seated together. When checking online I was offered to pay 1200SGD extra for Business class upgrade which I did. I then realised the upgrade was only for one leg of the flight (Doha to Paris) and not for the entire journey. Then impossible to cancel online or by phone or to go back to the original booking and impossible to pay for the upgrade for the whole family - not available. Also cannot get a refund for the upgrade that is non refundable. The plane was slightly delayed with no explanation.  We arrived with 20 minutes delay in Doha with 55 minutes to catch the connection flight to Paris. The plane parked far away from the terminal and we endured a 10-15 minutes bus ride.

On board the 787 I was disappointed to find my foot space restricted by a big metal box under the seat, despite being a near-new aircraft. I got a vegetarian meal, but not the one I ordered - I think that went to my neighbour who didn't eat it. Qatar doesn't put names or seat numbers on special meals. We were a little late into Doha, but the delay was compounded when the aircraft parked a 20 minute bus ride away from the terminal. Security identified an issue with my hand luggage and made me unpack everything. Finally re-packed, I started the long walk to the new gate, only to have the security experience repeated - even though I quickly volunteered the small device which had caused issues at the previous check, they made me unpack everything, again. On board the A380 I have to say things took a big turn for the better, seats were comfortable, no metal boxes under the seats, I got the right meal and managed some sleep. Arrival in Perth was on time and luggage came quickly. I never did manage to get internet connectivity on the 787; I did on the A380, but be aware that the complimentary wifi they advertise is actually restricted to certain social media. So it was a mixed experience - I would fly Qatar again, but I think I would try to avoid the 787, transfer times under 2 hours, and Dublin.",Boeing 787 / A380,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Dublin to Perth via Doha ,2019-05-01,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,4,yes,Dublin,Perth ,qatar airways

Flight arrived in Doha almost 2 h late and most pax missed their connecting flight because the use of a remote position. It took 50 minutes from arrival till getting to the airport building. Very frustrating if there is a connecting flight. I made it as the last pax who arrived for the connecting flight to Stockholm, again, a remote position of the aircraft with a 25 min bus drive. Service on the both legs outstanding as always. Unfortunately, my baggage didn’t make it to Stockholm, and I was promised to have it delivered to my home within a day. That’s where the nightmare started. I had a connecting flight to Hamburg, and was informed a day later that they were not willing to deliver to my home. I have to collect the baggage from Hamburg airport. Since it’s a long way from my home to Hamburg, I have not been able to collect the bag yet and it’s day 5 after arrival. I think the airlines should take full responsibility if baggage is lost. No response to my emails....the same applies to phone calls...where I was told that reservation got nothing to do with it.

"""On board service was excellent""",9.0,C Down,2019-05-08,"✅ Trip Verified |  Bangkok to Gatwick via Doha. Ground service in Bangkok was mixed, check in and security were fine and very quick. Disappointed that the nice ticket wallets seem to no longer be issued (I wondered if it was a glitch on my outbound).. hardly necessary but was a nice touch. The lounge showers were not working. Thankfully I knew I could use the JAL lounge which was close by, but this was not offered by the staff when I made clear my disappointment at theirs not functioning. Other than that the lounge was excellent. Premium feeling but lovely food and drink options, very attentive professional staff and a nice mix of comfy and practical seating. Annoyingly the lounge was absolutely no where near the gate they were using tonight, approx 20 min walk. Whilst you expect this at the airlines hub airport, you do not expect it when at another world airport. With only a handful of flights a day and a dedicated lounge it should be possible to fly from gates at least on the same side of the airport. When eventually getting to the gate, having been prompted by lounge staff that the plane was boarding, all bus passenger had to stand for another 15 mins before they actually started boarding as the gate was so packed full there were no seats. Lounge in Doha is cavernous. Having visited a few times now I have decided that overall I don’t like it, and as Qatar airways expands and the lounge gets busier I like it less and less. Because it is just open space it always feels busy. The chairs are not particularly comfortable and there are coffee/soft drinks stands dotted about fairly sparsely, with main food and drink at either end. Obviously there are staff walking around who can provide you drinks, but I prefer more self service drinks to also be available. On board the service was excellent on both flights. Wonderful crew, and good quality food and drinks. Seats are very comfortable. On the 777 it was the old seat, although I actually really like this. It’s not quite fully flat but still very nice with excellent storage and I slept well. IFE is fine. Lots of choice and good resolution however the interface is clunky and unresponsive on both systems. The new one on Qsuite is much better. Landing in Gatwick reminds me that in spite of a lot of improvements Gatwick is still a horrible airport.. but it is convenient for me. Bags arrived quickly and immigration had a short queue.

"""the best we have ever had in economy class""",9.0,Alan Stone,2019-05-08,"✅ Trip Verified | Unbelievable level of personalised service even in the cheap seats. My wife and I have just completed 4 flights with Qatar Airways. Travelling to London from Melbourne via Doha and return. The first thing we noticed was the extended boarding time on the A380 which ensured orderly and relaxed boarding with no pushing and shoving and fighting for overhead bin space. The inflight service on 3 of the 4 flights was the best we have ever had in economy class. The service on the second flight while not in the same class as the other 3 flights was certainly as good as our regular carrier SQ so to complain would be pedantic. The choice of 3 options of meal (1 of which is vegetarian) at meal times was a pleasant addition and all meals I ate on all flights were full flavoured generous in size healthy and a step above the mush some airlines offer. Plenty of snacks and beverages offered throughout the flight. In short food and beverage is plentiful and with the extended choice of options should satisfy most passengers. Seat comfort (we had 3 A380 flights and 1 B787) was terrific enough legroom and width, the A380 was a little more generous and much quieter in the cabin than the B787. In fact the A380 certainly was the clear winner between both plane variants. The inflight entertainment system Oryx 1 was superb and offered a great selection of movies from new releases through to classics from the golden years of Hollywood, Music selection was the best I have encountered on an inflight entertainment system and I listened to a fair few full length albums to while away the time. Finally big shout out to the excellent Qatar flight crews who were professional, exuberant and hardworking with no crew vanishing acts here like most long hauls where you struggle to find crew after the first main meal service. In fact my wife mentioned as we were at the baggage carousel at Tullamarine, that it was the freshest she had ever felt after a long haul flight home, given we did London Doha (6.5 hours) 3 hours in the Oryx Lounge at Doha, then Doha To Melbourne (13.5 hours) .

On balance this was a good experience, not great. BCN-DOH on an A350 that apparently is owned by Latam and operated by Qatar. Branding was Qatar, but business class configuration was pure Latam - ie 2x2x2 - hence when they asked for in excess of 700 Euro to upgrade for a 6.5 hour flight I passed. Economy was pleasant as the flight wasn't crowded and I had three seats to myself. I did opt to upgrade on the DOH-BOM segment, as it was a Q-suite configured aircraft, and priced at just over 300 euro for a late night three hour flight arriving at 2:30am. India flights all running full post Jet Airways collapse so I thought it smart to upgrade. The Q-suite product is very good, although I found the suite a bit claustrophobic. Service was good.

I arrived 70 minutes before the flight, leaving 10 minutes to spare before the official cutoff time. There were three ticket agents and no one else in line. However, there apparently was some debate over who would have to serve me, as no one would check me in. Several times a clock behind the counter was pointed to, and the agents wandered off without acknowledging me. Finally a supervisor asked one of the agents to take care of me. The agent again pointed to the clock (which at this point was still about 7 minutes prior to the cutoff) but the supervisor pointed to the work station and finally I was attended to. On board, the flight crew seemed neglectful, we were pushing back during the safety presentation and there were passengers standing in the aisles.  The  inflight experience was fine. The seats were comfortable, legroom was adequate, and the cabin was clean, and even economy class gets an amenity kit. The meals were the highlight, with multiple cuisines on offer. An hour of free wifi is included for anyone who pays enough attention to read these things, and the connection speed was truly exceptional. The only complaint about the inflight experience was the headphone jack. If you want to use your own headset, bring a two pronged adapter, or you'll suffer through the adequate but not much-more-than-that headset provided. My second flight was 10 hours after my first, and the Doha Airport is a tragic experience unless you have, or pay for lounge access. or you have a desire to shop for high end luxury brands of clothing and luggage.  The connecting flight was just like the first, but with no seat charging options.  A bit surprising to not have that option, but the entertainment system was good enough to keep me amused.

The Airbus A350-1000 is the latest addition to Qatar Airways' fleet, with its Q Suites that have been raved as the best business class product in the world. In my opinion, it is indeed the best business class product I experienced to date. First and Business Class passengers had their own vast premium check-in area and, not a separate line but a separate security screening facility, which made the whole process peaceful and seamless. The lounge at Doha airport was huge and beautiful. It was quite crowded when I came as it took me a while to find a dining table. However, it did not seem like a chronic issue as it was cleared shortly after. Food offerings were OK, not inspiring providing this was their home base. The gate area, though, was tight and crowded, but I think that was more about the airport. However, as QR is the main operator of the airport, I am surprised why they do not exercise their influence on the design of the gate, which has just been recently completed, to match their excellent service. My Q Suite, in my opinion, was the most intelligently designed business class seat I have seen (those included AA, DL, UA, CX, CI, JL, RJ, BR, TK, BA, OZ, VN, KE, GA and more). The suite may have appeared a bit claustrophobic with the door closed, but it felt totally different with generous shoulder room and hip room, which made sleeping so easy and comfortable.

As for the seat - my seat was very uncomfortable. It was behind an exit row.

Physically it is an impressive space. However, during the morning peak hour it transforms into a bus station with all the unpleasantness that goes with it.

Both flights full, the first leg being a real flight from hell because of screaming children who wouldn't stop during the 4 hr flight. QR has added an extra seat on their B777-200LR's as well as B777-300ER's during their latest refurbishment (3-4-3 in Economy), which makes the seating extremely cramped and the aisles too narrow. I'm 6""1' and due to the too narrow seat, it was very hard to find a comfortable position to eat or rest, the seat is simply not suitable for me. The cabin crew are all very good and hard-working, meals OK for Economy and the Oryx entertainment system way above many competitors, but I found it hard to enjoy all this due to the problems mentioned.  We had 55 min connection at CPH (QR to SAS) but since QR was delayed due to an extremely long taxiing at DOH, we managed to catch SAS thanks to the security check and passport control at CPH, however, our bags didn't make it and came 24 hrs later due to the fact that QR has one ground handling agent at CPH and SAS another. All in all, QR is a good airline to fly with and DOH is a great airport as suggested by fellow travellers as well but, in my opinion, the cramped cabins in Economy don't reflect a five-star experience and the cabin crew struggle on the narrow aisles to provide five-star service they have been so well trained for.

The outbound was great, as I have come to expect with QR (who I have been flying with long haul premium for about 4 years). Nothing to be faulted. The 787 was a great business class, enhanced by the quality of the product and service. On the other hand, the 777 from Doha to JFK took the business class experience to a totally new level. The QSuites product, in my mind, is the best business class offering around, which compares favourably with the FC offering of some major airlines. Not to mention the numerous onboard staff and their fantastic service - in particular a young gent who led the onboard team from Doha to Jakarta on the return leg was outstanding! This is not to ignore the contributions of the other young gents and ladies who made both my trips a totally memorable experience. To summarise, QR business class was an outstanding product, mainly thanks to the commitment of their people. QR QSuites takes this to a totally new level! To get the perfect product, QR should either provide free internet for their premium customers (and reduce the pricepoint for the economy) or be more generous with the allowances, and reduce internet access prices.

"""changed business class experience""",8.0,R Sanyal,2018-10-28,"✅ Trip Verified |  Doha to New York JFK. Excellent flight on a refurbished aircraft that has completely changed the business class travel experience on this route by creating a sense of big space while providing much needed privacy. On previous travel on this morning flight from Doha to JFK, the plane had a 2-2-2 open layout -- affording no privacy at all while being crowded, having to jump over a passenger if you were not on the aisle seat. Now, the new Q-Suite layout has changed all that. The configuration is 1-2-1, some seats face the back of the plane. There is a ""door"" that seals off your little cubicle equipped with all you need - plug and charge points, large pull out desk table to eat and work on, counters to keep your possessions, a hook to hang your coat, a cupboard for your footwear, reading lights, duvets, pillows, a large TV screen with numerous entertainment choices, and a seat that adjusts in many ways including lie flat. I was able to sleep several hours in absolute privacy in a window seat, 3A. The flight attendants are drawn from many countries of the world and they speak English well. There was a very large menu of food and drinks - cards listing them provided. Qatar provides meals and drinks on request throughout the flight. I am not partial to this form of service. One has to either call the flight attendant or go to the alley to place one's order -- they are delivered to your seat. Overall, the quality of the food is so-so but you are bound to find something that you fancy. Too much effort goes into laying the table cloth and the folded napkin across the waist and setting the place and cleaning it, time and again. Qatar is having an outsize impact on the environment by being so extravagant with their on-demand food and drink service. The flight was smooth and arrived on time. Choice of hot and cold towels were offered at take off and landing. Amenities kit was a hard shell bag, pink in color.

"""onboard service inconsistent""",7.0,G Jones,2018-10-09,"✅ Trip Verified | London to Colombo via Doha. Qatar Airways flies from London Heathrow Terminal 4. Check in was fast and efficient, we were offered last minute upgrades to business class for £590.00 for both of us on the DOH-CMB leg- we would have been happy to pay for it if it meant we get the extra tier points and miles (Me and my partner are both OW Sapphires but the check in agent said we won't get any of the extra benefits except for the flat beds). We politely asked for our bags to be tagged as fragile and she happily obliged and added a 'First Class' tag instead of 'Business' due to us being OW Sapphires. Requested for front row bulkhead seats and this was done with no hesitation. Overall, check in experience with Qatar Airways at LHR T4 was swift and efficient. As oneworld Sapphires, we get business class lounge and we were able to use the Skyteam Lounge which in all honesty is nothing to write about so we hang in there for an extra hour before the Malaysia Airlines Golden Lounge opened. We weren't allowed to use the Qatar Airways Premium Lounge as we were non business class revenue passengers. Boarding, again very timely and efficient. After boarding, we noticed that the carpet on our seats were very wet- we weren't sure if it was vomit, juice or whatever. We spoke to the Inflight Service Manager explaining we weren't happy with the situation and she did her best to find us alternative seats and went the extra mile by finding us exit rows. My partner was not happy sitting in the middle and preferred a window seat and asked if we could go back to our original seats or get upgraded to business class which to our surpise, there was one and was happy to give it to one of us but we both decided we wanted to sit together. After take off, the Inflight Services Manager came to our row with 6 blankets to put on the wet carpet and sprayed it with a fabric freshener and gave us 2 glasses of champagne each for the inconvenience! The flight leaving late in the evening, the cabin crew swung into action to serve dinner and drinks to maximise passenger rest times. Despite what others have said on here regarding QR's inflight meal, they are honestly nothing to write about but disappointing. Small portion, dry and bland. But having eaten in the lounges, it didn't matter to us. Cabin crew were fairly stingy with drinks as well, only giving one 150 ml can unless you ask for two. Unlike other airlines such as Qantas, Cathay Pacific and American Airlines, you get a 200 mls or 330 mls sized can opended for you and get given another can! The second meal service before landing in Doha was slightly better. The pancake was delicious. Qatar Airways' IFE selection was great, I watched one movie and the rest trying to get some rest and listening to the massive selection of music albums. IFE screen was responsive though showing its age. With the overall onboard service of Qatar Airways, I find that the onboard service to be inconsistent. Whilst the Inflight Services Manager went the extra mile to make sure our flight was a comfortable one and repeatedly apologised for the inconvenience due to the wet carpet, the younger and more juinor flight attendants were dismissive and inconsistent and the onboard meals and drink service is a bit of a hit and miss.

Lounge access smoothly provided in KGL and DOH and they were both excellent. All Boarding Passes issued at Check-In in Kigali. Online check in possible but constitute a nuisance as the BP issued are not respected/valid in KGL. Flights from Central Africa are derouted from KGL to DOH which cost some 2-3 hours additional flight time due to flight ban over UAE. Pre-departure drinks offered on both flights. Inflight entertainment was not working properly so had to change seat (1st flight). FA and service onboard good, but food is poorer than before. E.g. no beef or fish are available. Lamb chops appeared to be some tough meat. Drinks are fine but sparsely loaded (they ran out of 2 beer brands and remained with Heineken only). No ice-cream. Doha-Saigon leg was a perfect flight, the FAs were fantastic, very proactive and truly caring. Food was much better on this leg as compared to the previous. Got a delicate cod as main dish.

"""ambience and comfort is unmatched""",9.0,John Moore,2018-09-17,"✅ Trip Verified |  Canberra to London via Sydney / Doha. This was the first time my wife and I had flown with Qatar Airways and my first international flight from Canberra. The B777 from Canberra are now the “Suites” version - as impressive as many reviewers have already reported and the onboard service - personal attention, food, beverage (see further comment below), in flight entertainment, ambience and comfort - as many have already stated is unmatched. My main purpose with this review is to provide guidance to passengers from CBR with the procedures unique to Canberra airport. Check-in opens three hours prior to departure and guidance indicates it closes one hour prior to departure, this is conducted by QANTAS staff at the far left QF check-in desks with the usual friendly, helpful assistance. The first of two security checks is conducted as if you were a regular domestic passenger. Qatar uses the QANTAS Business Class lounge for BC passengers, QANTAS Club members travelling in economy will not get access as they do not have a QF flight number. Approximately one hour prior to departure BC passengers are invited to access the international area of the airport - the length of the terminal and in Virgin territory. Having gone up another level there is the Border Force passport check (electronic for those with suitable passports) followed by the second full regime security check. The international departure gate now has limited duty free sales and coffee shop, snacks, bar facilities. In our case boarding was delayed by about 25 minutes meaning a longer than expected wait. Boarding was by class through separate desks. Onboard an allocated flight attendant explained the features of the Suite for first timers and offered a pre departure drink (only water and juices were mentioned but champagne is available if requested). After the short 30 minute hop to Sydney all passengers are required to disembark with all their carry-on. There are no further formalities at SYD, disembarkation being directly into the departures concourse; there is ample time to get to the QANTAS BC lounge ard have lunch if so desired. The 15 hour flight post SYD had only one low point from Qatar’s otherwise outstanding point of view, despite the glossy wine and beverage menu (two champagnes, three whites, three reds with a “stickey” and a port plus beers, spirits and soft drinks) within four hours, and still over Australia, the whites had been exhausted.

At around 2030 pm, I went to the Main office in the terminal if our flight was canceled or not, and it was. I asked for priority accommodation because I was traveling with my immobile mother who needs rest and my son. They did not refuse as my mother is a priority passenger, and they said that they will give us accommodation also because we checked out of our condominium in Quezon City, and we had no where else to stay. The polite and very nice staff at Qatar Airways is to give us contact numbers for the new flight the next day when the runway will open, then we got on a bus to a five-star hotel that we were amazed by, which the airline paid for, not us! The next day, we get a text from the coordinator that there will be a flight at 1730 pm QR2929, we quickly packed our things and checked out. We finally got to the airport (Terminal 1) and it was shambolic, stranded passengers, crowded, with no coordination, but it was not Qatar Airways' fault, it was the airports' disappointment of not organizing this problem fluently.

It was my first time on Qatar's A359 and I can't help but notice the improvements in its new economy class product. Seat pitch was superb, and much more spacious than its Dreamliner counterpart. The new Thales entertainment system was intuitive, but the selection pales in comparison with Emirates. The gray seats provided a contrast with the maroon seat covers. While the Dreamliner economy was OK, it pales in comparison with the A359's. My only gripe with this particular A359 was that the WCs seem clunky, especially for a new aircraft. One was out of order, while the order had a broken toilet seat. As usual, Qatar's inflight service is commendable. Attendants were very responsive, courteous, and pleasant. Drinks were frequently offered, which is a practice that I would like to see in other airlines. On the DOH-CRK leg, a flight attendant was concerned that my preferred dinner from the menu was unavailable (I was on one of the last rows served), and so she made sure that I get the first pick for breakfast. These little things leave a lasting impression. I've been on a lot of trips, including many with QR, and I can't remember a time where the FAs go this extra. And of course, flying with QR will likely take you on a layover at DOH - the best airport in the Middle East. Good things aside, the flight out of ZRH was delayed for more than half an hour, which means that my almost two-hour transit time at DOH would be cut short. It wasn't the airline's fault, but it was a good call on their part to dock at a remote gate at DOH and ferry the passengers via bus directly to the transit security check.

Check-in was quick and efficient in both airports. Seat 3K (right window) on B777 was comfortable and spacious. Flight attendants were friendly, and addressed me by name. Qatar offer dining on demand, and my excellent dinner arrived when requested. From the menu, lobster stood out, but it was not available. The FA saw my disappointment, and twice during the flight the purser came to apologise. The beef replacement was excellent. Food overall was probably the best I have had on an airplane. Wine was also really good. Couldn't fault the service, with a nice amenity kit, including Georgio Armani after shave balm, after shave, and lots of moisturisers, lip balm etc. Pyjamas are also supplied and it was easy to get 6 hours good sleep. IFE was good, with a reasonable selection, and an excellent moving map display, including simulated head-up display and instrument panel. First leg arrived on time, and then all change to the Boeing 787. Service on to Dublin was of a similar standard, and the breakfast omelette, which came after a nice fruit selection and cereal, was very tasty. The interesting thing here is the comparison between the B777 and 787. The 787's seat (2K window seat), is angled so you have no-one beside you. The Boeing 787 windows are just huge, and are electronically dimmed. Cabin lighting is very sophisticated, but I have to say that overall I was a little disappointed with the Boeing 787. The seat is not as spacious or comfortable as the older 777, and the IFE is decidedly fiddly and unfriendly to use. I could see several passengers needing assistance with it, and the FA's couldn't figure it out either. The moving map display was different also, and strangely for a newer airplane, it was much more basic, and missed most of the nice features available on the 777.

Food and drinks including presentation was more akin to a first class product really. The seat in the 787 is the excellent herringbone config and was very comfortable and with a lot of storage and table space. At Doha I did not have long to change planes so did not have time to enjoy the lounge. On the 777 the service was just as excellent, I didn’t sample the dinner as I went straight to sleep but the breakfast was excellent and the dine in demand meant that it could fit around when I woke up and I wanted to eat, an amazing plus! The 777 was an older one with the old 2-2-2 config which actually isn’t too bad, the seat and bed are both comfortable although as I am quite tall I much prefer a seat with a separate food stool.

The seats were too narrow in my opinion and leg room was not too generous. Service by the cabin staff was good. The in flight entertainment was okay. Some recent new movies were the highlight. The screen is not very high quality and headphones supplied had to have its connection moved around to work properly, which was not a good experience at all and this happened on my recent flights with them. I was disappointed with the food quantities and frequency. The main meals for breakfast and supper (somehow never got lunch) are very small, notwithstanding that there are some other small accompaniments. The choices of were only basically chicken or vegetarian. The problem that I had with how often meals were served was particularly on one of my connecting flights to Doha, which started boarding at 12:45. They did not serve lunch and instead served supper at 16:00 and in the evening, they only served their tiny hot sandwich, which is a small rectangular pie and a tiny cupcake. As a result, I was very hungry throughout the flight. On arrival to my final destination, my suitcase was also damaged, with two sharp metal parts sticking out from the bottom and when I inquired about it at the baggage desk, they refused to even acknowledge that there was any damage and were quite frankly rude. This was ridiculous. ",Boeing 787,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Johannesburg to Edinburgh via Doha,2018-04-01,1.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2,no,Johannesburg,Edinburgh ,qatar airways
"""flight attendant was excellent""",8.0,Peter Kubler,2018-04-14,"✅ Trip Verified |  My wife and I had booked a return trip Adelaide to Frankfurt via Doha over Easter. A few days before departure Qatar offered an upgrade to Business Class for the 2 legs and we decided to upgrade for about $2500 for Adelaide Doha. This was well worth it, we ate well, our Romanian our flight attendant was excellent and attended to our every need and I managed to sleep about 9 hours. The next leg, Doha to Frankfurt was only 6 hours and it passed uneventfully but in Economy Class. Our return flight, about 12 days later from Frankfurt to Doha passed quickly as well. On the nearly 14 hour flight from Doha to Adelaide we each had a row of seats. The A350 which Qatar uses for the 14 hours long haul, has a 3x3x3 configuration which made sleeping possible. But economy class food left a lot to be desired. I was served lamb in apricot sauce which was so dry that I think they forgot about the sauce. For the brunch I opted for the Cheddar Cheese scrambled egg and this was also very dry . However, the desserts served were of a good enough standard.

The IFE on the A350 is great and easy to use. The B777 less so. At JFK, we were delayed leaving. The ground staff made no announcements about the delay for over two hours. They only made one when I finally trudged up to the small, packed, outdated gate area and told them they needed to. Then, a chaotic boarding commenced that was a free-for-all. In DOH, I missed my connection by a half hour or so. There was no ground staff there with information on my flight to Kigali, I had to go to their transfer desk to get vouchers for the stay in Doha. Next morning the immigration was woefully understaffed. It took 1 hour to clear immigration because there were a couple of disinterested workers and hundreds of passengers needing to get through.

I would give this airline 10 out of 10, but only going got give it 8 out of 10 due to not having my choice of food.

"""atmosphere is much warmer""",9.0,Attila Toth,2018-03-26,"✅ Trip Verified | Flew Qatar Airways from Oslo to Doha. The business cabin on the B787 planes is at the front of the plane, since there is no first class. At the second door a small onboard self-service bar is in place where champagne, wine and snacks are provided during the flight. Two additional seats can be found behind the bar and between the toilets, these are not recommended. Due to the small cabin (compared to the A380 cabins) the atmosphere is much warmer and the staff can pay more attention to passengers. The overhead compartments are missing above the middle seats that makes the cabin more spacious, but middle seat passengers must use the storage above the window seats. Usually it is not a problem, the space is still enough, but I felt uncomfortable in disturbing others by opening the storage above them. The 1-2-1 herringbone configuration seats provide great comfort and space, they are like first class seats at some other airlines. They can be converted to a full-flat bed, however some may find the leg space limited. The screen is large enough and the noise cancellation headsets close out every disturbance. Since it was a day flight, pajamas were only available upon request. The service was excellent and Qatar Airways' on-demand a'la carte menu allows passengers to meal whenever and whatever they wish. Before take-off the flight attendants book the meal requests and the preferred time of the serving, then they return when time comes. Of course passengers can change their mind anytime but it is worth booking the meals in advance to ensure they do not run out. In my case they ran out of Hungarian desert wine Tokaji but substituted with an Australian one. The meals were delicious, but not show-stopping.

Qatar Airways customer review,3.0,Hugh Colton,2018-03-20,"✅ Trip Verified |  Doha to Atlanta. When checking in in Atlanta despite telling the agent we were going to stop in Doha she checked our bags to Kathmandu. The agent had to have her supervisor correct the error. The same happened in Kathmandu despite my very clear instructions that we were going to Doha. When I saw that incorrect bag tags had been printed she was quite rude telling me that I should have told her that we were only going to Doha.  Doha airport has been built to a very high standard, there is a train to take passengers to the gates, however arriving passengers must walk to the terminal. Admittedly almost everyone on both flights into Doha were in transit. We were not. The passport process was very poor. At least an hour wait on both occasions. There are 36 immigration gates, of which no more than five were manned. After the first stay in Doha we found the check-in process for our flight to Kathmandu relatively simple. I'm OneWorld sapphire member, and the process worked OK. Qatar Airways has a lounge that permits entry to OneWorld  members and we were able to enjoy a breakfast before joining the flight to Kathmandu. After the second stay in Doha we had to checkin at a special area for passengers travelling to the USA. We later learnt on return to the US that our miles from Doha to Atlanta did not appear in our AA accounts. Of the 45 minutes we expected to have in the Qatar Airways lounge to have breakfast we had just 20 minutes before we were called to the gate. Passengers with computers or iPads were sent to a special security area and devices checked and placed in sealed plastic bags which could not be opened until on board the aircraft.  My wife's iPad is in a very tightly fitting leather protective case. The security people insisted that this had to be removed which proved very difficult. The leather case was never examined and just returned to her, so what that proved I have no idea. All this additional security meant that the flight departed Doha late and in turn arrived late in Atlanta. The food on Qatar Airways is very basic.

"""found the crew to be pleasant""",6.0,Nathan Jones,2018-03-13,"✅ Trip Verified | This was my first long haul economy flight in a decade. After been fortunate enough to fly in the front quite often I was on a money saving effort and so did London Heathrow to Sydney return via Doha in economy. I scored a great fare in their annual January sale. I found the service was very good on all flights. I was in the upper deck economy cabin at the back and found the crew to be pleasant and also very responsive whenever I asked for another drink. The legroom was about as good as it will get in economy, which is to say it wasn’t complete torture. It’s up there with the best. The inflight entertainment was sufficiently diverse to occupy me for four long flights, with a mix of older and very new releases. I’d say one of the better systems. Oneworld sapphire and emerald members are treated as second class citizens. Staff were falling over themselves for a QR silver member (OW Ruby) on one leg of my journey which I found odd. This was until I realised that in Doha if you fly economy you don’t have access to the regular business class lounge but  a second tier lounge. Having experienced the Al Mourjan lounge previously I can say the Qatar business class lounge is less superior (think run of the mill AA lounge in the US). Overall the experience as a Sapphire or Emerald member doesn’t matter to Qatar. I had heard that upper deck economy is reserved for premium fliers - this is incorrect. You will get first dibs on the seats, but then it’s open season once online check-in opens. On my DOH-LON flight the lower deck was a third full whilst the upper deck was 3/4 full. I found the food revolting, particularly noteworthy was a chicken biryani from DOH to SYD. But it’s economy so you get what you pay for I guess. Overall I would definitely pay for Qatar in business class, but an indirect route in economy is not something I’ll be seeking out again.

Punctual flights, uneventful. 3 hours scheduled additional time delay avoiding overflying Saudia Arabia. FAs are excellent – world-class. Annoying announcements – many of them superfluous. They continue their charity propaganda for Educate a Child – that really puzzles me. How naïve are we passengers to blindly support financially some glossy outlayed institution without providing neutral facts? The 2nd flight left 02 a.m. and did hardly have any food for business class. No real hot dishes – no fish, no meat, only cold piece salmon was offered. They offered a beef filet which was only a spoon of rice with some shredded meat in a heavy brown sauce. No chilli, no fishsauce, no ginger, no icecream, no nothing. I was only saved by an alert FA who managed to secure me a reasonable meal of fish from economy class. Never experienced this before when travelling in business class.

My flight from London was delayed by nearly 2 hours, however when I checked in I was offered to be moved to the earlier flight (which was about to board). I accepted and for my troubles I was given an exit row on my first flight and an entire row to myself on the second. Qatar economy has nearly 2 extra inches on most other airlines and you can tell. As someone who is only 5ft 10 I had more than enough room on the second leg. Service is generally very good, however the food and drink selections are a little basic compared to Emirates, offering only Red label scotch, Smirnoff vodka and Beefeater gin. Food was just okay. The IFE was good, without being great, offering largely B-list films with 2 or 3 blockbusters. Qatar offers 10 minutes/10mb of free WiFi which is basically enough to check your Twitter, then 30 minutes for $6USD. It's a nice touch, but very steep compared to Emirates flight long Wi-Fi for $1USD. Overall, if bad scotch and average movies don't bother you, Qatar is for you.

I saw the ticket agent physically deflate when my large piece of luggage came in under the weight requirements. Their luggage handling is infuriating. The 10 across seating in the 777 economy is offering narrow 17"" wide seats. Seat recline is better than most, which can cut both ways - comfortable for sleeping, but if the person in front of you reclines the entire flight, you won't have room to work on your laptop. That doesn't matter much as the 777s don't have wifi. The entertainment choices are excellent, but the screens are old, tired, unintuitive, and not particularly responsive. The flight tracking maps are useless, flashing from a screen showing an ad to a screen showing the pitch of the aircraft, to a sparse map written in only Arabic. To give credit where it's due, they mostly nail the food. Three entree choices, and enough on your tray to constitute a meal. If you're used to US airlines, you'll be pleasantly surprised at the amount and quality of food provided. Finally, the connections at the Doha airport are a special kind of punishment, it's a massive facility filled with every high end retailer in the world.

Luggage transferred with high precision. Terrible bus-gating in Doha: have to walk inside the airport for almost 2 km, for them just to board by taking a bus drive for another 3 km: why don’t they then bus people from the central area and drive all 5 km instead of letting everybody walk 2 km first? Elite status respected: staff were very respectful and advising. Very expensive ticket, double price as compared to competing carriers on this route (like ET and KQ). Due to the Arab ban on Qatar, a huge deroute from DOH to East Africa was undertaken to avoid flying over Saudi-Arabia. It consumes 2 hours extra travel. Another 2 hours was added for an un-announced stop in Entebbe. Altogether the flight became a full day flight while it should have been ½ day flight.

"""become my airline of choice""",10.0,J Gallian,2017-12-18,"✅ Trip Verified |  Doha to Philadelphia. After a 10 hour flight on the Boeing 777-300 I was looking forward to comparing both cabins. I have to say that even tho the A350 is one of my favorite aircrafts because of how much quieter it is and the external camera views that give you a sense of extra safety and peace of mind, I wish the seats were like the ones on the triple seven. The capsule made me feel a bit claustrophobic not to mention that you completely feel far apart from your traveling companion. On the Boeing 777 we were side by side, talking, eating and just loving the flight, on the A350 we felt apart so much so that because the cabin was not full we chose an isle and a window seat (the hallway was between us) but we felt closer. I think Qatar is aware of this and the new Q-Suites will fix this for couples or families that travel together. The tray table is located in a place that during the sleep portion of my 14 hour flight I found myself hitting my knees often. I felt shelled in and at times it was not comfortable. The A350 also has a mini stand in lounge that none used during the flight except for me to actually stretch during portions of the flight. The crew also looked as if they were working with less space than in the triple seven. Qatar’s service is the best in the industry so these things I point out just in comparison with the previous equipment flown. I also have to mention that because the same crew had double the passengers to serve they did not spend as much time with you as they did on my previous flight. One thing that is unique to Qatar is their business class affordability if they have the seats to sell the upgrade. On other airlines even if they have the seats they don’t give you the opportunity to pay for an upgrade. I booked this 14 hour flight coach and upgraded for $850.00 and trust me the superior service is worth it alone.

The check in at the Manila airport was not done by Qatar staff and it was mediocre at best. It felt like I was checked in by robots. This is something that needs to improve.

"""the service is outstanding""",10.0,M Gallian,2017-12-12,"✅ Trip Verified | I would like to begin this review by agreeing that Qatar by far is the best airline I have ever flown. The experience on board in economy was the best I have ever had. In this review I have also attached some photos because there is not too much information about economy and you need to know that if you’re considering flying this airline please do so because you will not regret it. The seats are comfortable, the food is very good, the entertainment is also very good but the service is outstanding. The seats in coach have plenty of legroom and this aircraft with the interior LED lighting system, the larger than standard windows, and the quiet engines made this 10 hour flight from Philadelphia to Doha very comfortable. The only thing I must point out is that unfortunately the check in at the Philadelphia airport is not done by Qatar personnel instead by a company that does check in for multiple airlines therefore the experience is not so pleasant, in my opinion this is not fair for the airline because it makes the job of the crew on board more difficult. I will do a separate review about the airport in Doha with detailed information. I have to say that the A350 is probably the best aircraft in the market and Qatar by far the best airline in service, comfort, safety, and value for the money paid. My favorite feature of the A350 has to be the external camera views. Qatar is simply changing the way we fly and I’ll fly with them as often as I can and you should to.",A350,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Philadelphia to Doha,2017-12-01,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5,yes,Philadelphia,Doha,qatar airways

"""very mixed experience""",5.0,Simon Smith,2017-12-06,"✅ Trip Verified |  Paris to Perth via Doha. We had a very mixed experience with Qatar Airways. The outward journey to Perth was excellent - the seating is very comfortable (better on the A380 than the 777), food was great, and there's a good range of entertainment. Changing planes in Doha was easy although a small issue was that the business class lounge doesn't have enough showers to meet the demand, and we had to wait quite a long time. However, our return journey from Sydney on 19 November was a disaster. We were on the cancelled flight that another passenger has posted about, and I can confirm that Qatar's handling of the situation was chaotic. Once finally off the plane, despite being almost at the front of the queue, we had to wait two hours before we got sent to a hotel. We were told we would be called or emailed with details of a new flight, but we weren't, and all through the next morning it was impossible to get through to their call centre in Australia, and all of the others seemed to be closed. Around lunchtime, another passenger I spoke to advised me to check under manage booking on the website; when I did, to my surprise I found I had been booked on a flight via Beijing in less than an hour, and never told. By the time we got to check in, we'd missed that. There were no Qatar staff at the airport, but eventually we did get through to a call centre, and finally got rerouted on Qantas to London. Qatar has made no effort to contact us since - I'd hope they'd at least refund what we spent on phone calls. I understand technical problems can happen, but an airline needs some sort of contingency plan, and a global 24/7 airline really needs a 24/7 call centre.",A380 and 777,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Paris to Perth via Doha,2017-11-01,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,5,yes,Paris,Perth ,qatar airways

"""no communication from Qatar Airways""",5.0,Judith Stevens,2017-12-01,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Sydney via Doha went without hitch and I was happy with the seat, service, lounge etc and would happily have given a 9/10 rating for this airline. However, on the return from SYD to LHR there was a technical problem with the aircraft and after sitting in our seats for two hours the flight was cancelled due to the 11pm curfew at Sydney airport. Total chaos as we had to re-enter immigration, reclaim baggage and pass through customs eventually ending up in the check in area with only four staff members attempting to deal with all 450+ passengers and no separate queue for business and first class passengers. After waiting in line for two hours I was allocated a hotel room and told that Qatar Airways would contact me by telephone with details of onward journey. Finally arrived at hotel at 2.15am. By 10am the following morning I had heard nothing and was due to check out of hotel by 11, together with other passengers who had heard nothing. Numerous calls to the number given for the airline were unanswered and I eventually decided to check my booking online and found that I had been re-booked on a Qantas flight leaving that afternoon. I made my own way to the airport and checked in with no problem but to date, now ten days later, I have had no communication from Qatar Airways. I appreciate that there can be technical difficulties but the total lack of customer service is not what one expects from an airline.",A380,Solo Leisure,Business Class,London to Sydney via Doha,2017-11-01,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,4,no,London,Sydney ,qatar airways

Yes they offer a pre flight booking service, but this is not the book to cook service. Only selection is from the menu of the given flight. On my case, there was not any dinner served, only a sandwich selection, so I had sandwich on the lounge and then sandwich on the plane. Last time I flew a year ago, with the same flight, there was full dinner service. There were not pyjamas on my size and they gave me the biggest they had, a medium/large which I did not use.

"""such a comfortable flight""",10.0,Craig Gardiner,2017-11-28,"✅ Trip Verified |  Melbourne to Oslo via Doha, returning from London. I flew on 3 different aircraft with Qatar's business class product and all were consistently amazing. My wife and I flew on the A380 from Melbourne to Doha, the Boeing 787 onto Oslo and A350 out of London before connecting on the A380 back into Melbourne. The 787 was the smallest of Business class but this did not impact the standard or level of service and the seat layout of 1x2x11 is almost identical to the other aircraft. The A350 is about double the size and the A380 would be double that again. 3 out of our 4 flights were overnight and therefor we were able to utilise the lay flat beds, pajamas and noise cancelling headphones to their full advantage. The cabin crew are happy to convert your seat into a bed whilst you get changed in the bathroom. Branded amenity kits are provided. The a la carte menu on all flights was different and you have a wide range of beers and spirits along with a comprehensive international wine and champagne list. First and Business class passengers have the option of boarding first and can enjoy a glass of bubbles .. or two before take off whilst the rest of the plane boards. The A380 also offers the inflight lounge or bar that is for use of First and Business passengers -  it allows you a separate space to socialise. There is an impressive cocktail list and a variety of canapes and snacks available too. I can honestly say that I have never experienced such a comfortable flight and the 14 hours to Doha and further 6 hours to Europe went far too quickly. I didn't want to get off the plane.

"""still refusing me any refund""",1.0,P Haime,2017-11-24,"✅ Trip Verified |  Barcelona to Hong Kong return via Doha in business class, and I decided to add my children to the trip (to travel in economy class) about two weeks before the departure. Qatar Airways website would not sell me a ticket for them, so I called their call centre and they were happy to sell me two return economy tickets for my 4 and 7 year old. On arrival at check in at Barcelona the staff realised that the tickets I had been sold for the children were illegal because the younger of the two children was under 5, which they told me is the minimum age on that airline for travel in a cabin separate from the parents. As the flight was leaving in two hours I was offered two alternatives: to downgrade myself to economy with the children with no compensation, or pay the airport upgrade price for them to travel with me in business, which I did because the staff at BCN believed Qatar would refund me as the mistake was theirs. On the return trip from HKG the check in staff had no problem with the children travelling in economy and me in business and the return trip was far easier. I was astounded by the mistakes and three months later, Qatar is still refusing me any refund or any form of compensation for the money I was forced, apparently needlessly, to spend on the outward journey so that the children could travel with me in business class.

Entertainment options were good and current.  Online check-in wasn't easy; towards the end of the process, there is an option to email the boarding pass but this never worked for me.  It would have been good, as part of the online check-in, if the users reminded to specify the meal preferences, etc. I forgot to specify the meal preferences but thankfully the crew had enough of what I wanted. Seats were the worst part - poor legroom.  ATL to DOH leg was the worst (and the longest leg of the trip), comfort wise, I would rate as the worst. Luckily on the return leg (DOH-ATL) next two seats to mine was empty, so was able to stretch and sleep well.

We were receiving a refreshment drink to our choice before take off. After take-off you can close the doors on your suite and then it really feels like you are in a private room on an airplane.

The cabin crew was so nice to us, they really made this trip even more special by the way they treated us. I had pre-ordered an asian vegetarian meal but the flight attendant looked through the menu with me to see if i changed my menu to what i preferred most.

On this trip I enjoyed the older 777 layout and entertainment system over the so called state of the art 787-8 which had hard seats that hurt my shoulder with very little privacy. The entertainment system on the outbound flight was ok but on the 787 was very difficult to operate. Food on both flights was less than average, the encrusted chicken tasted awful and even worse was my choice of appetizer on the return flight, the Arabic Mezze which I missed was dropped by the cabin attendant and it was the last one.

My biggest disappointment was they overbooked the flight from Doha to Chennai and upgraded several Economy passengers to Business. I have no worries with that and have been lucky myself several times.

On my return overnight flight back from JoBurg, I accidentally left a package in the overhead bin. The manager at the transfer desk personally arranged for that package to be brought immediately from the plane, which was parked far away from the actual terminal building, to me so I could take it on my connecting flight to Chicago.

"""my itinerary had been changed""",3.0,B Carsen,2017-10-25,"✅ Verified Review |  Denpasar to London via Doha. I booked two round trips with Qatar Airways, one for Sept 25 to October 23rd and one for November 5th to Dec 17th. We are Gold Privilege members (only relevant for the lack of care shown for a frequent business class traveller). On October 22nd, the day before my flight, I went online to on Qatar's website to check my seat selection was still valid. I hadn't received any notifications by text, email or via the Qatar app on my phone, yet online, there was a warning box showing that my itinerary had been changed. I had been bumped from the quick connection (1 hour 10m) in Doha onto a flight which left an hour and a half later. My arrival time at LHR would now be 10pm instead of 8.25pm; a real inconvenience for me. As it was Sunday afternoon in Bali, there was no office open to call and ask why the change. I tried the London and Doha offices; both were closed. The flight I had been bumped off was still being advertised online as being available to book, but I could do nothing, so I spent an hour making arrangements involving costly calls to the UK from Bali. I checked in early the next day and asked at the desk to put me back on the original flight. At first, the desk staff said they could not help me and I'd have to speak to the transfer desk in Doha, but once the question of which flight my bag would be checked to, came up (with me refusing to allow it to be on the later flight),  they were able to check me on to the earlier flight. I lost all my seat selections with a change of aircraft, and ended up on the undesirable window seats on both legs of the 777-300. The stewardess told me that the aircraft was changed 3 weeks before the flight; again, there was no notification about the change and that my allocated seats were no longer available. Neither of my two legs had internet on board. My arrival in Doha was delayed by half an hour so I had 40 minutes, along with 21 other passengers, to get to the next flight. We made it easily; however, I deeply regret getting onboard for the following: The mystery of being bumped was solved; much of the aircraft's business class section was occupied by a local family along with their appallingly behaved children of various ages. For 7 hours, non-stop, we were bombarded by toddlers running around or screaming to each other across rows of seats, by their staff running in and out of economy trying to control the children, by people swapping seats constantly and by members of the family bringing more toddlers and babies from other cabins to socialise. This wasn't a business class experience; it was being in a creche for a day. The cabin crew were beside themselves with trying to control the situation.

Qatar use the Escape lounges at Manchester which now has a separate business lounge with hot meal options. The flight was 40 minutes late departing from Manchester and as I only had one hour transit in Doha I was concerned about getting my connection, the cabin crew were very supportive and kept checking the likely arrival time and explained if I missed my flight there was another Bangkok flight not long afterwards, they found out the gate number of my flight and made sure I was the first person off the aircraft. Flight was excellent, seats comfortable even for passengers of my height I've always considered the food on Qatar to be the best with lots of choice a decent choice of entertainment on the video channels. I did make my connection but it was a bit tight. Outgoing flights were on  A330 / A340 while returning aircraft's were Boeing 777 / 787. In my opinion little to choose between them although the 787 has the best seating 1x2x1, all aircraft's had been changed since I first booked, not a huge problem apart from having to forever change your preferred seat on the Qatar website. Being able to pre-order your main meal in advance was new although it's only on flights from Doha at present. Outstanding flight crews on all four flights, friendly and attentive to your needs a credit to Qatar Airways. Due to short transit time didn't have time to visit the business class lounge at Hamad International Airport although I did manage a short time there on my flight home.

Check in at Manchester was very good, the ladies on Business class were fast and very funny and it was an enjoyable experience. The business class lounge was a disappointment. The plane had the new style seats fitted - in my opinion these are not as good as the old seats. Sitting in the window seat with the passenger in the aisle seat fully reclined, it needs mountaineering skills to get to the aisle. Also, the window seat has very restricted room for your feet when fully reclined. The IFE was OK but I struggled to find anything that I really wanted to watch. By far the worst aspect (and this applies to Emirates A380 too) was the almost total lack of room for your elbows, you are very restricted. The cabin service on the outbound flight was superb, the food was good and the provision of non alcoholic Champagne is very welcome to any teetotallers travelling. On the return journey the check in was superb and very efficient. The business class lounge was crowded and there was a queue for the toilets but they were kept clean.

A small disappointment was that none of the four items I selected from the in-flight duty free catalog was available. I would also have liked the Indian government landing card provided on board as it would avoid some hassle before the immigration counter on arrival.

Three of us were travelling under two bookings and the online facility was not allowing me to sit with two of my family. Luckily at check-in this was rectified so we were provided with 2 blocks of 3 seats for both legs. The flight was amended out of KUL so we missed the A350 and were changed to QR15 which was 2 hours later into LHR. Both planes left on time. Toilets were clean although water was not draining from the sink hole. Food was good - I had potatoes gratin with random white fish served with the usual roll and some trimmings. The sandwich on serving 2 is not a sandwich but a dough slice. Wine volume has been reduced ( I fly Qatar 2/3 times per year ) and I was given 85 ml on my first serving and 100ml on my second serving. Qatar normally provides 187mm bottles and on a 7 hour leg you always get 3 if you ask. IFE screen was only partially responsive; headset had a loose connection resulting in sporadic audio connection. Seat 18 J was broken so my family was split up. The USB connection did not work so I could not easily charge my phone. The seatbelt sign was on for over 3 hours of leg one so the coffee didn't materialize until I requested it.

The difference is night & day! From booking to boarding there is nothing that is too much trouble for Qatar Airways staff. Onboard you will find spotless aircraft, in my case the fabulous A350 between Muscat and Doha and the equally pleasant 787-8 Doha to Edinburgh. You will also experience a crew that are not only efficient but also value you as a passenger. Although I was travelling in Business class both the Muscat - Doha and Doha - Muscat sectors are ticketed in First which allowed me access to the First Class lounge at Doha airport. This far exceeds the lounges offered by BA in both Edinburgh and T5 Heathrow. Both aircraft provided comfortable seating and decent IFE in the ""Oryx One"" system. Food and beverage service is excellent with Qatar offering an ""eat on request"" service which eliminates the requirement of a food cart. Meals are served individually on white linen with proper cutlery and tableware. There was an excellent choice of refreshments to accompany meals and additional snacks and refreshments can be requested throughout the flight. I recognize that Qatar Airways are not the cheapest option but in a ""value for money"" comparison with other available carriers I feel they are a very good choice.

He noticed my mother sitting in the middle seat squeezed in and very uncomfortable, and he said he will move her to a more comfortable spot once the service ends. Food on board this flight was sub par. The 777's seats are tight, and  overhead bins get filled up very quickly. Transfer in Doha was really tight, with no time to spare. The next flight to Milan was an A330. I prefer 2-4-2 configuration more than 3-3-3 or 3-4-3 configuration, as couples can sit together. On this flight, the crew were much more experienced, friendly and professional.  On the return flight, check in at Rome was worse than Bangkok. Boeing 787 roomy atmosphere on board all added to a great flight. The seats are very comfortable and felt like an armchair in full recline. The crew on this flight were fantastic. After breakfast service, I went to talk to the cabin senior in the galley, and he had some spare business class meals, and he obliged me to try them, and he also gave me some snacks, which was everything an avgeek could ask for. Before landing, he asked me if wanted to try the business class seats. On the flight to Bangkok, it was another 777, and the crew were still excellent.

Boarding Boeing 787 was efficient. Aircraft hot until about 15 minutes after departure. Legroom and space felt very limited, especially with the IFE box under the non-middle seats, but it wasn't the nightmare I had geared myself up to expect. It took a while for water to be distributed, a small bottle of water on each seat would go far to passive passenger until the first service. Water only available in tiny glasses, no larger containers or bottles available. Transfer at Doha efficient, the benefits of bus service is they open both front and rear doors, so the five minutes you spend on the airport tour is mitigated by the ten minutes saved by non-bridge disembarking.

Being Ramadan (although a night flight and we were traveling when Ramadan restrictions are lifted), that may have been a problem too, but a colleague at work had the same problem a month or two before when flying to Australia and it was not Ramadan, and refused to fly himself or his family on Qatar again because of that. However, one of the hostesses was extremely good and saved the day by going up front and bringing me back a large paper coffee cup with a decent quantity of beer in it - which I appreciated because I did not want to be insensitive to those around me since in economy anyway and it was Ramadan so fine to have it in a paper cup for all involved - including me, as Qatar ought to be sensitive to my wants too as I am also a paying customer. Although the cabin was modern and clean and the staff brilliant I felt sorry for anyone who would have to fly in such cramped seats internationally. Qatar now have  10 across on the 777, instead of 9. Things improved dramatically when I got to Doha and travelled onto New York. The new A350 is an absolutely beautiful plane to fly on. For business class, much better than the A380, despite no bar. It is more intimate, service is much better (the hosts on the A380 being overstretched with so many to serve) and the plane is so silent and smooth with good air quality you really notice. Brilliant hard product on this plane, brilliant service, quite good food (although Qatar has gone a little down-hill the last 2/3 years on that front - I remember the Beluga Caviar starters I used to get back then), great in flight entertainment, and a good nights sleep after my bed was made up. Their business product puts most others to shame, although I hope they aim back at trying to make it a business class product as good as first again. Flight home from New York was pretty much a mirror image, although the food was really not up to par with what I am used to on Qatar.",Boeing 777 / A350,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Kuwait to New York via Doha,2017-06-01,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,4,yes,Kuwait,New York ,qatar airways

The bar in A380 helps to relax and and socialize with fellow passengers. Cons: only a few business lounges so outside of Qatar it's difficult to have true Qatar Airways experience before taking off.

Bangkok ground staff are polite, but during boarding, it was the most chaotic scene. The Boeing 777-300 uses the 3-4-3 configuration. On this flight, the flight attendant serving my section was sub par of what I'm used to at Qatar airways. The food was fantastic. The flight to Frankfurt was on a brand new A350, with wide seats a the tail camera. I really like the exterior cameras! The flight attendant who was friends with another flight attendant I met before, and was polite and very friendly.  On the return leg from Vienna, 4 counters open with few passengers. This time, the cabin was only 40% full, so I moved rows and had a whole row to myself. The catering from European airports is always good, so my braised beef with potato au gratin was excellent. The flight attendant I met remembered what I wanted and made the service so personalised it was like a first class flight in economy! She is the best flight attendant I've ever met! In the rear galley, I also met a Bhutanese and Moroccan flight attendant who were equally as nice. But the nicest of them all has to be the Cabin Services Director who came to my seat just before landing to say hello, and we exchanged pleasantries. During disembarkation, I asked if I was able to get a photo with the captain. While waiting for the captain to come out of the cockpit, I was able to try out the business class seat and found it superior to Cathay Pacific's product.

Check-in and crew onboard are diligent and almost faultless. Food, despite 3 choices offered, was not so good and continues to be of poorer and poorer quality and amounts. Completely inedible plastic sandwiches provided ""in lieu"" of proper meal to escape a second hot meal service. Poor wines. Alcoholic drinks were available but not disclosed due to Ramadan. We travelled two persons and were given 3-4 adjacent seats on both flights thus amble space. Elite fliers well respected and cared for. Lounge access working but the denial of access to Al Mourjan lounge in Doha hits hard: their elite flier lounges are not up to the game.

"""this trip was the best so far""",10.0,David Graubard,2017-06-14,"✅ Verified Review |  May 12, flew ORD-DOH-DEL on QR 726/QR578 in Business Class. Qatar has never been anything but amazing and this trip was the best so far. Check-in agents were really fun and nice and checked the bag to Delhi. The only let-down of the entire trip was the lounge Qatar uses at O'Hare. The Air France/KLM lounge is shared by about 13 airlines so it is packed! This lounge should not allow more than a couple airlines to use it - nice food spread but too crowded and bad wifi. Wish Qatar shared the BA lounge here. Anyways we boarded on-time and the service started immediately. The friendly attendant came and introduced herself to my friend and me, handed out pyjamas and talked about the amenity kit that was already at our seats along with slippers and the blanket/duvet for sleeping. The purser then came to introduce herself and drinks were delivered after with a smile. Menus handed out and as Qatar does dine-on-demand you can eat anytime. It's much easier for the attendants as they don't have to serve everyone at once, but I can see how it can be arduous at times. Pushed back a bit late and a greeting from the flight deck for the 13.30 hour flight to Doha. Chose to eat dinner and watch movies - their AVOD is very good but not as good as Emirates. But their service kicks Emirates a million times over. So after dinner made up my bed and slept 6 hours but the flight was quite turbulent. Woke and washed up in the bathroom and my meal was ready for me - timed well from the excellent attendant. The only thing they could enhance is offering wifi on their 777-300 planes. That is where they are not as competitive as Emirates or Etihad. Landed 20 min late into Doha and a smooth transfer into the Al-Mourjan Business class lounge for some food and a nice shower. 2 hour connection was timed perfect and boarded our 787 for the 3 1/2 hour flight to Delhi. The 787 is much newer but my friend and I both preferred the 777-300ER biz seats. But still a great service and watched some Breaking Bad until a 2am ontime arrive into Delhi. Immigration was busy but got the bags and out to the taxi in 45 minutes. Qatar pushes things to a new level- even when flying them in coach it's pleasant.

The crew were polite and the cabin senior from Bangladesh was the most outstanding crew member I have had in a while. He was older, wiser and had a knack for making me feel at home given the old plane and a poor inflight entertainment options.

The onward leg to Cape Town was in the Boeing 787.

"""food in general was a let down""",7.0,Arron Zidane,2017-05-09,"✅ Verified Review |  London to Khartoum via Doha on Qatar Airways. My flight from LHR to Doha was on a A350 and its a great plane with very comfortable economy seating and leg room even though I am a large chap, the crew done their job perfectly well and no issues on this flight. I had a 2hr layover at Hamad International and it is a great airport and the transfer was smooth and efficient. The flight to Khartoum was on a A320 from a remote stand so a bus journey to the plane ensure and the seats on this was somewhat smaller and although not entirely uncomfortable was a bit squeezed in. The food served was 2 pastries, one sweet and one savoury which felt a bit weird. Landing at what is probably one of the worst airports in Africa was smooth and no issues with luggage. The return flight a week later, the plane was delayed for 2hrs with no a information from Qatar Airways or airport staff and Qatar ground staff did finally appear when boarding was announced they blamed the delay on no gates being available at the airport, no apologies or anything. I found the plane not very clean, rather old and had no IFE apart from overhead screens. No delay apology was made by the Captain and the food served was spicy lamb meatballs with dill rice which was a bit of a weird meal for what was supposed to be a 2am departure and on arrival at Doha we was once again at a remote stand and bussed to the terminal where I had a 1 1/2hr transit. The flight to London was on a A380 and the seating was very comfortable and the service from the crew was good although the food was terrible. - some sort of scrambled egg, dry frankfurter and some sauteed mushrooms and the snack served prior to landing was chicken in some sort of flat bread wrap that was bland. It seems that the service on routes like to/from Khartoum leaves a lot to be desired as does the fact that they still use remote stands and the food in general was a let down.

Then found the Boeing 787 to Cape Town changed at last minute to Boeing 777-300. There was an air of frantic rush here as we were herded on plane when we should have departed. The seats were so unfortunately and no power for my medical equipment. Unlike previous flight staff did not know of my medical request and so I had a horrendous flight with no sleep. Again kids meal were drab and left though IFE worked better.

"""trend of 3-4-3 in Economy""",5.0,John Fairclough,2017-03-31,"✅ Verified Review |  Barcelona to Bangkok return via Doha. Economic reality dictates these days that my QR flying has now to be in Economy, not Biz.  Both BCN sectors were in A330, which, though a little dated are a perfectly acceptable plane for a 6 hr flight. Still nice to have the 2-4-2 layout that enables a couple travelling to be able to sit by themselves. Doha to BKK was in an A380, which is a wonderful plane. The little Economy sector on the upper deck is as good as it gets in Economy, in my opinion, with great seats, and plenty of space, but from what I saw, the lower deck is almost as good. Which is why I was so disappointed when I found out that the Bangkok to Doha section was changed to a B777 300. What a come-down, QR felt fit to follow the trend of 3-4-3 in Economy, instead of the 3-3-3 . This cabin is seriously cramped. It was impossible to pass in the aisle if there was a large person or trolley in it, and no elbow room to eat etc in any seat. These people need to get the message that they cannot go squeezing yet more seats into already overcrowded jets to make a fast buck. Cannot speak for other carriers, but the difference on QR between their A380 offering and the 773 offering is embarrassing.

Outbound on A330 and inbound on the Boeing 787. After a horrendous journey through London to get to Heathrow, I was escorted to the front of the check-in queue and allowed to use Business Class check-in to make the 1 hour cutoff for my flight. Overnight flight from London to Doha was on time and unremarkable other than for some bizarre reason the main cabin lights were not switched off during the flight. Fortunately Qatar's economy amenities kit is good and features an eyemask, which was needed on this occasion. Legroom in seat 20K was poor due to the IFE box under the seat in front. Food was good and cabin crew were very polite. Hot towels served on boarding and in the morning which is a nice touch. The really good Qatar service came on transfer in Doha. After freshening up I made my way to the boarding gate for the Doha-Bali leg, to find an incredibly long queue for what was clearly a full flight. At the boarding gate, the agent switched my boarding pass and only after passing through the gate did I realise he had upgraded me to business class! The onboard business class service was impeccable. The seats were clean, had multiple recline positions and plenty of room to store belongings you wanted access to in-flight. There was a good pre-flight drinks service (including champagne), the amenities kit was excellent (featuring Armani products) and the cabin crew were the most polite and attentive I've ever encountered. Throughout the flight there was an on-demand meal service, superb wine list (including a Sauternes dessert wine) and the bathrooms were cleaned by a member of cabin staff after every use by a passenger. Absolutely faultless service. What's more, I did not feel that the staff treated me any differently just because I had the fortune to have been upgraded for free instead of having paid full price for the experience. Return flights in economy were very good and better than the outbound LHR-DOH leg: this had a lot to do with the Boeing 787 plane, which had far better lighting and more spacious seats, which made sleeping far easier. I had a window seat and appreciate the tinted window function on the Dreamliner. Again, cabin crew were excellent and the food was very good for economy class. IFE options were very good. Ground staff and gate agents on transfer in Doha some of the politest I've ever encountered.

A pleasant overnighter, departing Kuala Lumpur at 02:00, on which I got more than six hours sleep on the Boeing 787. I love this aircraft's cabin air quality. The seat is great and the 1-2-1 Business cabin is cosier than Qatar's A350 or 380. It left right on time. The Doha to London sector was a 777 with an older 2-2-2 layout and product, which my partner and I are usually quite happy with. But it does look and feel dated, compared with the latest Qatar Airways Business product. My seat seemed to dangle at the end, so didn't go completely flat. Still, this aircraft type will shortly be retrofitted with Qatar's latest Q Suite.

"""last flight was disappointing""",7.0,Pierre Barreche,2017-03-18,"✅ Verified Review |  My last flight from Doha to New York JFK was disappointing. Upon boarding, a couple in Business Class insisted to have their child, booked in Economy, upgraded and made a scene when it could not be arranged. In the process, several passengers were asked to change seats, some accepting and some not. The FAs stood by. The old Business Class seats in Boeing 777s are well below those found elsewhere. The food and amenity kits have been very downgraded. The winesremain very good. If you happen to like dark chocolate, you are not in luck. The boxes of four have been replaced by single milk pieces. The robot-like unsmiling service (with the exception of the perfectly charming Flight Service Director who acknowledged the facts and wrote her own report) was performed with no grace. Call buttons had to be pressed several times to be acknowledged. My IFE handset was unreliable, touch screen on the main video is too far to be easily accessed.

"""Good food, excellent wines""",9.0,Anders Pedersen,2017-03-11,"✅ Verified Review |  Kuala Lumpur to Copenhagen via Doha in March 2017. The ticket was the return travel on an extremely cheap economy ticket purchased for less than 500 USD several months prior to travel. Despite the ticket is in O-class, and thus not upgradable, they sent me an offer 2 weeks before to pay 400 USD extra for the last sector to CPH. I could not resist as this also gave me access to Al Mourjan Lounge in Doha, where I spent 15 hours, which I don’t mind. First sector: in Kuala Lumpur I tried all 3 lounges offered (Plaza Premium, Golden Business, and First Class). All were good. As the flight was only 30-40% full and as I am elite flyer they gave me 4 seats on the A340-600 to stretch out. In economy I was pampered throughout.

The staff was nice, and answered all my questions. Apparently, the flight was overbooked. After tweeting this, Qatar airways was more than apologetic.  Boarding was orderly, and a flight attendant greeted me at the door. When I got to my row, I met a Canadian flight attendant who started conversations with everyone and did this throughout the flight if she wasn't busy.  She was very polite. Actually, all the flight attendants were polite and smiling. All of my flights left slightly late. The seat is comfortable however I had the last row so I had limited recline. Seats on the A380 and A350 are the same, and are very wide and comfortable. Legroom is sufficient for a 13 hour flight. One thing I would suggest they add would be a footrest. The TV screen is big, and touch screen responsive, rendering the remote useless. The food onboard was excellent. On the legs to and from Bangkok, The flight attendants saved a meal choice just for us. Try to choose the beef. Most of the time they have braised beef and potatoes, or spiced chicken. They are a bit sluggish, but still smile whenever they're interacting with passengers. I found the  red wine to be low quality. I didn't like all of the audio selections, but at least they had 5 Celine Dion and 4 Michael Jackson albums, which kept me entertained. Movie selection is good. During deplaning, the flight attedant gave me a tour of the upper deck including the bar, business and first class. During transit in Doha, security check is much more organised than Taipei or Narita airport, but there a rude staff member at gate check who refused to let me board with my friend who was a Gold card member. On the return flight, I met a nice lady at check in who was having conversations with me and appreciated me trying to speak French. During flight, one Romanian attendant asked me to help translate, and she was very friendly and had conversations with me. On the flight to bangkok, there was a Malaysian flight attendant who was also very nice and talkative (I'm also talkative) so we had too much conversation, she wasn't able to service other passengers.

I'm happy to say It was not. You just relax into it, especially in business class. This is a wide bodied aircraft which felt quite spacious in business having 6 seats to the row and a large personal tv screen for all the movies. The food was fantastic - having had a beef meal on the previous flight, I chose a Nobu lightly spicy broth with seafood followed by a fabulous red snapper, saffron cream and asparagus and the wines worthy of this airline which was deservedly voted having the best wine cellar in the sky. (Ch. Brane Cantanac red, fine Chablis and Babich Sauvignon from Marlborough NZ). Best of all was the flexibility about when to eat and being such a long flight, there was a constant supply of bottled water, cups of tea and snacks. The seating arrangement works well with easy access to the aisles although a little more storage space for the things we want beside us on a long haul flight would have been more helpful.

This was a mixed Business/Economy fare (which was really good value) with Sydney to Doha in Business and Economy onwards to Vienna and the same back to Doha from London. I unwittingly got to travel in all three classes and can only say positive things about this airline. Business Class from Sydney to Doha was great really nice cabin and seat, well thought out with loads of storage space. The wine selection was also outstanding (I am a wine buff), food a bit more average. A really good flight and the lounge in Doha is excellent, if a little hard to find. Business felt like a real 'treat' and was a really nice way to start a holiday. Economy to and from Europe was decent enough - but especially coming back in the A380. Try and get a seat upstairs at the back of Business - small cabin with it's own toilets and only about 8-10 rows. I managed to score the front row so had heaps of leg room. From Doha back to Sydney they upgraded me to First from Business - what a treat! The Krug and caviar went down a treat and every aspect of the flight was excellent. I was really impressed by Qatar Airways and feel it is superior to both Qantas and Emirates.

I will overfly my destination and give myself a layover in Doha because they are were so good. I arrived with my 11 year old son very early for check in Madrid. So much so they were still checking in the early flight to Doha. QR 150 not 152. But they checked me in early superb service from the check in staff. A male boarding supervisor came and destroyed 8 years of perfect customer satisfaction in a few minutes. He informed me that I was welcome to use the silver lounge pass but my 11 year old son (minor) was not. This cost was incurred by Qatar Airways and despite he being registered as a minor family member he would not be able to use the facilities in Madrid as they cost Qatar Airways too much money and they had to pay for this service. A family member and a minor. He then confidently called the previous female supervisor who Qatar Airways should be very proud to have a an employee for her courteous and professional demeanor and manner who promptly over-ruled his decision and issued my 11 year old (minor) accompanying passenger to sit with his only accompanying passenger in the Iberia VIP lounge in terminal 4s. Having flown no airline but Qatar Airways for the last 7-8 years occasionally overflying my destination and having long layovers in one of the nicest airports in the world this will no longer be the case as matter of course.

"""has my vote as the best""",9.0,J Simms,2017-02-03,"✅ Verified Review |  Philadelphia to Denpasar Bali via Doha. Before choosing Qatar Airways for our flight to Bali, I studied many, many reviews of a number of different airlines which led to my choosing Qatar Airways for our flight to Bali. I booked these tickets myself online, so was a bit anxious about any hitches that might occur, since this was the first time for both a flight of this magnitude and my unfamiliarity with this airline. I am so very happy I chose them because of the many flights I have taken, both inside the US and internationally, Qatar Airways currently has my vote as the best - for service, for seating and for overall efficiency and pleasant travel. Check-in, both in the US and in Bali was exceptional: Fast, efficient and friendly. I am mobility-impaired, and need a wheelchair for distances in the airport. I cannot stress the exceptional quality of care that was given to me, from the point of entry into the Qatar area. Not only in terms of fast, friendly transport through check-in, customs, security and onto the planes, but once I was entered into their system as mobility-impaired at the first airport, we were upgraded to more comfortable seating: very helpful. Service on the planes was impeccable. Staff was friendly, attentive (note, these were almost 13 and 10 hour flights, so staff were on for long hours) to requests and periodically checked, even if no requests were made. I pre-ordered meals (not necessary, I discovered unless you really do want special meals) and was able to change the request while in-flight. Meals, both vegetarian and non-vegetarian options, were tasty (on the way out particularly, featured a lot of protein), were plentiful and beautifully served. Since when on US flights do we get served with real silverware?  Plenty of individual entertainment options; a nice seat pack that included eyeshades, ear plugs,and other goodies; good blanket; good earphones, etc. Kids get special treatment with extra goodies - and maybe as a result (or else we had exceptional parents, babies and children both ways), little crying or loud kiddie noises during these long, exhausting flights). I could go on and on, but suffice it to say, I look forward to flying Qatar Airways again, and am recommending it to people I know as an excellent option. I have no clue as to what happens in business and first class, but I would say have no qualms about booking economy seats on Qatar Airways. One additional thing: Next time, I intend to make a stopover in Doha, especially on the way back, because flying to Southeast Asia seemed easier than the return, maybe due to time differences, we had actually been awake much longer. But also because Doha looks fascinating. I will at the least plan a longer layover, because from the airport, on can actually get 3 or 5 hour city tours.

"""it was an awesome flight""",9.0,A Hafiri,2017-01-28,"✅ Verified Review |  Paris CDG to Doha. Qatar Airways is such a nice airline to fly with. From the check in experience until the arrival is amazing, however it has a few flaws. From the check in, they checked me all the way to Kuala Lumpur, everything went nice and smooth. I am Indonesian living in Jakarta so ground staff asked me that if I do have the ticket to Jakarta or not and I explained I want to spend time in Kuala Lumpur and have the ticket to CGK. Here's a little tip, I recommend that you guys should check-in via web since Qatar Airways provided a faster lane for web check-in users, however they still print the boarding pass so it's no need to print on your own, you just only have to complete your personal info. Hence after check-in, I directly headed to the boarding gate, it has no problem and everything went smooth. Boarding to the aircraft, I was greeted by the warmf flight attendants. Our seat located on the front was shown by the FA. My sister wanted to take a pic with the FA and she is very nice and friendly to her. Before departure, my sister which is 10 yo was given a colorful monopoly bag with board games for entertainment. However after 10 minutes taxiing, the aircraft was going back to the gate due to some trouble (which wasn't told to the passenger) and we had a delay of an hour, so that they gave us free water or juice. After 1.5 hours taxiing, we finally leave Paris. Inside the A380, the seat is quite different with the A340s and 777s of Qatar, it has the neck rest. It is actually quite good for me, a person taller than 5'7"", however it could be a disaster for a person with lower height. The cabin crew handed out dinner.  The meal was pretty awesome and had a rich taste (keep in mind that arabian food has lots of spices in their food which is great). Another thing is that I can actually fill a water bottle to make me keep hydrated even when i remain seated so that i do not need to call the fa for some drinks. After the meal, I discover the in-flight entertainment and it was pretty cool. The screen was big and it was very responsive (in comparasion to the 777s of Qatar's). It also have the mini PDA-like remote which is very responsive. Qatar Airways offer new movies, and I watched 2 new movies during this sector. However, the A380s doesn't seem to have wider collections rather than the 777s. During the flight, free wi-fi for economy passengers is offered for a limit (15 minutes, 10MB). The internet connection was horrible however I manage to chat with a few people though. 2 hours prior to landing, served a snack and coffee. Also during the hours we suffer some turbulences but the cabin crew manage to handle professionally.

"""trip has been a mixed bag""",6.0,N Smales,2017-01-07,"✅ Verified Review |  This trip has been a mixed bag with the outbound flight from Adelaide to Oslo via Doha being essentially good and without incident. However the return trip open jaw from Barcelona after a cruise was a different matter. The onboard experience on the flight from Barcelona to Doha was good and our hostess for our section of the plane was outstanding, but ground staff at Barcelona left a lot to be desired particularly for business passengers. We arrived before the check in start time and had to wait for staff to arrive and set themselves up. After the check in staff arrived they played with their computers, talked amongst themselves and had a meeting without providing any explanation to waiting of passengers who were left waiting for 30 minutes. When we finally checked in our bags they were tagged as ""long transfer"" routing them direct to Adelaide without any explanation been given of the implications. When we arrived in the early hours of the morning in Doha were we advised by the transfer desk that we could not have access to our checked luggage. Hence we were left without spare clothing, toiletries and essential medications for our less than 24 hour stopover. It was by chance that we had some essential items in our cabin luggage. The transfer desk operative attitude to our predicament was most uncustomer friendly. We believe that Qatar should have informed us of the requirement to pack the items we required for the stopover in our cabin bags when they advised that our booked flight had been changed neccessitating the stop over. The Oryx airline hotel was good but as business passengers we felt that a private car would have been more appropropriate than waiting for a minibus to take us to the hotel. The customer service at the Doha airport for business class passengers is inconsistent with the service around the check in area verging on overkill while after passengers have been processed they are left to wander around the airport in search of the business lounge. Doha to Adelaide was mixed with some cabin staff providing excellent service while others were lazy. I was not offered a mattress or breakfast while my wife on the other aisle received excellent service. I experienced extreme difficulty in having our flights credited to our respective frequent flyer accounts, (which I believe should be automatically recorded when making the booking as the FF codes are shown on our boarding passes). I have sent two emails via the Qatar frequent flyer webpage which have been ignored. Customer service in Australia appears to be non existent!

"""huge deterioration of service""",7.0,Anders Pedersen,2017-01-04,"✅ Verified Review |  I travelled CPH-DOH-BKK on 1st and 2nd January 2017 - on B788 and B77W, respectively. Check-in counter in CPH puzzled me as QR now start to disallow checking in luggage further than the first tickets end-destination. That is a huge downfall as in this case I will have to check in my luggage again in Bangkok – this, despite that my next carrier is their Oneworld alliance member, Malaysia Airlines. That cost me an hour and a half extra struggle in BKK due to cease of this baggage further transfer service – this is an unacceptable change and huge deterioration of service - likely inspired by BA who recently stopped offering further luggage transfers. All flights on time. Poor lounge offered in CPH, a third party lounge called Aspire – likely the most boring lounge in the world. Pre-departure drinks in CPH offered but with soft drinks only. When QR departs from any other Scandinavian Airport like OSL, HEL, or ARN they offer full drink service predeparture – why can’t they do it in CPH? Menu had no seafood, fish, or lamb. Icecream offered but they ran out of stock before they reached my seat 4A, despite having initially ordered. No smoothies. Cheeseplate available. Good wines and spirits. 3 beers offered, provide no alternative as they are almost identical and dull in taste (Corona, Heineken, and Foster). FAs did a great job. Lounge in Doha excellent. Second flight DOH-BKK with equipment change due to poor load factor to mobilise the A380 and was changed to an older B777-300ER without 1st class and bar. Pre-departure drinks included champagne. The seats could not go horizontal, only some 165 degrees angle – but were fully flat. Food and drink service excellent and pyjamas and kits were given out.

After take-off the crew took my orders and service was one of the quickest, unfortunately my meal option went out. But not too bad I then went with the Arabic chicken for main which was amazing, as a starter I chose salmon along with potato salad and for dessert they offered ice cream. The crew was amazing and friendly. They often came and brought chocolate, cookies and drinks. The only thing I wish is free Wi-Fi for Business passengers and for their Elites. Because you pay a lot money and with Wi-Fi you could answer mails or just simply browse the web. The transfer at their Doha hub was quick and well organized. But the line for Business passengers was a bit too full. After that I went to their amazing lounge. The second flight was not as good as the first one. It was departing in the morning and arriving in the evening. They only had breakfast option and no lunch or dinner options. But at least the catered option tasted amazing and were top.

Slimline seats on Boeing 777 actually more comfortable than more traditional seats on the A380 although it seemed like a newer plane. Not too many announcements apart from at beginning and end of flight which is good compared to some carriers constantly trying to sell duty free etc. Main complaint would be the food and drink service. The food was just OK and they are very stingy with alcoholic drinks. They had the small wine bottles (187.5ml) but poured them in to a glass and saved the remaining 50mls or so for the next passenger, this seemed very like cost cutting at its most obvious.

"""journey above average""",8.0,C Lin,2016-12-06,"Delhi to Edinburgh via Doha. I chose Qatar Airways as I was very curious about the Dreamliner that Boeing and many people were talking about. I wanted to feel for myself the spacious layout, the more natural cabin pressure closer to the ground, and the larger colour-changing windows. When I boarded the aircraft, there was a little lounge between the business and the economy classes, so it did feel very spacious. The design of the over-head luggage compartments also made it feel more spacious than other aircraft when you standing in the aisle. Were the windows larger? I was not sure - maybe, as I could see the ground from my aisle seat. There was definitely a difference in the cabin pressure - during taking-off and landing, I did not feel any pain in my ears. The leg room was not tight, but somehow I did not feel it was as comfortable as I was imagining. I just felt lack of support on my back and my feet never feel too relaxed. Also, there was a box under the front seat in all A and C seats (I guess it is the same for the other side, too), taking up quite a lot of space. In terms of the service, it was pretty good. One of my stereo earphone jacks in 19H did not work, so the flight attendants changed me to 20D. The food was OK, but far from amazing. I really enjoyed the omelette and chicken sausage on Flight 579 from Delhi to Doha - the omelette, the sausage and the mushrooms were tender, succulent and full of flavours, but the same dish on QR29 from Doha to Edinburgh was oddly very dry, tough and obviously overcooked. The in-flight entertainment was good - there were 35 new movies to choose from, on top of other older movies. They claimed to offer WiFi on board, but I could not connect to it, or even when I was connected, it was not usable (not even to browse the web).

Two years ago I was able to drink Pol Roger Rosé Vintage 2006 and now it is Lanson Rosé. Same changes in the variety of food and drinks in the Biz lounge in Doha. Never been my favorite, due to its immense size, it feels more like a train station than a lounge. Another change is the frequency of time changes with Qatar now: My first leg of this trip was changed 4 times back and forward, last time about two weeks before departure date. Inconvenient, because I had a meeting before in Stockholm and had to change my agenda and that of others several times as well. This is not the way you can do business.

The overall experience was low stress and helped me manage my anxiety which was incredibly important given that I have a severe fear of flying. Being able to go through the much shorter Business class TSA line, being able to decompress in the lounge prior to boarding and having priority boarding made the lead up to the actual flight a positive one. Onboard the plane, the staff were friendly and service was top notch. Seats were comfortable with plenty of room to stretch out, get up and walk around. Noise cancellation headphones helped drown out the engine and ambient noise which helped my mental state. The PJs and amenity kit were great, providing great comfort and warmth. The overall inflight cabin experience was really great, hats off to really good cabin crews Qatar Airways. Arrival and lay-over at Hamad International Airport was smooth, efficient, and comfortable. I love the Al Mourjan business lounge. Being able to take a shower and decompress from the stress of flying in such a lovely and spacious environment before continuing on my journey was a necessity I didn't realize I needed. Love the shower rooms and the food in either restaurant (there are two in the lounge) was great. Having separate areas was smart and the quiet area is fantastic for catching up on some sleep between flights. Didn't do any shopping at Hamad but they looked like they had quite a lot to offer. The second leg of my journey also went smoothly. Upon arrival being ahead of the main rush was good and my bags were off the belt within the first 10 that arrived. Business class tickets aren't cheap but for the level of service, the quality of the product and the amenities that you get with Qatar Airways, it was money well spent and an experience I will happily pay for again in the future.

I can't think of any other airlines that match the standards of Qatar Airways. Excellent check-in facilities at Manchester, Qatar don't have their own lounge here and use the Escape lounge which isn't the best as now they've merged the business class and normal lounge so it's crowded and noisy but very helpful staff. Since I originally booked, Qatar changed the transit time in Doha and the aircraft on both legs of the journey, Manchester to Doha is now a Boeing 787, an improvement on the A330, but Doha to Bangkok is now a Boeing 777 which isn't up to the standard of the A380. However once onboard it's the service that matters not the aircraft, and this is where Qatar excels. The flight attendants are helpful and attentive,  the food is probably the best you'll get on a flight, the entertainment is good with a choice of movies to suit most tastes. The 787 is a fine aircraft however I found the seats in business slightly uncomfortable probably due to being 6'5"" as the end of the seat was halfway down the back of my thighs and I needed to recline the seat. The 777 feels old now compared to the 787 and A380, the business cabin seems cramped due to the 2x2x2 layout. All flights arrived early despite one being delayed due to some passengers in economy wanting to pick were they wanted to sit rather than were they were allocated. Ground staff in Bangkok also excellent, Qatar Airways will soon have their own lounge there rather than use the Thai lounge.

"""I have high expectations when flying Qatar""",6.0,Bojan Tercon,2016-11-09,"✅ Verified Review |  Was very excited to fly on the A350 from Doha to Frankfurt. My first time. Though when I got onboard there really wasn't much of a noticeable difference. I think the Dreamliner already took all the excitement out of this new jet! Spacious cabin. Quiet engines. Impressive entrance. The Dreamliner had first mover advantage. Granted, the engines were very quiet, even at takeoff. Although interior design wise, I found the overhead bins to be very low when open. I whacked my head a few times when getting stuff out. I love the seat on this plane. Very comfortable and private, since you face into the window. One of the best. I have high expectations when flying Qatar for I have had many amazing flights with them. This, unfortunately, was not one of them. The food was so-so (steak was very tough) and I found the IFE on this new A350 very cumbersome to use. I couldn't for the longest time get the touch screen to work. Perhaps it was a single incident. I hope so. I did like the gimmicky 3D map feature on the IFE. It worked similarly to Google maps. You could zoom in/out with your fingers, move the map around thus felt somewhat interactive. The front camera view captivated me for you could actually see the front landing gear during takeoff and landing, which is good at the actual moment of touchdown. I love big windows, however, the windows on this A350 annoyed me. In order to close the shades with the electronic button you had to reach way down between the wall and the panel of your seat. Was very difficult to reach. I was expecting a button on the control panel to close the windows, but alas none. Very badly designed seat/window for the wall paneling of the seat by your head is too high and covers the window buttons.

"""A350 business cabin spacious and airy""",8.0,B Mandeno,2016-11-06,"✅ Verified Review |  I flew New York to Doha return on an A350 in Business Class in late October. The plane is quite new, and the business cabin is spacious and airy. There are no overhead bins over center seats, giving the 1-2-1 configured cabin a sense of spaciousness. The seats were truly excellent - spacious, with plenty of nooks and crannies to store things, and with an excellent entertainment system. All of the hardware was truly first rate, which made the less-than-stellar soft-product all the more disappointing. The drawback to the seat configuration is that people travelling together in the center are so far apart that it's hard to converse in a low tone of voice. The food was quite tasty and nicely presented. The cabin attendants did their jobs, and nothing more. The service was polite, perfunctory, and when they finished, they disappeared behind the galley curtains. So much so that some children who got bored started racing around the cabin bumping into seats, waking up their occupants, and then, when they tired of that, they started taking out the life vests and playing with them. It was literally hours before one of the cabin attendants stumbled upon half a dozen life vests strewn on the floor. If there had been an emergency, those vests would have been needed. The cabin attendant merely picked them up and took them with him behind the curtain. The wifi was terrible on both flights. Frequently out of signal, and when there was signal, the speed was atrocious. Barely enough to send and receive emails without attachments. The lavatories were not always maintained to good standard. Overall the experience was not bad, but t was just not particularly great.",A350,Business,Business Class,JFK to MCT via DOH,2016-10-01,5.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4,yes,JFK,MCT ,qatar airways

It started off quite badly for me when they asked for credit card verification, then kept asking for more. In the air, service and comfort was quite good, and the economy class food was quite good. Three of my flights were on the A350 which is the best of the new aircraft, quite spacious in economy - lots of legroom but the width was a bit cramped, despite being wider than the 787. The Boeing 777 was 10-across and horrible, especially in the middle two seats. At least it was only two hours, but it shows that aircraft selection has a big impact on economy comfort. Apart from the 777, which was unfortunately packed, the other flights were quite empty, increasing the comfort levels and meaning that they offered quite reasonable upgrades on every one of my legs. I got it for the last flight and it was what you'd expect from business class. I also couldn't get the wifi to work on any flight.

The only negative that I can think of for this flight is that it was much too short. Check-in service at the business class counter was immediate, efficient, and friendly. Qatar uses a multi-airline lounge at HAN which offers mediocre food and spirits but spectacular views of the runway and tarmac. There were very few passengers on the HAN-BKK segment, so boarding did not have to be ""organized"" in any fashion. Despite a very quick turnaround, the plane was clean, neat, and well-prepared. The welcome drink included a choice of two different champagnes. I chose the Billecart-Salon, which was excellent. The snack service was quick and tasty, accompanied by another glass of champagne. The seat back TV screens are huge, with a clear and sharp picture. I entertained myself with the sky-map, but if the flight had been longer, there was a huge selection of movies, TV shows, and music. Departure and arrival were punctual, and Qatar provides a pass to allow J class passengers to use an expedited immigration line at BKK.

The cabin felt great and the entertainment system was excellent with no lag at all with swiping and so on. The camera options were great too. Food was excellent, gin tonic with ice even, wine and cognac and coffee. Downside was the repetitive adverts and the safety video revolving around Barcelona and football which quickly got very annoying. I pre-selected vegetarian meal on both flights but was only served it on the 2nd leg, the normal food being served looked much better to be honest.

All flights full and on time (one had an ignorable delay), service on ground and on plane top notch. Long stay-overs, long time lounge access, and potential immigration issues were sorted out smoothly by Qatar Airways ground staff. First Class DOH-CAI-DOH is de facto just only business class but in widebody. On the outbound they served only breakfast and no meat-dishes were offered. Likewise no fresh garlic, ginger, chilli nor fish-sauce is available. No ice-cream, mango smoothies (only strawberry). But the extensive drink list and the cabin staff service made it somehow up. On Cairo to Doha it was a more fully fledged menu with excellent options. From Cairo pre-departure champagne was not offered due to local laws. Cost cutting edges has also begun to show in Doha, where they stopped a la carte servings in Al Mourjan lounge. However, in the alternative Al Safwa first class lounge they provide even fully fledged free “hotel rooms” inside the lounge. Last leg DOH-CMB was operated by Sri Lankan who also did well (see my other review for the Sri Lankan leg). Qatar Airways takes particularly good care of their elite frequent flyers.

The flight attendants had forgotten that I had requested a vegetarian meal, (fortunately there was a vegetarian option on the regular menu) and they kept waking people up for the meal service even though our flight left Shanghai at midnight. The saving grace was the amenity bag. However, when we boarded our flight to Madrid, it was like two completely different airlines. The Boeing 787 was spacious, and the flight attendants were friendly and the vegetarian options were tasty - the other passengers even asked if they could have what I was having. Our flight back to Shanghai was a marked improvement on the first flight. Even though it was a Boeing 777 again with the 3-4-3 seating, we had a lot more leg room this time around.

The seats assigned seemed to be entirely random, no effort was made to keep us together, preference for window or aisle were largely ignored. My seat gave average legroom and width. The arms of the seat on the Boeing 777LR only go up about 3/4 of the way making it extremely difficult to get out of the row, especially when the seat in front is reclined. If there are empty seats you can't lie down unless you can fit under the partially extended arms. We had a 15+ hour flight from Doha, we departed about 8am from Doha an average breakfast was served at 9am, we received a bag of chips about 5 hours later. They came around with drinks several times and our choice was a juice or water, drinks were served at room temperature no ice was provided. After 8 hours from breakfast they served us a small chicken or vegetarian pasty with a small brownie; a fuller selection of drinks was offered, no ice unless you asked.  After 6 hours with no snacks they offered a dinner. I thought the food service was meager and food quality was average, snacks were nearly non existent. Drink choices during the flight were minimal, the lack of ice was disappointing. I picked Qatar Airways because I read many glowing reviews about extra service and space, but found the flight in economy very average. The entertainment options were very good, but my remote on the trip to Johannesburg did not work properly, on the return trip the remote would not stay in place and hung down on the back of the seat.

The first leg of the flight was on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner in economy. This was a fantastic aircraft and it was very quiet, the food and service and entertainment was spot on from Manchester to Doha and we had the exit row which made it easier for me to stretch my legs. We only had a one hour transfer time at Hamad International Airport. The Airport was huge and it was so modern and clean. We boarded the A380 for our flight to Bangkok, this aircraft is huge and I found the economy seats to be very comfortable with large IFE screens to watch the entertainment to pass the time. Again the service and the food was fantastic and we were in Bangkok in no time. Flying back to Manchester via Doha from Bangkok I asked again for the exit rows in Bangkok and if we could sit upstairs in the small economy section on the A380, this was successful but we did not get the exit row on the A380 but it was nice to be sat in the small economy section upstairs.

I have flown this route 3 times in the last 8 months with 3 different carriers. My favorite is Qatar Airways.  The first noticeable difference is the ease of navigating their website which is well organised and easy to get to the required services. Check-in at Singapore was quick and completed within 15 mins including the time I started queuing in line to get checked-in. The smooth check-in experience was repeated again in JFK with a knowledgeable staff who was professional, friendly and accommodating. Worth mentioning is Qatar Airway's use of Terminal 7 at JFK. It could be sheer luck but on both occasions at arrival and departure, I did not experience the massive crowds that I had experienced in other JFK terminals. The seats are organised in a 3-3-3 configuration and each seat comes with a large touch screen tv with a separate console for controls. The feel and look of the tv is much sleeker than those of the other 2 carriers I have flown and comes with more varied programming. Another well designed feature is the toilets which come with a decent sized wash basin and a wet tissue dispenser for cleaning the toilet seats. Ample food options were available even though I sat close to the back of the plane. There are no overhead cabins for the last 4 to 5 rows of seats in the middle block but there does not seem to be any problems accommodating everyone's bags.

After sitting on the plane for over 1 hr already, were absolutely amazed by the Qatar policy to let people board the plane still 50 minutes after departure time (9.45 am and 10.35), people were simply late and kept other passengers waiting on this Sunday morning - very good weather and no traffic problems in KUL.

Unfortunately, this flight was worse in several areas than the usual quality experience on QR: delayed boarding that was simply unacceptable, tight seating 3-4-3 with good 33"" seat pitch though, mediocre food and small portions and the general feeling of being cramped on board. The mid-flight snacks could be healthier as well: always white bread which is far too sweet, very sweet cakes or crisps - 6/10 only. DOH - TXL on A333 the same Sunday afternoon was another story: excellent boarding with on-time departure from DOH, pleasant and highly motivated cabin crew, three options for lunch (beef-chicken-vegetarian), water and juices served three-four times during the flight and an early arrival at TXL. The meal service was exemplary with two + two carts in economy plus one hostess serving the last five-six rows from the rear galley, which seemed fast & efficient.

The last two times I used Qatar I had the same thought about food, maybe it's all about my own expectations, but it could be better. It just feels average if you compare it with others. Last time snacks were not that good and not really varied (it was also because due to time difference I had breakfast x 2, snaks x2 - felt very repetitive).

"""Qatar staff are tremendous""",9.0,B Charles,2016-07-11,"✅ Verified Review |  We went back to Qatar Airways after a disappointing flight with Emirates recently and were very happy that we did. Whereas Emirates appear to cut corners in business class, Qatar get this all right. The business lounge at Heathrow is exceptional, great staff, facilities and a superb restaurant with waiter-served gourmet food on offer and a good wine/drinks selection. Boarding was quick and close by. The seats on Q002 to Doha and then onto Denpasar, are 2/2/2 config. If you are not a couple, choose a centre seat, or your window 'partner' will have to climb over you for a toilet visit. The centre seats both have direct aisle access. Seats are not super-wide, but are comfortable and recline fully. The one idea Qatar could take from Emirates is the extra padded seat-base provided, just to make lying down a bit softer if you want to properly sleep. TV screens are big, like Emirates, but unlike Emirates, are high quality/pixelated, so no grainy movies on a huge screen which hurt your eyes. Large choice of movies, mini-series, etc. Qatar staff are tremendous, quite the most eager to please off all airlines I've flown in a long time. Food selection is excellent and served as though in a restaurant, heated and then decanted onto china plates, arranged gourmet style with perfectly heated, fresh bread. Onboard Wifi on both airlines is quite useless but that's a developing technology. The transfer in DOH (to the DPS flight), was a very long walk (15 minutes) but no buses at least and we used the time to stretch our legs. Overall, we'd certainly choose Qatar over Emirates again, even if the fares (which vary considerably) are more expensive to fly with Qatar.

"""usual high quality product""",8.0,H Simpson,2016-07-04,"✅ Verified Review |  Flew Qatar Airways from Abu Dhabi to London Heathrow via Doha. Usual high quality product but far from 10/10 perfection, notably departure and arrival into Abu Dhabi. Good points: pristine aircraft and crew, inflight entertainment, excellent timekeeping. As a Silver Privilege card holder I benefit from accessing the upper-deck 'snug' on the A380 at no extra cost. This is at least equivalent to the inflated-price Premium Economy provided by European airlines - excellent. Particularly impressed with Heathrow. On arrival, immigration cleared and bags collected in less than 15 minutes even for a Chinese passport holder. On departure from T4, no queue at check-in - although other airlines appeared to have issues - with ample seating, excellent wifi and refreshment options at High Street prices in the departure lounge, £1 for a Boots' sandwich, a steal. Gripes: in common with other middle east airlines, the continued use of buses at Doha that dump connecting passengers at furthest distance from the departure terminal - minimum 20 minute walk - albeit, for both legs, without a requirement to pass through further security checks(?), continual promotion of complimentary wifi on the aircraft that seldom actually worked and, in any event, is only 'complimentary' for a maximum of 10 minutes during the flight. The inadequacies of AUH are well documented elsewhere. Suffice, with Qatar departures at 0555 and 0645 - the former a B777/A332 - check-in was chaotic with woefully inadequate provision of desks and organization of queues which, fortunately, on this occasion, did not delay departure. This is a daily event so no excuses. On return to AUH, after the interminable taxi to the far end of the airport, thereafter a 30 minute wait for ground services to provide stairs to the obligatory bus and an hour to clear immigration, Accepted airport travails are largely outside the control of the airline. Nonetheless, Qatar surely has the wasta to secure improvement, especially at Doha? AUH may be a lost cause, however. I would lose no sleep were Qatar to switch additional resources to DWC and offer an express coach from Abu Dhabi centres in lieu of serving AUH. Indeed, were the policy pursued I would likely benefit from additional sleep.","A380, A320",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,AUH to LHR via DOH,2016-07-01,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,5,yes,AUH,LHR ,qatar airways

Check-in was handled kindly and smart in CPH, despite I was a bit demanding: I needed to coordinate three check-in’s as I travelled with family members in economy class. Lounge access granted perfectly, even to family. Luggage handled perfectly and arrived on time. All flights on time. This airline is a solid winner and continues to never disappoint me as the product is very predictable. All departures were on time, earlier, or slightly delayed (in two cases). FA onboard in general are among the very best, quickest, devoted, and most kind that I have experienced. For all 8 business class legs predeparture drinks (inc. champagne) was generously offered. This was for CPH, the first time I experienced that pre-departure champagne was being offered in business class.  Food and wines were good throughout but food is getting less, lesser options, smaller portions, often only one meat choice.  I was given amenity kits on all longhaul sectors and pyjamas on night-flights. The bar in A380 worked well though I’d prefer chairs to sofas – and missed some music or a bit of life. The best lounges were in Doha, but also the ones in Bangkok were good. The third party lounge used in CPH Airport, “Aspire”, disappoints in comparison with those offered in DOH, BKK, and HAN.

"""bye, bye, European carriers""",10.0,Nikolaus Rieskamp,2016-06-28,"✅ Verified Review | Frankfurt to Dubai via Doha. Qatar Airways really is in a class of its own when flying Business Class. Aircraft brand-new, seating outstanding (777 in 2-2-2 layout - only weak point is no Wifi), staff naturally friendly, meal service on demand whenever you want it and tasty food. As this might not be enough, you get, as they call the premium class between DOH and DWC ""First Class"", access to the incredible Al Safwa First Lounge in Doha, where you find absolute silence and all the rest you dream of being used to overcrowded european Business Lounges. In Frankfurt, Qatar uses the Air Canada Star Gold Lounge, which is not at all bad, but nothing compared to Doha. Flying to Dubai via DWC was a great decision. This airport is really small, so the distance to walk from the aircraft to the car-parking (free and empty) is about 200m and takes, queue-less immigration and baggage claim inclusive, some 20 minutes. The short 40 min flight DOH-DWC was operated by Al Maha Airways. You get real Business Class recliner seats, pre-departure drink, arabic coffee and a warm tasty meal. For me, Qatar Airways is the better way to fly - for not even 2100€ return.

Our first flight was delayed an hour in LHR, we were quite concerned we would miss our connecting flight only one hour in Doha. Spoke to two cabin crews, they said there was not much they could do. After landing in Doha, there was no boarding gate so it took a while to reach the departure hall by bus, there is an information counter outside where we came in, however staff weren't being helpful apart from telling us we needed to be fast. The ground staff knew there were about 50 passengers on our flight that were late for their connecting flight, without any help on the ground, me and my husband along with 50 passengers had to run from gate D2 to B3, this was 3 kilometers in distance.

"""business class was outstanding""",10.0,Ashley Perera,2016-06-22,"✅ Verified Review |  Colombo to New York via Doha return with Qatar Airways. In short, this was a memorable experience and the service we received in business class was outstanding. Check in Colombo was smooth although the Araliya lounge did not do justice to Qatar Airways service. A340 between Colombo and Doha had angled, lie-flat seats in 2-2-2 configuration. Service was exceptional except the staff initially forgot to serve my wife the meal she requested. The menu offered all day dining with a good selection of food and wine. Although the transfer ticket pouch states to show this on arrival in Doha there was no ground staff to welcome transit passengers. We had to find our way to the Business Class Lounge, which was not far from the gate. The lounge is an experience in itself, like a mini hotel, with two restaurants, drink stations, two buffets, serviced bars, sleep stations with lie flat couches, toilets with attendants, showers, etc. The lounge was inviting but no announcements are made. We were the last go through security but had no issues. We were looking forward to the A350 and to experience this new aircraft. A350 business class seats are in a 1-2-1 configuration with direct aisle access. We had chosen two middle seats to be close to each other. But they were still reasonably apart to provide adequate privacy with a slide-out screen in between the seats. Cabin staff were very welcoming. The amenity kit for this flight really was exceptional with Armani products, noise cancelling headphones and pyjamas. The cabin staff on this flight was exceptional and made you feel valued. The a la carte menu had a wide range of options to choose from any time you like and was complimented by an extensive selection of wines and spirits. The senior flight attendant was helpful setting up my phone for the on-board wi-fi. Equally the flight attendant who was looking after my wife went to the extent of preparing a special vegetarian meal, when she found that what was on the menu did not suit my wife. On arrival in NY, each one came to say goodbye to the passengers which I thought was very graceful. The return flight from NY to Doha was on a B777-200LR, which had lie flat seats in a 2-2-2 configuration. The seats were not as new as the A350 but nevertheless were comfortable and managed to get good few hours of sleep ahead of the day out in Doha. There was no wi-fi on this aircraft. The service was good, but having experienced the service on A350, I felt bit disappointed. On the return we enjoyed the Qatar Airways complimentary city tour and had more time to spend in the Business Class Lounge. We had breakfast and lunch in the restaurant. The food didn’t taste as exceptional as on board. However, there was a good selection in the menu as well as in the buffet.

Food of good quality but in minuscule amounts, limited choice of spirits. Seats were of a nice modern design, generally comfortable, however did not leave much room for shoulders so sitting next to someone of a larger build meant some bodily contact. Layout 3-4-3 did not help much. Also legroom spoke of BA standards (Which is not a compliment). Entertainment had a good amount of options to choose from, but clearly less than Emirates. Not that intutive in use. Flight to Warsaw had paradoxally more a relaxing feeling, better seats, more classic in shape, but no alcohol offered, possibly thanks to Ramadan.

No Business class seats so the leg was in First class. Catering excellent and service on board was second to none! The crew was extremely attentive hat off to the cabin services supervisor and her staff. The Food was superb and the in flight entertainment very good for short haul. The Qatar business lounge at Hamad airport was dry (no alcohol) because it was Ramadan. This for an international traveler transiting through an airport is a big thumbs down for me as I like a glass of wine with my meal. This in future will cause me to chose another airline during this time of year. The second leg was on a Qatar A380. Again excellent service although with 50 plus business class seats the boarding was a bit like economy with a posh seat. Takes a long time to give the personal service I like when boarding. IE welcome drink, towel, pjs and menus etc. The cabin services manager must have seen me frowning and I got everything pretty sharpish after that. The in flight entertainment on this leg kept locking and needed resetting. Also people using their own headsets had damaged the headset jack that resulted in loss of quality of sound in my seat. The food was superb again. I enjoyed being able to walk around and use the the stand up bar and lounge area at the back of the business class section. This is very nice and it stops people gathering in the galley area to get drinks and chat.

Due to light load plenty of rows were empty and pax were able to lie flat if they so wished. A7-BAX was a new aircraft and the new type of seats were found to be much more comfortable than the earlier ones. Flight departure was on schedule and arrived early which gave us a comfortable time-gap to transfer to another flight. For lunch there were 3 options and the ones we ordered were very palatable, snacks were readily available throughout the flight. The transfer service at Doha airport was exceptionally good - we had requested wheel chairs and were provided electric 'buggies' from one end of the terminal [B] to end of terminal C and so onto terminal D as well as being escorted onto the bus and up to the aircraft door - we experienced no hassle at all and  would like to thank Qatar Airways ground staff and Doha airport. The flight from Doha to Islamabad was operated by an A320 A7-ADG a mid-aged aircraft, however the cabin was well maintained and the washrooms were clean - we found this surprising as our experience on this sector has been somewhat different on other airlines. The service by the cabin crew lived upto the 5* image, however we felt a major shortfall in the dinner offered - only one option of poor quality rice and a spicy curry.

Seat was comfortable, screen and earphone quality outstanding and the entertainment selection classy which means a lot of arthouse movies and first rate recordings of operas and classical music available. Toilets were clean and roomy - impressed by the mood-lighting. Instead of the usual cold white lighting: warm and red colours which even made the ""necessary"" a pleasant and entertaining experience. Only disappointment was the food: quality, presentation and quantity were nothing to write home about. I had salad and apple-pie dessert but left the main course untouched. There is room for improvement. However on the plus-side drinks-rounds were frequent.

"""I was left disappointed""",4.0,W Peters,2016-06-07,"✅ Verified Review |  I used to regard Qatar Airways as one of the very best airlines in the world. This was based mostly on my journey taken in 2014 from Warsaw to Hanoi via Doha. I was impressed by the quality and standards QA presented then. This is why this year (after traveling with Emirates in 2015) I decided to fly with Qatar Airways to Sri Lanka from Warsaw. Unfortunately this time I was left disappointed. 1) Changing an aircraft - choosing QA I was tempted with advertisements of a brand new Boeing 787 Dreamliner. I chose the connection offering this very plane, but a few months later it was changed for one of the oldest machines used by QA - Airbus 340. 2) On board service - in 2014 every passenger was given a travel set (earplugs, toothbrush etc), during my last flight (which was overnight) no such thing was available. 3) Meals - in 2014 there were two meals served (main dish and a snack) now it's only one. 4) No snacks were available during my QR664 flight (unlike in 2014) 5) Drinks - QR boast about being the one air company offering champagne in economy class. No such thing was available, neither on my first flight from Warsaw to Doha this year, nor during flight from Doha to Colombo. These are not very big problems, but they have left me thinking it was only two years, so many changes and all of them for the worse.

Flights between Melbourne and Doha were aboard a B777-300ER. A comfortable plane for long haul flights. Good leg room (and I'm a big guy). Entertainment system was good - plenty of new and old movies to choose from as well as other entertainment. As good as any I've seen (including Emirates). The food was mixed. Return flights were better than outbound and breakfast seemed to be the least favorite. But some great tasting dinners were served for economy class. Service was generally good, but better on return flights. Overall, relaxed, friendly and efficient. Doha airport was a pain due to the transit security screening (which seems pointless), but the airport itself was good. Strangely, I'd like to recommend the Burger King there. Generally found that the Boeing planes were more comfortable than Airbus. Cushioning and leg room were much better on the former.

Boeing 777-300er with the new seat layout 3x4x3 was a nightmare from Denpasar to Doha. Boeing 787 DOH-CPH was not much better. The food was nothing to write home about with very small portions.

The space in 787 in economy class is disastrous: the distance from nose-tip to screen of monitor is hardly 20 cm when the seat in front is declined.

"""disregard for Platinum members",7.0,M la Prairie,2016-05-07,"✅ Verified Review |  Philadelphia to Doha, and more complete disregard for Privilege Club Platinum members. Originated travel with American Airlines in Washington, ending in Kuwait with Qatar Airways via DOH. Bad weather in PHL led to a ground stop in DCA, delaying departure by about 45 minutes. I eventually arrived in PHL with a full hour before departure of QR728 to DOH. I was concerned about my one piece of checked luggage making the connection from AA to QR in PHL. I was assured at the gate that all luggage had been loaded. Then the gate supervisor boarded the aircraft to inform me that my luggage had not, in fact, been transferred from AA to QR. I thought of deplaning, but as assured that it would be put on another QR flight that evening from JFK, BOS, MIA, IAD or ORD. PHL is only one of two QR flights from the US that departs in the morning. QR had a good 10 hours to figure out how to get my bag to another US departure city for a QR flight to DOH that evening. On arrival in DOH, no one was there to greet me on disembarkation to provide me any information, despite being a platinum member of Privilege Club and a very frequent flyer with a lucrative corporate account. At the first class lounge in DOH prior to my onward flight to KWI, I asked about my bag. The system showed no information. The agent at the reception said she’d phone around to find out where it is. A few minutes later, she located me in the lounge to inform me that my bag was still sitting in PHL and would travel tomorrow on QR728, a full 24 hours later. QR had ample time to get my bag to another US city for a departure on a QR flight to DOH that same evening. I am annoyed and feel that Qatar Airways did not handle this properly and risks losing their high yield customers if this is how they manage things. To add insult to injury, from the first class lounge to gate D1 for the KWI flight is a long walk and one would think that there would be buggies available at the exit from the first class lounge to transport first class passengers to remote gates. Despite assurances in DOH that someone would greet me on arrival in KWI, of course, there was no one there.

The aircraft started moving from the stand and they were all still standing and talking, and the attendant did not say a word to them, even though they were right next to them.  Qatar Airways need to overhaul the control and the content of their entertainment system, it is annoying for being extra sensitive and films were old. It is a global airline and most of us do not mind watching a kiss.  Food was sensational and service impeccable, apart from the FA in the lounge who could not care less.

But when things go wrong they go very wrong. Recent trip DXB to SYD, we missed our connection in Doha as we were late to the gate and got lost changing gates. We were informed we would need to pay a very large sum of money to move to the next flight although we are premium and the class ticket was the exact same. It was this or cancel the holiday and pay for a flight back to Dubai until then they refused to release our bags - we paid the large amount and paid for hotels.

Didn't make any time up in the air, and on landing at Doha it meant half the plane missed our connections, including me, which meant being stranded in Qatar for a night. Qatar Airways insisted I stay in the airline-owned hotel a shuttle bus ride away from the airport, despite my request to stay in the airport hotel. I got no sleep due to the noise and 4am wake up call, and they charged me USD$21 for an hour of Internet access. Missed my morning of meetings in Oman due to the rescheduled flight. The shocking thing is that on return no one cared an ounce about the fact their decision to hold the plane in London - not weather or mechanical. I asked for compensation for the $21 I had to spend on their hotel's Internet and was refused. True customer service shows through when things go badly and Qatar failed in this case.

"""avoid the Boeing 787""",7.0,Dennis Feenstra,2016-03-29,"Amsterdam to Bangkok via Doha with Qatar Airways. Amsterdam - Doha leg was the Boeing 787-800. Fortunatly the ground staff at Amsterdam Airport assigned me to an exit row seat, which gave me more legroom. This worked out well for me, since the normal seats on the B787 are too small and only have 31 inch pitch.  Avoid the Boeing 787 at all costs. On arrival in Doha we were transported by busses to the terminal and welcomed by a long queue for a security check. It took quite some time as they had only 2 or 3 stations open, with several international flights arriving at the same time. With the new departure time from Amsterdam (18.15 instead of 14.40) you may have only minutes to transfer (depending where you're flying next of course) and that might turn out to be too short. Hamad Airport wasn't quite what I had hoped for. One positive note; Doha is not as busy as Dubai. Doha to Bangkok was on the fantastic A380. This flight was very good and I was lucky again and given a seat on the upper deck economy section (seat 25b). The seat was in front of the bulkhead and offered me extra legroom ones again. Smooth flight (or rather a nice inflight sleep). The return flight from Bangkok to Doha was an A380 again and was uneventfull. At Suvarnabhumi it took the ground staff quite some time to realise that their check at boarding wasn't going to work with only 1 staff member checking passports and boarding cards. After some time another staff member came and checks went quicker and the flight could depart on time. On arrival in Doha no security check, off the airplane into the terminal. The flight from Doha to Amsterdam was now on a new Boeing 777 with 10 seat abreast. Still not bad and I was happy I didn't have to sit on that awful 787. Nice flight and another fine crew. On all flights the crew was nice, and they worked hard, always smiling, always happy to help.  Transfer time in Doha only 50 minutes, which is a recipe for disaster and that is a dealbreaker for me.

The Barramundi in Saffron sauce I was served on the way back from Melbourne, was something I would be very happy with at a high end restaurant! There biggest asset is their staff who provide consistent and warm hospitality. I was greeted by name on boarding on several flights, including with 'salaam' which was a nice touch.

The snack is cleared but there was still 1.5 hours of the flight remaining - this second service could take place a little later into the flight. Cabin staff should bring a tray of drinks around occasionally but on my flight having a chat in the galley seemed to take priority. If laptops should be turned off during landing / take off the staff should enforce this rule, not just leave it as they do the cabin check. Blankets and headsets should be collected before landing in my opinion.

The space on both the A380 and Boeing 787 was almost identical and very comfortable. My only gripe is that on the morning flight from Doha to Edinburgh we were hungry and had breakfast shortly after take off on a 7.5 hour flight. By 5 hours into the flight all we had been offered was drinks, tea and coffee. After mentioning I was peckish, I was given a packet of chocolate cookies. About an hour out of Edinburgh, the cabin crew discreetly asked the few passengers who looked hungry if they wanted a snack and brought out some bits and pieces (I had ravioli and someone else a cheeseboard). I got the feeling this was leftovers rather than an actual snack service since they kept running out of dishes and not everyone received something.

Qatar Airways offer Dine on demand for premium cabin passengers. As this was a late night flight only light meals and breakfast were served but they were reasonably nice. Transfer at Doha was seamless and the lounge was huge and airy, quite crowded but had quiet corners to rest alone. The second leg departing Doha was not as good as the first leg. Boarding chaotic, service was still fair but cabin crew seemed robotic and a little disinterested.  I ordered lamb as main and it was a little overcooked. Arrived Montreal on time.

AVOD fine with the greatest choice available on the A350, including a tail mounted camera which gives an amazing perspective of flying at high altitude.

We are Oneworld Ruby card holders so from the time of booking got access to reserving seats which was great. Our first flight was on the A380 so we got seats reserved in the small cabin at the back of the upper deck (only 7 or 8 rows). When we checked our bags we were able to use Business class check in (Oneworld benefit was honoured! However the seats we had chosen months ago were changed when we tried online check in and I could not change them. Frustrating that the agent at the desk could not change this back and we were referred to another desk to the flight supervisor who to be fair despite arguing with me about ""accepting"" those seats when I checked in online, did change them to our original preference. I was grateful for this and thanked her. Onboard the seat on the A380 is really good. Thin seat, but comfortable and plenty of personal space including legroom. The recline is very good, but thankfully for me no one in front other wise it would have been in my face. There's a decent sized IFE screen and a reasonable choice of movies. Despite this cabin only being half full it took about 90 mins before we were offered any service which was lunch. Nice enough, but the entree portion was small, and drinks were offered with the meal almost like an afterthought. Throughout the flight the crew were friendly and responsive if you asked for more drinks, but not proactive. Close to arrival we were served a wrap and muffin which were nice. Transferring at Hamad international was a breeze, you literally walk through a supervised glass door straight back into the departure lounge (it is different on your return). Really nice modern and relatively quiet airport at 7pm local time. For westerners there is nice French themed bar and restaurant that serves alcohol in the departure lounge. The second leg to Abu Dhabi was less than an hour in duration. The seat comfort was fine on the Boeing 777-300 and it had IFE if you wanted it. The crew served a savoury pastry and cake with a cuplet of orange juice.  Overall the experience felt good value for money, albeit I wasn't bowled over given the 5 star experience I was expecting.

A330 is a nice aircraft, small business class section with comfortable seats, decent selection of movies, food very good as usual on Qatar.

We were delayed 2 hours because a passenger onboard wasn't feeling well as the plane was taxiing out. Instead of offloading this passenger, the captain decided to wait for a doctor to treat them. The passenger was found to be fit to travel and we departed 2 hours late. This meant we missed our connecting flight at Doha for the onward leg to the Maldives. What made us angry was that our connecting flight was still on the ground at Doha when we landed, but couldn't be held for a short time to allow connecting passengers to board. On arrival we were presented with transfer and hotel vouchers as we disembarked at Doha at 7.30am. We were not allowed to retrieve luggage and were taken by minibus to a hotel on the outskirts of Doha (the Golden Ocean), which seemed like a 2 star hotel. We tried to sleep but this proved impossible as the hotel is situated next to a building site - there was constant drilling and hammering all day long.  Not having access to any of our luggage compounded the misery, as we couldn't change into clean clothes. We were collected at 10pm for the flight to the Maldives which departed at 1am. No member of staff apologised at any time - we felt abandoned. We missed 2 nights sleep in a row and arrived at our holiday destination shattered.

Eating on demand is a good idea. Too many annoying PA's promoting Qatar as tourist destination, too many commercials/charity commercials made the IFE irritating.

The plane was fairly clean, pillows and blankets are comfortable. The seats have a small, flexible reading light. I don't remember if they have plugs for your phone/computer, but I think they do. All in all, it was very comfortable for a semi-long flight - it is only a little over 6 hours.

A320 on a 4.5 hour night flight with non flat seats does not make for a comfortable sleep zone. So this was a negative.

On arrival in Doha, everything improved. There was a separate waiting area to board the plane to Paris, my flight attendant was amazingly attentive and detail oriented - putting away my carry-on for me, explaining the menu and the seat, and asking me when I wanted to dine, and introducing herself to me by name. When I had my pre-landing meal, another flight attendant observed that I enjoyed my smoothie, and offered me another one, even though he wasn't my assigned flight attendant.

Qatar Airways customer review,9.0,R Zahid,2015-08-05,"Edinburgh Airport is a bit of a joke at present. Massive queues breaching out of the entrance with staff not having a clue who is coming and going. The security queues are worse and a bigger joke (being business class I avoided them through FastTrack). Once making my way to the Qatar counter, it was fantastic from there onwards. Check-in of our luggage was smooth, the aircraft departed on time. Seats in the Boeing 787 are at a funny angle but very comfortable and true lie-flat. Meals were well presented and not stodgy. IFE was excellent, perhaps not as good as Emirates. The cabin crew were excellent with attention to detail and sometimes a bit too nice. The Doha business lounge is very good. Not busy and a decent selection of food (although some of it was pretty lukewarm). Boarding onwards to the Singapore flight (again the Boeing 787) was seamless and the FA were again fantastic and dished out pyjamas to sleep in. On arrival, we literally were out within 10 minutes and had our suitcases with a further 10 minutes.

For such a short flight, the seats were fantastic! 180 degree flat bed seats, and very comfortable in an upright position as well. After a smooth takeoff, meals were served. Good breakfast however a family member of mine was informed that they had run out of the breakfast meal she wanted. This was quite disappointing as there were only 6 people in business class and Qatar cannot be known for great food if they run short of them. Other than this, the entertainment system was one of the best, the lighting in the aircraft gave the environment a very comfortable feel and the service was excellent.

The A330-200 from Clark to Doha had the new business class seats, fully flat unlike the outward journey. The food was excellent again. Has Qatar changed its chefs in the last two weeks.

Qatar Airways customer review,10.0,Brian McCaig,2015-07-13,"A few years ago, I took advantage of a special offer from London with Qatar Airways in economy class, and was impressed with the standards of service then. Now that they fly from Edinburgh, I decided to give them another try, and I wasn't disappointed. From the minute we arrived at check-in, we were made to feel welcome. Similarly at boarding, the staff were attentive and wishing people a pleasant flight. On board the Dreamliner, the business cabin is superb. Each lie-flat seat is positioned so that it's like a little personal oasis, and is comfortable, fully adjustable, and with lots of little cubby-holes for your bits and pieces. You're also supplied with rather good noise-cancelling headphones, and an Armani amenity kit. These are waiting for you when you arrive, and they have different packs for male and female passengers. Pre take-off drinks are also served. The service on-board is impeccable - there's one flight attendant for four passengers, and the food is excellent. The menu is extensive and you can choose any items, as and when you please. The plane itself was smooth and quiet, and the attendants ensured that the toilets were always clean and well stocked. Despite a short 45 minute connection time, I was impressed by the new Hamad International airport, where we were whisked through security for our ongoing connection. I would thoroughly recommend Qatar Airways and it will be my airline of choice for future trips, even though Glasgow airport is more convenient for me.",Boeing 787,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Edinburgh to Hong Kong via Doha,2015-07-01,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5,yes,Edinburgh,Hong Kong ,qatar airways
Qatar Airways customer review,8.0,R Gonzaga,2015-07-13,"Good flight on first leg. Used the BA lounge in PHL which is underwhelming. Quick boarding and attendant was pleasant and proactive in our cabin. Served a chilled drink and towel and orders taken for lunch. They emphasise the fact that the meals are a la carte which means you can choose when you want to eat. The food was well presented visually but lacked flavour and I had to send back an over cooked chicken dish. There is a good wine selection. The seats on the 772 are spacious and are laid out in a 2-2-2 fashion. IFE was just okay, nothing special. They supply you with pyjamas, slippers, amenity kits and a thin 'mattress', duvet and pillow. I can't fault the service but the planes need a remodel in terms of the seat and configuration. The downside is the washrooms which in my opinion are no different from J class washrooms. The next sector was on an A332. Terrible seats, limited storage areas and no USB port! Again food was well presented but underwhelming in terms of what you pay for. All planes left on time. I would recommend this airline if the price is good for a C class cabin but interiors need upgrading.","Boeing 772LR, A332",Family Leisure,Business Class,PHL to KUL via DOH,2015-07-01,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4,yes,PHL,KUL ,qatar airways

We had a delay out of Philly due to rain, and with a short layover in Doha, we did not know if we'd make our connecting flight. Immigration was super fast, and they held the plane for us, though we literally got to the gate with 0 seconds to spare.

Qatar Airways customer review,5.0,John Duffus,2015-07-09,"After near perfect flights on the outward sectors to the UK, QR slipped up on the return. Having decided which movie to watch after lunch, not one of the new movies had been loaded onto the 787's IFE system - even 8 days after the start of the month. I then looked at the classical selection of the music channels. These are distinctly second rate in terms of choice - and not all are classical. IFE is one area where QR can definitely improve. Prior to take off on the second flight from Doha to BKK the FA asked about meal choices, reminding me the meal would served on demand as is QR's custom. I made it very clear I wished to sleep as long as possible on the 6 hour flight requesting merely orange juice, coffee and a croissant just prior to descent. We agreed this would be served one hour prior to landing. I was then awakened, raised my chair, threw my eye mask and ear plugs into the side bin as my orange juice was served only to realise there were in fact 2 hours of the flight remaining. The first comment was ""we are arriving early!"" which was not true. The second was that it was assumed I would need time to freshen up! Both inexcusable! On going to the aft toilet to change, the basin was clogged with filthy water and unusable. Then on asking for the complex landing cards required in Bangkok, I was informed they had not been loaded at Doha since they had had no stock for a week. Yet with 4 daily flights to/from BKK, surely the world's best airline could figure out a way to get a stack of them back to Doha!",Boeing 787 / A380,Solo Leisure,Business Class,EDI to BKK via Doha,2015-07-01,4.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,4,yes,EDI,BKK ,qatar airways

Qatar Airways customer review,10.0,Rob Bowden,2015-07-06,"This was my return leg to Brussels via Doha on Qatar business class. The first leg was on their 777-300 which after flying out on the 787 and A380 could not be as good, how wrong. The cabin is very spacious and like First class on other airlines. The seat arrangement is 2-2-2 with massive seats, about a metre of leg room/standing space and wide aisles. The seats are much more comfortable, especially in lie-flat than the new seats on the 787, A380 proving that older can be better. The service was excellent and all the staff new our names. There's a free Armani gift for male and female which are placed on the right seats before boarding, a nice touch. The food and drink options are not too impressive but I was quick to order as they ran out of some choices on our outbound flights. The second leg was on the new 787 Dreamliner. The seat arrangement is 1-2-1 but there's not as much room as on the 777 and not as comfortable as I discovered when I tried to sleep, this was an overnight leg. They provide a very thin mattress, a very comfy pillow and a nice blanket if you want to sleep, plus eye cover and earplugs are in your Armani gift set. I skipped the main meal as I'd just eaten in the lounge but I had the breakfast which was nice, with real cappuccino and fresh orange juice.

Doha is a joy for transit passengers who do not have to bother with yet another security check. Lounge is huge with extensive facilities. The second flight was my first on a 787 and I was surprised - I found the experience less enjoyable that the 777. The herring-bone flat bed seat 1-2-1 layout seemed more cramped and I found no advantage in all the hyped up Dreamliner benefits. Still I slept much of the way. Arrived on time!

Qatar Airways customer review,8.0,Rob Bowden,2015-07-06,"I recently flew to Bangkok from Brussels via Doha with Qatar in Business class. The main reason was price as they had a genuine buy one get one free companion sale and it was only £925 each when it was over £1800 from London. Check in was good but they share the British Airways Lounge, I've seen a lot of 1 out of 10's for British Airways on this site so enough said. The first leg was on the Qatar Airways 787 Dreamliner, the seat arrangement is 1-2-1 with only 5 rows so quite exclusive. The seats are cocoon, lie-flat bed style, fully remote controlled, with a big TV, desk, pull-out table, pillow etc and a nice welcome pack of eye cover, ear plugs, lip balm and some nice Armani products. The staff are excellent as to be expected from Qatar Airways but the menu and drinks options were not too impressive. However my wife enjoyed the pink champagne and I enjoyed their signature lime and mint juice pre-flight drinks. The inflight drinks options were limited unless you like wine, lots of wine choice. They don't carry enough of each meal so my wife and I did not get our first choice as we were sat in the back row of 5 they'd ran out! The second leg was on their brand new A380 with business class on the top deck. The seats and arrangement is the same as the 787 just more rows. The icing on the cake and by far the best selling point is the bar. The hostess on bar duty was lovely and made everyone welcome. There was a good choice of drinks and bar snacks, especially the individual carrot cakes. You get a fast pass before landing to avoid the hour long queue at passport control but no free chauffeur service, come on Qatar. Your bags get priority so they're on the carousel before you get there.

Very limited legroom, making the flight really uncomfortable when the flight is full as was the case on the BCN-DOH leg. I am a regular flyer and have found the legroom on all four flights to be exceptionally limited compared to other airlines. Serving of meals on the first two legs seemed disorganized. I was served my meal only two hours after the meal service started. On the second leg I received my meal relatively quickly, but the passengers sitting five rows ahead of me were only served about an hour later. I could not figure out the logic.

The food and drinks on the flights were excellent, the crew could not do enough for me. I only had a very brief visit to their lounge in Doha, but what I saw was very good, my only gripe was that they used buses to and from the planes on both flights in Doha. Qatar Airways London assured that airbridges would be used, especially as they now had a brand new airport, so it looks as if they haven't been informed about them still using buses or they don't want to tell you. As I am 82 years old I find it difficult walking up and down those stairs carrying two cases. Hopefully on my return flight in September, they will use airbridges , I'll have to wait and see.

Qatar Airways customer review,8.0,G Thompson,2015-07-01,"Was curious to try Qatar, having flown Emirates numerous times between S Africa and Europe. Qatar's pricing is a major draw-card, they were significantly cheaper than Emirates. The trip out of JNB to DOH was great, the plane was not full and a lot of passengers had spare seats around them. Not sure that it would have been as pleasant with a full plane. Having heard so much about the Boeing 787, I was expecting it to be state-of-the-art flying, but I can't say that was the case. The seats are as hard  and very cramped - these seats rate very poorly against the Boeing 777, and the only way I could grab any sleep was by sleeping against the window. The food was really good, and I love the containers they use - much better than any other airline I have flown with recently. Entertainment is great - the range is not quite as extensive as Emirates or BA, but streets ahead of Turkish Airlines. One gripe is that the crew would only serve one drink with dinner, I couldn't have a pre-dinner drink and a glass of wine. Thought that was rather mean. The flight between Doha and Istanbul was also good, despite it being a full flight on a narrow body aircraft. Return flight was great too, my only gripe is that every leg of the journey entailed a bus to get to the terminal building, and another back out. That would be okay if you weren't left in the 38 degree heat.

From and to AMS is with the Dreamliner. The flight to and from BKK with the Boeing 777-300ER. Qatar Airways provides a good service in economy, all flights were on time and the transit at the new Doha airport was painless. They have to work on their inflight entertainment system though, as it is a rather clumsy and unresponsive design. That was really the only issue, for the rest inflight service was good.

A drink not long after departure, drink with the meal and a post dinner drink (including good quality Armagnac) plus drinks on request. Champagne was offered in economy - not the most common offering and a welcome change from other airlines who often only offer red/white wine and beer for economy passengers. Comfortable seats with a good range of English, International, Arabic programmes meant the flight was more than tolerable.

Transiting Doha is now much better with the new terminal. And even better if you have a silver card as you get access to a lounge in Entebbe and Doha.

The first thing to do is relocate the Media box away from the under seat area. Having my one foot out in the isle was not only a safety hazard but not fun to be kicked and bumped into because I could not move my feet if placed under the seat. I was sitting next to a larger man who encroached into my seat space. I believe the seat is about 17"" across. Seat pitch minimal but no different to other airlines.

Qatar Airways customer review,10.0,Anders Pedersen,2015-06-16,"Flew 5 June and back from CPH on 13 June routing HAN-BKK-DOH-CPH-DOH-BKK. HAN-BKK in B777-200. BKK-DOH in A380. DOH-CPH in B787. Excellent experience throughout. All flights on time. Staff alert, attentive and productive. Service and drinks world top class. Food amount and quality is significantly slipping but still acceptable. Because QR has recently done a lot of promotional sales, business class cabins are now full or almost full. However, service was still exhibited well and focused. I rate the B777-200 business class seat and cabin comfort high. However, the best seat and cabin among the 3 aircrafts tried was the A380: almost noiseless and with the luxury bar on the upper deck. FA tend not to chat with each other and keep themselves busy making a true effort comforting the pax – they are friendly and talk positively with most passengers. That’s the way! Of all sectors above only the DOH-CPH was in economy, of course a different ballgame with a slimmer hardware and software - but altogether the rating became equally high. Worst on the 787 is the extreme compacted seating which must be among the heaviest packed economy in the world – not much dreaming on that part of the Dreamliner, now I understand the nickname “Nightmare-liner”: If the person in front of you reclines you are forced to do the same unless you close your tray-table! In contrast, the following sector back from CPH-DOH was in the Dreamliner aircraft’s business class which offered a superb odysse, but still a bit below that of QR’s A380. Business class full but staff managed very well, high degree of attention and service. Al Mourjan lounge in DOH clearly 5 star, though too big to my taste. Lots of food in either buffets, a la carte. The bar on 1st floor offered 3 different, prestigious champagnes (I just checked and saw the bottles). From DOH-BKK in A380: faultless, quiet, lots of service and talkative FA’s. I could have all 3 options of hot meals, but limited myself to vegetarian and chicken. Quality of food deteriorates a bit. Slept well. Ground-staff assisted me catching my next flight on a difficult time-constrained connection by a Low Cost Carrier, though actually not QR’s problem.

"""reduce both the level and quality of service""",1.0,Clare Barnaby-Smith,2021-10-17,"✅ Trip Verified |  I fear for the future of airline travel when airlines appear to use the excuse of covid19 to reduce both the level and quality of service, especially for an airline previously renowned for its 1st class operation like Singapore Airlines. I was bitterly disappointed in my recent flying experience with them; from poor quality food to reduced service levels. The crew was still wonderful, but that can't make up for the overall feeling I was left with. Forget your business class comfort pack (in my view, covid19 is not a reasonable excuse for why this has been dropped), you now need to take your own eye patches/earplugs to be able to sleep if you are prone to light/sound. Instead, you'll receive a covid19 kit so you can clean your own cabin area. Meals were of such poor quality that I wished I had brought my own sandwiches. No menus are available so you have to try and listen to rather badly-pronounced meal choices to make your selection. I chose chicken and rice which turned out to be bland and gristly, with practically uncooked chicken skin (see photos). Apparently, the different meal choice of the passenger to my left did not go down well as they also left theirs untouched. My breakfast choice; scrambled eggs and sausage were served practically cold. Excessive amounts of plastic being used in meal preparation is also very disappointing in a world trying on the whole to reduce plastic. This is hands-down the worst experience in business class that I have ever experienced and was compounded by the overly-officious ground staff yelling at us (in hazmat-like suits) to walk in single file as we were marched to a 'holding area' rather than a business class lounge. In this holding area, not even water was on offer. Other lines of passengers transiting on different flights were ordered to stand against the wall whilst our group passed by. My very strong advice, whilst covid19 continues to plague travel, is don't transit through Singapore or use Singapore Airlines.

No menus handed out, no Book the Cook online order of meals offered. The meals on offer were basically Economy meals served on China instead of plastic. The flight attendant was not able to tell me what types of wine were available. She even tried to convince me that a Chablis is a red wine. Everything was served on one tray. All those service shortcomings were explained as ""hygienic precautions"". The seat is very wide, but it’s hard to find a comfy seating position, and padding was insufficient. What really made me upset was the all nigh chit-chatting of the staff in the pantry. I know it was a long empty night flight, but please do not rob me of my sleep. This was not the first time I’ve experienced this on SQ. Transfer in Changi was chaotic, with passengers of each connecting flight being herded in long lines (nobody cared about social distancing here) before being escorted to their next flight. I’ve been on a long haul Qatar Airways flight a couple of weeks ago, and there was no compromise in services, and the staff was disciplined as always during the night flight.

The IFE was good - a varied selection of movies and TV shows, and the screen was large and high quality. Meals were all good - in particular the fried carrot cake was one of the best economy class meals I've eaten! My only gripe would be that there was no alcohol service beyond what came with the meals: usually they would do a drinks run before meals, and then offer top-ups during the meal service. This time the only drinks were offered with the meal. I suspect this may be due to Covid-19, in order to minimise interaction: it wasn't a problem, as crew were always responsive to my requests.

The flight was good, the entertainment system excellent. The crew came round often with water and fruit juice, and a second meal was served before arrival.

At their website we were told one can pre-book meals called 'book the cook' which was a joke, no none of the cabin crew knew anything about it. We were given a very generic meal which was nothing to rave about. I complained to the crew and they promised I would have my choice on the return flight - that did not happen either. Their website also bragged about free wifi at cruising altitude, I was able to connect for 10 mins ,after which there was no way to connect for free. Same thing happened when I logged -in under my wife's name - the cabin crew was helpless and could not help. I was told to pay to get wifi , which of-course I did not. The cabin crew were fantastic and did their best to make us feel happy but there was only so much they could do. I travelled frequently on Singapore airline about 10 yrs ago and then I switched to another airline through Hong Kong , regrettably I could not book with them due to the Corona scare in China. My seat on the A350 could not be reclined 180 degrees and my feet hit the front seat and I had to curve my body to fit the space. There was a bed of course -the flight attendant had to lower the vertical back section and fold it down to make a bed, but the hardness and the need to curve the spine made it hard to sleep on this 18 hrs from LAX and 15hrs to LAX.

"""superior customer service""",9.0,Stephen Clarke,2020-02-20,"Not Verified |  Manila to London via Singapore. The usual Singapore airlines efficient boarding process using boarding groups on both flights. The seats on the 777 are more comfortable than those on the (refitted) A380. A pity because seat comfort is a priority on a thirteen and a half hour flight. To be honest, the old A380 seats were more comfortable than the new but the new look better. Wonderful attentive service from the FAs on both flights. The food served was good on both flights, in fact the ""supper"" (chicken thigh, mashed potato and steamed veg with gravy) on the A380 was exceptionally good for economy class. Sadly the breakfasts remain poor. They continue to serve these awful chicken sausages instead of a decent pork sausage (the ONLY thing BA does better than SQ) and the eggs are failures; either a rubbery omelette or scrambled egg that is sloppy and lacks flavour. I did notice some cost saving measures that I had not previously seen on SQ. No amenity kits, which I did not miss but no longer serving sachets of salt and pepper with the meals is a mistake. Airline meals generally lack flavour so I did miss the black pepper. There was also a smaller selection of snacks in the galley. In my view, they still beat the competition, mainly down to their superior customer service so I will continue to use them.

But the arm rest gap was a bit narrow. The configuration was 3x3x3 and i sat on the middle and two other passengers sat on my right and left side. It was quite okay at the first place, then the meal time came up. I struggled not to spill other's passengers meal with my elbow because it was narrow. The entertainment system was really new. It had a lot of different options there and it was up to date. It was 5 hours 25 minutes flight. We just had one time meal and one snack time. It was okay tho. There were 2 options such as Korean or Western menus. I opted Korean one with the menu of Bibimbap. It was just okay since bibimbap was only vegetable and beef mixed with Korean condiments and.

Odd thing cabin crew never heard of it and 3 days later from SIN-MUC there were no issues with it being taken as hand luggage. Flight boarded late due to a late arrival but some of the time was made up with a near on time arrival. The 787 has a tighter configuration than the A350 regional configuration. This means less seat width and what I perceived as a little less leg room. Plane was spotless. Given the choice I would take the A350 over the 787 as it has it beat in all areas.

I argued with them that they destroyed the luggage so why should my insurance pay for their damaged caused, also the 500HKD would never cover a new suitcase (bought a year ago) so I asked to see somebody from Singapore airlines .. a girl appeared and immediately the same offer was made but the amount got up to 800HKD .. I argued that the money wouldn't even cover a new one. So she agreed to have my luggage picked up from my place in Hkg and tried to have it repaired.

"""lack of crew dedicated to premium economy is an issue""",8.0,Ken Howie,2019-12-12,"Not Verified |  Johannesburg to Singapore in premium economy on the late flight. The incoming flight was delayed as the preceding flight was late departing the gate, and only arrived at the time boarding was supposed to start. However following a very quick turnaround and very efficiently organised boarding, the flight departed on time. There was the usual warm welcome from the crew, who were very active helping passengers stow belongings and settle in. Singapore Airlines do not offer pre-departure drinks, unlike most airlines in premium economy. The seat is comfortable, with good legroom and recline. The calf rest serves little purpose, and is difficult to retract when deployed, which is usually by accident. It was noted that very few passengers used the calf rest. The cabin overall is very pleasant. Service commenced promptly after take off. There was no separate drinks run, which is understandable with a late departure. The meal can best be described as typical airline food, the best part being the ice cream. Service and food is strictly economy class, no crockery nor tablecloth, and from Johannesburg no opportunity to book the cook. Drinks are served in plastic tumblers, with a somewhat meagre offering. A good champagne is offered in premium economy, but in a plastic faux stemmed glass that is even smaller than the standard tumbler. No refills are offered until the trays are cleared somewhat later. Both my wife and I were able to sleep for several hours, and it seemed quite strange to be woken up from a deep sleep to be offered lunch. This was about two hours before landing, which was ahead of schedule. De-planing was quick, and immigration and luggage collection super efficient, as is the norm at Changi.

And the overhead screens showed Group 4 non-stop whilst they boarded other groups, whatever. Service on board was warm and welcoming, food was good but, surprisingly, even though it was announced, no immigration cards were handed out. When I asked, I was told they didn’t have any. I think they just ran out of time. Love flying on the A380, spacious, calm and quiet, it’s a great experience. Got into Changi a few minutes early. Next day afternoon take off for FRA on 777. Food was sparse and mediocre but not bad. Just not quite the same standard and amounts as last year. The entertainment system has a big screen but the amount on offer is nowhere near Emirates standard and it is harder to find things/operate and the touchscreen is sometimes not as responsive as one would have liked. Crew again, very good and friendly. Lots of snacks available incl very fresh apples during meal times, the wines from Chile were excellent and the crew was always walking around with drink trays. A disappointing cost cutting measure on both flights was that they don’t hand out amenity kits anymore, unless you ask cabin crew for them.

Prem Economy cabin was nice and clean, nice orange/grey color scheme. Blanket and pillow on seat, along with with noise cancelling headphones. Amenity kit upon request containing socks, dental kit. Eyemask upon request. Nice pitch, calf support and generous recline for Economy. Meals were on the smaller side, only difference with the back I believe is an extra choice and champagne on plastic cups. Was able to prebook meal using Book the Cook which is a nice feature for Premium Economy. JFK-FRA cabin crew much friendlier than FRA-SIN, but still the trademark SQ service throughout. Krisworld has a great selection of movies and TV- the add playlist is pretty nifty and easy to use. Transfer at FRA was 90min, no fuss, no security. Arrival in SQ was easy and quick. Check in on return flight was great, T3 of Changi is very nice. Return flight was non-eventful. Excellent service particularly on FRA-JFK sector (less full) whereas out of SIN was packed.

The flight attendants don't pay attention to details. They say they will wash baby bottles, but they hand back the bottle with milk still in it. So I had to request to wash the bottles myself (thankfully they allowed this). We ordered the ""Book the Cook"" meals, but the flight attendant didn't look up our info so they tried to serve us regular meals. When I told them we ordered ""Book the Cook"" meals they asked us what we ordered. I couldn't remember. Between the two of us that's 8 meals on 2 different flights that I booked in advance. If I knew I had to bring confirmation of the meal request, I would have done that.  They heated up my daughter's meal without asking so it had to be thrown away because it needs to be consumed within one hour and she was sleeping because the flight was a night flight. The seats are uncomfortable for a 16 hour flight. I feel that economy plus seats for a long-haul flight should recline more. Also, the seats were really difficult for me to recline. When we boarded the plane, there was no bottled water in the water holders. Overall, it was just underwhelming. The price wasn't too bad considering it was Economy Plus and a non-stop flight to LA.

Brisbane to Singapore on the late night flight. Boarding was on time and proceeded smoothly, with the usual warm welcome from the cabin crew. The seating and space is good, as expected in premium economy, with ample locker space. The seats include a leg support which is ineffective, and the footrest is not very good. There are no pre-flight drinks, unlike other airlines premium economy, and the water bottles had not been put out into the holders. This seems to be a hit and miss affair, sometimes the bottles in place on boarding, and other times only handed out later. Having water available immediately at least compensates to some degree for the lack of pre-take off drinks. Drinks were served with the meal shortly after take off, and again the Singapore attitude to premium economy is apparent. Food is the same as economy served on plastic trays, with no linen or crockery. Drinks are served in plastic tumblers. SQ advertise champagne available throughout the flight, and serve a good quality champagne, but in a tiny plastic tumbler. Service starts in premium economy, but the same crew carry on through economy, and trays remain until service is complete, and no drink refills are offered in the meantime. Water bottles were eventually handed out after meal service. Singapore economy class service is probably the best in the world, and on this flight the crew were superb. Unfortunately they do not seem to be committed to premium economy, and the enhancements which are provided by their competitors are absent. The primary justification for the “premium” price is space and comfort, which is provided, but having paid a not insignificant premium on the fare the expectation of an improved service level does not seem unreasonable.

"""my worst Economy flight ever""",5.0,D Keale,2019-10-08,"✅ Trip Verified |  Singapore to Adelaide. I dont know what happened to Singapore Airlines but just had my worst Economy flight ever. I am on the tall side with over 1.90cm but have had no issues on this flight over the decades on A310/A340/777/A330 in Eco and the occasional Biz class. My 1st time on their new A350-900 with their new economy seating and will be my last. The legroom is non existent.  My knees were in constant contact with the seat infront. If the person infront of you decides to recline then you get to enjoy the screen about 20cm from your face. The seats are an absolute nightmare. Not only is the pitch terrible but also the width which is a complete joke. If you are travelling with a family member then fine otherwise you get to enjoy constant shoulder rubbing with your neighbour. The seat padding is the hardest i have come across. Having flown Thai's A350-900 the weekend before to Bangkok in standard eco seat as well and having no issues, I was looking forward to the SQ experience. What an incredible let down that was. The Thai product is so much better which is something i would have thought I would never say when comparing to SQ. Even Emirates a few months before in Economy was an absolute joy in comparison. The inbound flight was a 23:10 departure and our dinner consisted of a beverage and a packet of peanuts before lights were turned off. 4 hours later breakfast was served which consisted of yoghurt, a bit of fruit, bread roll and flavourless noodles or omelette. Not being able to sleep, you had to play catch the crew walking past if you wanted water. Not being heavyset, the tray actually pushed into my stomach when folded out which was also a new experience. On the return leg I managed to get the extra legroom seat in row 55 which was fine legroom wise but it was even more narrow then the standard seat as the tray folds out of the armrest taking up width.

"""The damage is already done""",1.0,Stephen Thomas,2019-09-16,"✅ Trip Verified | London to Singapore. Very disappointed. The cabin service was fine, the flight was uneventful. I went to a great deal of time and trouble with Singapore Airline Officials in setting us up 6 months in advance with a seat choice that would accommodate my elderly mother being close to the lavatory. More than one phone call was made in a bid to secure a satisfactory response for this return and the outgoing flight on June 5. We ended up so far from where we wanted to be that the contempt I have for Airline Officials is significant. How on earth does an elderly infirm woman make her way to the back row when the walking device she uses is not allowed to come with her. I repeated many times that we would need an Aisle Chair, yet this was noticeably absent each time we boarded. Only after holding up the boarding, did an Aisle chair become available. I was so incensed after the first flight that I contacted SIA and told them what I really thought and their reaction for the return flight confirmed my long-held belief that this airline is only after my money and once that was in their possession - anything goes. Well I am not going to forget the battles I have had and the ignorance and contempt their administration has demonstrated on every occasion. They have lost me. The in-flight Service cannot override my sentiments. Do not bother if you are anything but a passenger who is happy to hand over your money and accept great service when your basic requests are treated so poorly. The Admin team is inept and say ""Yes"" to every request yet failed to deliver. The cabin crew could not believe the admin ignored me until I showed them the emails.

Other passengers could not pass us in the aisle and the journey to the lavatory took 10 minutes with the turbulence we encountered. No aisle seats was available in Business class despite a prior agreement that one would be aboard. I may as well have not bothered dealing with the airline. That SIA failed to deliver on this flight and the ensuing return later, shows the customer what the airline think of even their Business Class passengers - absolutely nothing.

The cabin is nearly always nice and the service is generally good although I have previously been left unable to eat as the only food left has been noodles with prawns and I have an allergy to prawns. On this occasion however we booked our tickets in business class and now that we attempt to select seats we are told we are unable to select the seat. The options are single seats spread around the cabin with no option to sit close to each other over a 12+ hour flight - that said we are still unable to book. We booked the tickets 10 months ago and I refuse to accept we were the last people to book this flight. We have contacted customer services to receive the answer seats are subject to availability. While I can accept that there are limitations on seating we are in advance of online check-in and were just checking available seats of which there are half a dozen dotted around the cabin.

"""there is nothing premium about the service""",7.0,Ken Howie,2019-08-19,"✅ Trip Verified | Johannesburg to Singapore in premium economy on the recently introduced second flight. Priority boarding after business class allows time to settle in, with ample space in the overhead lockers. Just three rows in the cabin, with good legroom and comfortable seats, which have a decent recline. There is a footrest on the seat in front, and a calf rest attached to the seat, which seems to serve no purpose other than create problems for the crew in trying to them stowed for landing. Good sized TV screen which is easy to operate. Overall the hard product is good. However there is nothing premium about the service, which is strictly economy. There are no pre take-off drinks, and there was no bar service after take-off prior to the meal. This may have been due to the late hours departure and a wish to serve the meal as quickly as possible, but one would have thought that with a maximum of 24 in premium economy this would not have been a big issue. Amenity kits are no longer handed out, but the menu indicated they were available on request. Meals were tasty, but the same as economy, served on plastic trays. No sign of table cloths and proper crockery as shown on the website. Drinks are served in plastic as opposed to glasses, and in small quantities. Wine was a basic white or red in a small plastic tumbler half filled. Fruit juice slightly larger serving, but still meagre. No offers of refills until the trays were eventually removed. There are no dedicated crew in premium economy. Service starts with premium, but then proceeds through economy, with clearing starting at the back of economy, so that premium economy is the last to be cleared. With the time difference the second meal was lunch. This time I ordered champagne, served in a plastic stemmed “glass” amounting to half a normal glass, again no refills offered until trays cleared, at which time the champagne had disappeared from the trolly. The main reason for choosing premium economy is space and comfort, on which there are no complaints.

In the past 10 year or so, we can clearly see many once premium airlines in the world have to resort to cost cutting, due to keen competition from low cost carriers and many other factors. Haven't not been on economy class of Singapore for quite some time, I decided to try it for it's a short haul flight plus it's price factor was very good this time. The usual high standard of SIA is there with the immaculately groomed kebaya-clad crew, and the good condition of the plane and its amenities etc. Hot towel service is still provided in economy class which is a nice touch. Menu is not given since it's a short sector. Hot drinks, cold beverages and meals are all served in one go, which cuts time and makes good sense. However, one can clearly see some cost cutting with the portion of the meal smaller, and the taste was rather bland and mediocre. Boeing 787 on the way to BKK was a fine plane, except the seat pitch and the aisle are all very narrow. Sat at the aisle, I was constantly bumped by the crew and passengers, there's almost nowhere foe me to hide as I wild be spilling onto my neighbour's space. It's quite frustrating really. Also the tray table is so close to my stomach, it's uncomfortable to say the least. Touch screen AVOD was very good, and pre-ordered duty free was dully delivered without delay. On return, SIA has a good lounge on concourse D of BKK airport, which is very close to the boarding gate, D6 or 7. A330, despite being an older plane, actually offered more seat pitch and slightly more space. No touch screen this time. The catering from BKK was better than from SIN.

"""absolutely appalled by the service""",2.0,John Mathiopoulos,2019-07-25,"Not Verified |  Such terrible service from the outset! After making the booking which included a code share arrangement for 2 adults with an infant, everything started well with a bassinet being requested. From that point I had to call at least four times with apparent issues with the names on itinerary even though they were correct from the outset. This issue arises again upon attempting online check in which wasn’t at all possible because one adults name was somehow written in twice, once as a Mr and one as a Mrs. called and requested a business class upgrade. Was told due to code share it wasn’t possible (hello I’m trying to give you my money)! Thereafter we arrived at the airport to a very rude staff member once again telling me the names were incorrect in the system, even though the night before I had the itinerary emailed to me from Singapore airlines customer call centre showing correct details, after the initial attempt to check in failed, which confirmed names were correct, I showed this document as proof, lady appeared uninterested. codeshare 2nd leg of journey had tickets produced at Melbourne airport by Singapore staff and after being flustered by this to and fro at check in I didn’t bother to check the seat allocation for the 2nd leg which didn’t have bassinet allocation. To our horror we discovered the Singapore Airlines check in lady had allocated us seats in different rows on opposite sides of the plane with a one year old! How can they be so unprofessional? The worst part, when transiting through SIN I approached the transfer counter of the codeshare airline, which is Singapore’s budget carrier Scoot and this helpful assistant was able to pair us together, making the MEL - SIN Singapore employees actions even worse. To top it off the flight wasn’t full, but also we cannot purchase additional baggage online due to once again the codeshare arrangement and furthermore we arrive at our final destination and discovered both our suitcases were broken with the wheels coming off before we exited the airport. Having flown many major international airlines overseas, I will never fly with Singapore again. It’s an indictment on Singapore Airlines that the service and experience on the 2nd leg operated by Scoot overall in SIN airport and on board was far superior to the Singapore airlines journey to SIN. If going Australia to Europe, I highly recommend you consider a Middle East airline that shows accountability and pride in their responsibility to fare paying passengers.

"""The seat was in a word, horrible""",7.0,K Pataporn,2019-07-04,"✅ Trip Verified |  Bangkok to Singapore . I was looking forward to flying Singapore Airlines and their new B787-10. I had set my expectations at the same level as Qatar Airways, seeing the fact that they are both 5-star airlines. With this in mind, I would firstly like to say that I was not impressed with Singapore Airlines, as they were quite inconsistent across the categories. The website is user-friendly, but I did encounter some glitches. Online check in is slightly confusing but I was able to manage. We arrived at Bangkok Airport 3.15 hours before our flight, and the check in counters opened 2.45 hours before the flight. It was extremely confusing which line is for which passenger, as they separate Business and Gold into different lines. In the end we were very quickly checked in at the gold counter. Luckily at that time of day security and immigration moved quickly. The Silverkris lounge in Bangkok is in a word, exquisite. The decor is very fancy and there is a manned bar with a barista making craft drinks and all sorts of coffee. Seats were plenty, clean and even the toilets are cleaned after every use! The breakfast buffet was slightly disappointing, but I have come to expect that with all airlines. Boarding was extremely confusing, they asked gold members to queue up with business class but the sign asks them to queue up at the economy door. Not only that, they board business class passengers first then gold members, which makes a mess! Other Star Alliance carriers just board gold and business at the same time. Hassle free! I received a warm welcome at the door, and found my seat. The flight attendant was even kind enough to help my mum lift her suitcase into the overhead compartment! I would never expect a flight attendant to do it out of the blue! The seat was, in a word, horrible. It was so narrow! Qatar Airways also has 3-3-3 seating on their 787s, but it wasn't this narrow. I'm slightly large, but even my rather small mum sat shoulder-to-shoulder with the other passenger in the window seat! Legroom was fine. What I don't get is that these aircraft with small seats are being deployed on flights as far as Brisbane, an 8 hour hop. However, the bad seat was overshadowed by the service. On my outbound flight from Bangkok, I chose a seafood meal and got the same thing I get all the time flying Star Alliance out of Bangkok, mixed grilled seafood served with tomatoes, peas and duchess potatoes. The catering was provided by Thai Airways, and even had the Thai Airways logo on it. Needless to say, it was very nice. On my return flight, when coming around for drinks, the lovely flight attendant noticed me checking the white wine bottle to see what it was, and I love the way she asked if I wanted the Sauvignon Blanc rather than""white wine.  The crew on Singapore Airlines are fantastic, and very hardworking. Entertainment was adequate, I wouldn't be bored even on the longest flight. On the return flight, we checked in 7 hours before departure time as we wanted to explore Jewel. Absolutely recommended. The gold lounge in Terminal 2 was an absolute disappointment! Even the Thai Airways lounge in T1 is better! Other than that, this flight was almost identical, except for some very strong turbulence. Overall, Singapore Airlines is a good choice.

I wasn't asked for a drink with our meals and the meals unfortunately didn't save the day either. Most of the time we had to queue at the lavatory (the layout of the plane for PE is horrible), because the 2 lavatories were used by Economy as well. The lavatory situation in Economy was much better, nobody surely had to queue there (11 lavatories according to the seat map!). It didn't help that a family with two toddlers and a crying baby was sitting in the same row. On the positive side were the headphones (even if they had to replace my headphones straightaway) and the entertainment system.

"""Such a disappointment""",5.0,David Killick,2019-06-03,"✅ Trip Verified |  Such a disappointment Christchurch to Singapore seats 33H and 33K, and SIN-CHC 32D and 32E in premium economy. We had really been looking forward to the new A359 taking over from the old 777 on the Christchurch to Singapore route with the choice of premium economy. Unfortunately, the bean counters seem to have designed the cabin! The configuration is 2x4x2 — just one seat less than economy — compared with 2x3x2 for Lufthansa in premium economy in the same type of aircraft, which we enjoyed for the next leg of our trip to Europe. The lavatories are the size of a small cupboard and there is no space to get up and stretch your legs in the cabin, unlike earlier aircraft. Going over was OK in the two seats by the window, but as others have pointed out, the central armrest and padded seatbelt (it contains an airbag) intrude on space. Inflight food and service was fine, if not memorable. Coming back overnight stuck in the middle seats was a lot worse. Space feels very tight. Not all menu choices were available, and we got beef mince, which was not very good at all. We asked for eggs for breakfast but got yam cake.

The red wine was awful. Throughout the flight the curtains to Economy remained open so that didn't make you feel the extra expensive brought any benefit.

"""Crew are a mixed bag""",6.0,T Nelson,2019-05-31,"✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Bangkok. Food standards have dropped drastically. Crew are a mixed bag - some attendants were friendly and helpful like the purser and supervisor and one attendant who went out of her way and offered to move me from my seat next to a crying baby and family to an empty cluster of 3 seats, 10 rows back before takeoff which was very kind of her. However, some attendants are grumpy and have zero manners. The seat feels exactly the same as a 10 in a row 777-300 on Cathay. Fairly acceptable for someone my height at 5’2 but could be uncomfortable for anyone bigger and on a longer flight. Food was terrible - fish was overcooked and the dessert was rubbery. Should have brought my own dinner instead. Only consolation was the Singapore sling and Bailey's I consumed that was not diluted with ice cubes. Hot towel before takeoff is a rarity in economy for any other airlines. In flight entertainment is excellent as always with lots of music and movies which distracted me from the lousy food. However, for the price I paid, I’d rather go with Thai Airways which has way better food and more consistent service.

But if we had not we would have been very disappointed as the menu selection was very average, more like economy offerings. The seat was the widest seat I have ever been in so no complaints here. However the inflight entertainment left a lot to be desired, very old technology and not easy to use. The mattress provided was not even fitting the bed which was not lie flat and no amenity kits provided. But the service from the crew was outstanding.

"""really felt disappointment""",5.0,Zvi Rosen,2019-04-22,"✅ Trip Verified |  My son and I flew Business class Singapore to Shanghai in April. The Business lounge in Changi is OK, but nothing to write home about. We ordered ' book the cook' option, one chicken Brest and one Steak dish. Upon boarding we were greeted by a very cheerful crew, the flight manager already knew my name without looking at any list. The seat was incredibly wide,but quite hard in my opinion. My tail bone tells me immediately, as I was injured in a ski accident, and I can't sit in a regular economy seat more than 2 hours. I was a bit disappointed, as Aeroflot  Business seat from Moscow to Shanghai was much softer and pampering. After take off I went to the bathroom, and upon my return I found the satay dish awaiting me. I only enjoyed the chicken stick. Then no service for almost 45 min, without one cabin staff in sight .Slowly the magic and excitement were wearing off. Eventually one  showed up and asked me if I didn't like it. I said I only liked the chicken and she offered me some more, nice gesture, but I declined. There were maybe 15 passengers in Business class,that I believe can fit 50-60 passengers. Not a tough flight for the crew. Then came a green salad, very average,and then my book the cook meal showed up, which was good. As I like to drink with my main meal, and my glass was almost empty, as it Lasted me through the salad and the Satay, it was time to refresh my glass,but not such offer. I buzzed the cabin crew,and asked for another glass of drink. I kept enjoying my meal awaiting my drink that never showed up. I buzzed the crew again,and this time the flight manager showed up, I asked to have my drink if possible with my meal not with the dessert. The Coke showed up in 5 seconds. Then came the dessert, a dish with Ice cream, no choices, and a Fruit basket, the most basic desert cart I ever saw. At that point I was already regretting the huge amount of money invested in trying to experience the top notch Business class.  Then I wanted to rest,but the crew must turn your seat upside down, very weird idea,and even with the thin mattress ,it was far from a pampering bed.IF you feel like sitting down again,you have to call the F/A to flip it over to a seat..Personaly I prefer control of my lying situation, rather than calling the FA. No amenity kit distributed, but I heard that they pass by with a choice of amenities that you may find necessary for your trip -  no such basket was offered. My 14 yo son told me after the meal that he still felt hungry. I called his flight attendant  who seemed amused by my statement and said she will 'take care of him' - she brought him a small pack of nuts. So much for generosity. At Aeroflot, upon hearing that my son was still hungry (growing boy,) brought him a pasta casserole from Business class. Free WiFi to Business class was a great idea.

"""not very well designed""",5.0,Glenda Sewell,2019-03-19,"Not Verified |  Singapore to London Heathrow. For my holiday to New Zealand in February / March this year I decided to upgrade my flights for all four legs of the journey to business class. Three parts of my journey were enjoyable, the service and food was good, even though I didn't receive the book the cook meals Id ordered. Sadly on the last leg from Singapore to London flight SQ322 I found myself on the A380-800. I found the business class section to be cramped, with a lack of storage space, not very well designed and for a new plane starting to show signs of wear and tear. The first problem was the width of the seat, it was a lot narrower than other seats in business class. I heard a lady behind me complaining to a stewardess about the hard seat. She replied that BMW had designed it. My thought was what is comfortable in a sports car is not so good on a 13-15 hour flight where you are sitting / lying down for nearly all the time. However with cushions it can be made more comfortable. Nothing can be done to make the seat wider and the high and very wide plastic infill between my seat and the window made me feel more cramped. I could see no useful purpose for it. The lack of storage space was a problem. I didn't want to put my carry on bag in the overhead lockers as it could be difficult / noisy to access it on a night flight. Unlike some other planes there was no small recess area where I could put my bag on the floor, but within my seating area, so the aisle was still clear. A stewardess put it on the floor but when the bed was out I couldn't access it without grovelling about on the floor. I made my bed up and tried to sleep. I placed my handbag on top of the large but fairly useless plastic infill, during the flight I think as a result of turbulence the bag fell on my head. I wasn't impressed at the time but later on I did see the funny side of it. As the seat / bed was narrow when I turned over I kept hitting my head. It was also quite difficult to get up from. I've had no such difficulties on other business class flights . The design, space and attractiveness is so much better on other Singapore Airlines business class cabins. I know the other passengers in my group flying in business on this flight were unhappy too. While I was queuing to leave the plane at the end of the flight a man of average height and regular weight said That thing is a waste of space refering to the plastic infill between the seat and the window. I had to agree. A senior stewardess told me the airline is planning to convert more of their planes to this design. Thanks for the warning. When I fly to Australia next year I will have to look for a new provider.

"""you lost a loyal flyer""",3.0,P Rachitra,2019-02-27,"✅ Trip Verified |  San Francisco to Bangalore via Singapore. I have flown Singapore Airlines from the past 20 years regularly until now, I considered myself to be a loyal customers. They used to care about customers before; apparently, being named the best airline in the world has gone to their head and they think they no longer have to satisfy their customers. I flew Premium economy recently to Bangalore and paid for the extra legroom seat--the flight was ordinary. I was expecting an offer to upgrade to business class before my flight and I have more than 50,000 pts. No such offer came--I tried to offer a bid, the system didn't allow me to. When I saw the flight, there were plenty of seats empty in Business class. Not sure why they don't want to offer the premium economy passengers to upgrade to business. Warning to everyone travelling from SFO--some connections to India have a very short layover--less than an hour. SA doesn't have any consideration that if the landing is a few minutes late and the connecting flight is within 30 minutes, they shouldn't make the passenger run from one terminal to another even using Skytrain. I barely made it before the gate closed (with my bad knees). Remember, you have to go through security in Singapore when you have a connecting flight. I had to rush from Terminal B to C with no time even to rush to the restroom let alone freshen up.  While returning from Bangalore, I had ~4 kgs extra. Instead of asking me to pay using my Krisflyer (over 50,000) points, Singapore airlines charged me for a whole extra piece. So watch out, even if you are just 2-4 kgs over the limit in Premium economy, they will charge the cost of a suitcase. I even asked to pay for the upgrade in Bangalore, the said I can't do it in the last minute using points and I should check during my layover in Singapore (~ 2 hours). When I tried to upgrade for the longer flight SIN - SFO, they said that I don't have enough points. I offered to pay with points and cash--they said I can't do that. They just didn't want me in Business class even with points or cash! I wanted to avoid paying extra weight fees as I would have below the limit int Business class. If this is not an example of not caring for customers or accommodating its Krisflyer members, I don't know what is. Why can't they charge per Kg extra weight instead of an additional piece of luggage like other airlines?   Flight and food was ordinary (food quality has declined from SF to Singapore), and the bathroom cleanliness both ways was not up to par like it used to be. Changi airport is exceptional of course. I am not sure I will  be flying this airline again while there are so many carriers who offer upgrades for a reasonable price and cheaper tickets. Not sure what to do with the balance points (more than 50,000 points) though.

Around 2 hours before landing, breakfast was served - the only negative thing about this flight, as the food was not really good in my opinion.

""" one of the best out there""",10.0,Jeremy Teng,2019-02-25,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flew Singapore Airlines on my trip back from Japan on their A350-900, and the experience was really positive. In Tokyo Haneda, check in was very efficient, despite it being a full flight (perhaps as many wanted to return home for Christmas), and boarding was very fast too, although the managing could have been better as I witnessed some passengers holding only an economy class ticket using the business class queue. Despite the inclement weather, the flight took off very quickly, and after we left Tokyo the flight was smooth throughout. Aircraft wise, the A350 had always been a comfortable aircraft, and this was no exception - the product offered was very comfortable, and the legroom was good even in economy class. The cabin crew was also very warm and friendly and attentive to every passenger. After meal service was concluded the lights were dimmed to allow the passengers to sleep, as it was a night flight. The IFE was touchscreen, just like my previous flight with SQ on their 787 and very responsive, no problems encountered. The only downside was that SQ did not implement a tail camera that can be broadcast on the IFE - a pity, considering that the A350 has the technology and other A350 users such as Cathay Pacific and Thai Airways are using them. Not an important feature, but it would have been really cool to see it. I picked the Japanese selection for my meal, and it was very good. We arrived in Singapore early and the crew was also very friendly throughout. During the flight, they even left me a personalized message on my passenger flight logbook, and it was a really touching gesture that showed how much they cared for their passengers. Overall, I would recommend SQ, although the prices might sometimes be a little higher, it is worth as you are paying for what you get, and SQ is definitely one of the best out there when it comes to cabin service, matching ANA, who are known for their exceptional cabin service.",A350-900,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Tokyo Haneda to Singapore,2018-12-01,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4,yes,Tokyo Haneda,Singapore,singapore airlines

Just after security check and with less than one hour to departure, we were told that there was a technical problem with the plane and we needed to switch plane (different gate). Amazingly, the entire flight was only delayed by 1 hour, which given the short notice, I feel is pretty amazing. Flight was on A330, which has the 2-4-2 configuration, and as usual, I opted for the (2) seat which I increasingly like. Seats were slightly narrower than the B777, but it just feels less cramped than the 3 seat options. Flight crew were slightly less charming than usual, but I guess the last minute change probably had something to do with this, and they still dealt very politely with some very demanding customers. Food was reasonably good (had Indonesian option), and IFE was as standard on the A330, if slightly dated. Only slight downside was the toilet, which although clean, had obviously seen better days with some wear and tear.

"""seat width is narrower""",8.0,Y Han,2019-02-12,"✅ Trip Verified |  Singapore to Denpasar. Having experienced United's version of the B787, this was an opportunity to revisit the experience on SQ instead on a short 2.5 hour flight. The initial entrance into the economy cabin is certainly more welcoming than United's experience. Once seated, you notice the high-density, thin seat cushions, which give you more perceived legroom than the standard 32 in pitch would suggest. Because SQ stayed with the 3-3-3 configuration, the seat width is narrower than the comparable A330 or B777 experience, and I certainly felt this was the case, despite the very narrow armrests. Certainly the aisles are narrow, and in the aisle seat, I was constantly jostled by passengers and assorted bags during the boarding process. I also found it hard to get comfortable on the thinner seats, though this was less of an issue for a short-haul flight. The IFE was a class above United's, with a large vibrant touchscreen and the newest KrisWorld experience (minus the seat controller), so all interactions are via the screen.

Singapore to Zurich is operated by an A380. This particular A380 that I was on is 6 years old and had the old business class product. The seat is very wide - the widest Business Class seat for any airline - sufficient to squeeze 2 slim Asians into the seat. To convert to bed mode, passengers had to pull down the seat back and raise the footrest. Because the footwell is located to one side, passengers have to sleep in a diagonal fashion. I ordered the lobster thermidor from Book the Cook. It was delicious. Cabin crew were very friendly and polite and addressed passengers by family name. After supper, it was time to sleep. A flight attendant deployed the bed for me and I had an uninterrupted 7 hours of sleep before breakfast. For breakfast I chose the Nasi Briyani, an aromatic Indian dish. Even at cruising altitude, the flavours and aroma of the dish was well preserved.

"""cabin crew were very polite""",10.0,K Pan,2019-02-04,"✅ Trip Verified |  Rome to Singapore. This was my first time on the A350. It was a rather empty flight from Rome to Singapore. The business class featured the new business class product where there were buttons to control the decline of the seat. However, to convert to bed mode, you will need a flight attendant to pull down the seat back from the upright position. This is the main bugbear of the Business Class seat. No amenity kit is provided on SQ business class but you can find toothbrush, shaving kit, comb, moisturiser and hand cream in the toilet. Only eye mask, socks and slippers are provided for long haul flights. On this route , I had the Milanese Osso Bucco for my lunch main course and it was delicious. Breakfast was served 90 minutes before arrival into Singapore and I had the Westerm option of sausage, mushrooms and omelette with corn flakes and fruits. As with other Singapore Airlines flights, the cabin crew were very polite, gracious and helpful and were able to anticipate passengers’ needs.

The air hostesses are usually very service minded in Singapore Airlines and thats why I used to like them. But the exception is this flight through Russia. The air hostesses are mainly Russian and do not meet expectations in my eyes of the usual level of service that defines this airline. Furthermore, when exiting the plane in Moscow, prepare yourself for a nightmare. 1 long line which consists of all the passengers on the A350-900, needs to line up for getting a red stamp in your boarding pass. Then you have to stand in a second long line to get a green stamp in your boarding pass. Then there was a third line to the x-ray of the hand luggage before you could stand (not enough seats to sit) by the gate without any restaurant, café or what so ever. And add to the misery that since i stupidly enough forgot my boarding pass to Moscow on the plane, I had to stand in a fourth line. Its very obvious this route is a failure.

I find the quality of service onboard below of that of few years ago, food standard and bland, staff with good hard-skills though (responsive, efficient and professional) but could be better - they talk very fast, robotic gestures and could be more smiling. On our inbound leg, they ran out of one food option which left us very disappointed. Seats on the Boeing 777-300ER larger and more comfortable compared with that of other premium airlines. For the outbound Jakarta-Singapore leg, they asked us if we wanted to take an earlier flight, so that we could have more buffer time transiting in Singapore for our next flight to Paris and not being too much in a hurry, which was a very good point.

Seats were comfortable but given that most seats were occupied, the cabin felt crowded. Lots of film choices on the seatback personal entertainment system, they were easy to access. Ample overhead luggage space. Leg space a bit tight. Seat reclination juts the backseat TV screen rather close to your face and the tray table to your tummy. In fact, the flight attendants, while serving meals, ensured that the passengers returned the seats to a more straight up position. A dinner and a breakfast were served. A multi page menu book was provided to all. There were two entree choices for both meals - no vegetarian choice. That was a shocking surprise. I chose the fish dish. It was amply portioned and tasty. The breakfast cold sandwiches were dry and virtually inedible. Predinner drinks were served in plastic tumblers from a tray that flight attendants carried - juice, beer, white wine were on offer. Dinner and breakfast cutlery were metal, not plastic. Duty free catalog was thick but nothing distinctive products on offer. Cockpit crew kept us informed of the flight and take off delays. Singapore Airlines should consider their impact on the environment - on this relatively short overnight flight they can simplify the breakfast and dinner, dispense with the paper menu and the basic amenities bag and ensure a vegetarian option as standard.

I eschewed the champagne and dinner for sleep, and here I still find the SQ PE seats very stiff and difficult to recline, it really takes quite a lot of effort to force the seat into a recline position. Nonetheless, there is a reasonable amount of elbow space, and the personal reading lights, noise-cancelling earphones and cubby holes give a sense of comfort. The IFE is the new touch-screen system with a separate seat controller handset. My IFE monitor refused to come out of it's housing, but the aircrew performed some magic with a knife and fork, and saved the day! Food (the breakfast that I tried) was reasonably good, and crew were proactive with drinks and snacks through the flight. The only downside of PE in the B777 series is that access to the shared toilets is at the rear with normal economy, and you have to manage the queues for access the best you can.

It turns out that the chicken with rice was too spicy. There were actually two choices (beef stew and chicken with rice) which left me wondering why they did not stop to ask my Sister what choice she wanted. They didn’t even tell her that the chicken with rice was spicy!  When the cabin crew came round to serve adults, they were very rushed and did not make themselves clear at all. They asked ‘stew or chicken rice?’. They didn’t bother to tell us what meat the stew was. And they also did not offer any drinks. You have to ask them yourselves.

During the meal service, there was no one asking me to refill the drinks when crews saw my empty whisky glass, is it very expensive? Most of the crews without any anticipations for passengers. I can remember a female crew, when I asked for help to lay the bed back before landing, she asked me to carry her service tray for her, exchange? When she helped a lady seating behind me to lay the bed back, she put the blanket around the side of my seat, somehow the blanket slapped my head and I was shocked, when I was seeing her she just realized and said sorry! All the small details reflected that there is no attention for the customers, but some of the SQ flights I took before was so different!

The premium economy cabin is relatively spacious with ample space for storage, and the seats are very comfortable.

Champagne is offered, but in a tiny plastic faux wine glass, and other drinks are also served in plastic tumblers that seem to become progressively smaller. Due to the timing only a light snack is offered. Although this was quick there was a long wait for coffee or drinks top up to be offered, and tables cleared, as there are no dedicated premium economy crew. Service is the same as economy, and although Singapore Airlines economy is amongst the best it does not match the premium economy service of other airlines such as Qantas.

"""my best economy flight""",9.0,F Marber,2018-10-11,"✅ Trip Verified |  Hong Kong to London via Singapore. Singapore Airlines is my best economy flight experiences so far. When I arrived at Hong Kong airport, I mentioned to the ground crew doing my check-in that I was concerned about any delay as I only had 3 hours of layover at London Heathrow when I had to clear customs and wait for my checked bag before I travel from terminal 2 to terminal 5 to catch the BA flight to Leeds. She called someone and then went to ask her superior when she couldn’t get answer on the phone to see if it’s possible to check my bag to Leeds. I knew they couldn’t do that when the two airlines belong to different airline partnerships (One World for BA and Star Alliance for SQ).  When I came back to Hong Kong a week later, I asked the ground crew at check-in if they might have any row of 3-seaters available,  ground crew looked to see if two rows that were blocked could be released. She then assigned the aisle seat, blocked the middle seat, and said she would do her best not to assign anyone to the window seat if possible.  I was able to lie down from London to Singapore. When they served the main meal, I told a flight attendant that I wanted Peppermint tea  and I brought my own as other airlines I have flown never had peppermint tea. He said they did. Not only did he bring me a cup, he also gave me a few bags of them for my layover at the Singapore airport. SQ has the most comfortable pillow for economy class in my experience. The blanket was twice the size and thicker than that of United. The economy passengers also got an amenitY kit (socks, toothbrush, toothpaste) .

The seats have definitely seen better days and struggling to get comfortable half way through the flight. Sat at the front of economy you could see how much better and new the premium economy seats and screens was compared to the aged economy seat, like two different airlines on the same aircraft. Crew like always had a smile on and did plenty of laps around offering water and cleaning. Toilets was also nice and clean and stocked with basic essentials, tooth brush, combs, moisturiser along with having hot towels before each meal helped you feel a bit more refreshed.

Hot towels and lots of drink refills even when flying over moderate turbulence. During the outbound flight, my inflight entertainment had no sound after an hour airborne and the crew initially wanted me to move to another seat at the rear of the plane but I rejected it as I had specifically chosen a seat on the wing for comfort. The leading crew and cabin manager eventually moved me to the first row of economy class on an aisle seat with extra legroom, insisting that I should enjoy my movie and sitcoms and also meant first to deplane! Service standards vary- local Singapore hires seem passionate and genuine but their overseas hires didn’t appear friendly. Inbound, the meal service did not start until 1.5 hours prior to landing as it was a redeye back to Singapore but the attendant serving my row was happy to heat up pot noodles for me. Chief steward was friendly and gave me a bag of free goodies having seen me carry two stuffed bears to ease my fear of it being extremely bumpy having read that the return flight would be going over a typhoon. Food option ran out but the crew let me have a vegetarian meal which tasted pretty good. Seat had issues reclining and two attendants pleasantly helped me make sure it worked despite taking 15 minutes or so.

Which is kind of interesting because, I like booking the SIA flight because they leave Frankfurt at 8:30 in the morning and arrive at JFK around 11, long before anybody else from Europe arrives, which is important in Terminal 4. So lunch was served at 10 am German Time. Why dont they give us a breakfast 9:15 and 2,5 hours before landing a lunch, which would make more sense.

Unfortunately the IFE was only on overhead screens, so it was quite boring flight. After the layover in Singapore, the ground handling for the 2nd leg was very good and boarding commenced with only slight delay. The service on this flight began shortly after takeoff, but it was a bit rushed during late dinner was served, and I didn't get the dessert. But since it was an ample and tasty dinner, I didn't mind at all since it was already 2am as well.

Singapore Airlines is very dependable and the standards always high as is expected of a 5-star airline. The check-in counters are almost always free or have no more than one other guest in front of you. This is something I never take for granted and often a welcomed relief especially if I have travelled quite far to get to the airport. Knowing that check-ins can be done in under 5 mins from reaching the airport is an experience I've always looked forward to when flying with SQ, no matter which country I am in. The check-in staff are always pleasant and polite which sets the tone for the rest of the journey. The welcoming experience is often replicated at boarding when a senior cabin crew checks my boarding pass and welcomes me on board. SQ sets itself apart from the rest of the airlines by showcasing their best and possibly their most senior crew at the boarding area. The inflight entertainment offers an excellent selection of movies and shorter programmes. More importantly, Singapore Airlines allows passengers to use the inflight entertainment as soon as they are seated.

Meals were very nice and enjoyed book the cook options. The flight attendants felt the need to wake me for meals, even when I had put the Do Not Disturb button on. Perhaps they could say at the start of the flight when meals are expected, or allow you to choose a time within a certain range? The IFE was excellent with a good choice of recent and older movies. I found the headsets pushed into my ears, which got a bit sore after a couple of hours. I wear glasses, so that might be the reason.

If travelling as a couple or pair, taking the window/aisle seats definitely gives you a sense of your own space, so this was a big plus. Legroom was reasonable. Service was up to the usual standards, although the most senior crew were sometimes a bit unsmiling. Food was average to good, depending on your choice, and the AVOD although not spanking new, was sufficient to entertain most for this 4 hour flight. The airplane is probably beginning to show it's age - it was a bit creaky and rattly on takeoff and landing, but everything is well maintained and perfectly comfortable.

There is only one con: space for legs/feet is very limited when seat is fully down, which is kind of annoying. Mattress is also not the softest. Blanket and pillows provided are of very high quality. No amenity kit provided. Personal TV has a big high-resolution screen with a broad selection of movies and channels to keep you busy. Service was really good, proactive and with a smile – that’s where Singapore Airlines shines the most in my opinion. Room for improvement is the food. Meals selection is quite good (including the Book the Cook option) but the meal quality is inferior to other airlines in Business (see Turkish Airlines or Qatar). Good champagne and extensive selection of beverages available upon request. Note of merit for the chamomile served along with pastries & chocolates selection. First flight on-time.

This time we took our adult daughter too - 'the shopper'. Unfortunately, all we saw of Changi was what we saw while running through the terminal, owing to our first connecting flight being delayed, then our second going tek and requiring us to change aircraft many hours later than our departure time. We were handed forms at the departure gate and an invitation to contact Singapore Airlines for future incentives. Infact, what we got in reply, months later, was in short: 'Safety first; we don't compensate for delays or connections - if missed' (all our flights were SQ). Tough luck. Therefore our experience of SQ is one we wouldn't recommend and as they state, they wash their hands of you if you miss a connection even in the event that connecting flights are both SQ. As a former employee of a British airline operating the very same aircraft I feel I have enough experience to say this is at best a poor outcome from SQ.

I have noticed a visible degradation in the quality of service over the years.  Ever since the introduction of the Premium Economy class, the quality of the service in the economy class has declined. The flight attendants go about their tasks mechanically, with little or no interaction with passengers. The food is mostly inedible. During my most recent flight, I opted for the Dim Sum breakfast between Hong Kong and San Francisco. The soggy, mushy items had no resemblance to Dim Sum items I have had anywhere. While US airlines such as Delta and United have vastly improved service for economy travelers, Singapore appears to be goading their economy passengers to upgrade to the significantly more expensive Premium Economy class.

"""how business class should be done""",10.0,P Beale,2018-02-27,"✅ Trip Verified |  Singapore to Brisbane. A great example of how business class should be done. Practically a brand new aircraft which features the latest Singapore business seats. The 1-2-1 configuration is perfect for privacy and easy aisle access. In my opinion, the hard product that Singapore offers, as well as the crew is what makes them stand out from the rest. The seat and entertainment system are great - and the seat converts to a reasonably comfortable bed. For a bit of extra room, I'd recommend the first row (Row 11) of business as there is a bit more leg space. Food was good and as I had ordered book the cook, my choice was already taken care of and served promptly after takeoff. Wine selection was good and my glass was never empty. The A350 features inflight wifi and Singapore now offers 30Mb for free to business class passengers which worked well for me and provided just enough to check emails a few times during the flight. The standout was the exceptional level of service provided by the crew. Business class was fairly empty (only 10 seats occupied on this flight), but as it was an overnight flight, it would have been very easy for the crew to disappear.

Singapore to Tokyo Narita.  Premium Economy Class Seats: Wider and well-cushioned. However, we were disappointed with quality. The buttons for recline and the foot rest was not working well. We actually had to force the foot rest out. This certainly isn't expected for Singapore Airlines (ANA on the contrary had everything in tip top condition). Entertainment: One of the airlines with the most decent entertainment. However, my headset was faulty. It was replaced but again, not expected. It should have been checked. Food: I used ""Book the Cook'. I expected the food to be better but found it so-so. Cabin crew took a really long time to clear the food. When I tried to return it, I was flatly rejected, the crew told me to wait. The entire process from start to end took 2 hours! It was crazy! SQ 633 was way much more efficient. Crew was pretty cheerful and the crew made the effort to confirm our meals with us before they took off. They surprised us with an anniversary cake as well. We like the customer engagement they provided. SQ 12 on the other hand appeared grouchy and unhappy to me - no confirmation on the food was made and they took so long to finish the meal service. Premium Economy has a cabin on its own. However, on both flights, the curtains were not drawn. We had passengers from Economy trying to sneak into the Premium Economy seats or use the toilets in Business Class. There were also kids (in Economy class) walking to and fro the Premium Economy cabins. This should have been controlled as my husband was trying to do some work on the plane and I was trying to rest but could not. While I try to be understanding on young children in the plane, it is definitely awful to have a child crying/screaming for 6 hours on a 7 hours flight. What made it worse was that seats with bassinets in the Economy class were directly behind the Premium Economy class. Overall, we were not very impressed with the quality of Premium Economy Class.

The panel which supposed to cover the compartment to store smaller items near the screen was missing, and the steward explained that only the engineering people can fix this. The seat was wide, however the awkward shape of the leg area makes it very hard to be comfortable, as we had to sleep diagonally (the new cabin product as we see online removed this problem). First class seats did not have this issue. Sleeper service (our flight departed at 10.50 pm) means that supper was only two course (instead of the three courses with Satay) - which was main meal and a bowl of fruit.

This sector was the second sector of my flight back from Vienna, the VIE-BKK sector being on Austrian Airlines. As a short 2-hour regional flight, SQ still lives up to its reputation of being a premium airline. Shortly after take-off, dinner service commenced with a choice of 2 main courses. Being a short flight, menu cards were not distributed to passengers. Instead, flight attendants showed passengers a menu card with photos of the main courses and descriptions of the meal. I had the chicken casserole with penne pasta. Drinks and coffee or tea were served at the same time. As it was a short flight, I did not watch any movies on the IFE. One difference that I noticed was that earphones distributed were of the in-ear type instead of the over-ear type typically used by SQ. Perhaps in a move to save costs, headphones in economy are no longer of the over-ear type?

From Brisbane, the B777-200er plane was a bit dated, noisy and the seats were comparatively hard. Some seats have IFE boxes taking up some foot space, and the entertainment selection is more limited than the newer planes (e.g. No full box sets). However the crew service with hot towels, amenities packs and attention to detail more than made up for it. The first leg was late departing Brisbane, but without even having to ask, the staff on the ground assured us by announcement that we would make up time en route and sure enough, we did, even arriving early into Changi. This was a relief for me as I only had a 50 minute connection time. The plane change at Changi was easy and seamless. The second leg was on the B77-300er. I found this plane less quiet than the A380 alternative on this leg, but still very comfortable. The ambient lighting and temperature were pleasant. The crew kept the cabin spotless, regularly removing rubbish and cleaning the toilets.

The first leg to Singapore was poor. The air crew are fully engaged with economy and consequently are not seen. The second leg was so much better due to the air crews attitude and attention. Ironically the second leg was economy. Certainly on the first leg premium on the 777-300 I do not feel the seat justifies the significant increase in cost. The majority of passengers around me had been upgraded from economy.

However the Boeing 777-200ER, is one of the more antiquated aircraft in SQ's fleet and it is in desperate need of a makeover - for one, the IFE looked like something that came from the 1990s or the early 2000s, and the IFE was not very responsive, and ended up jamming up 1hr before landing in Hong Kong. If that was not bad enough, my friend who was seated next to me(seat 45B) suffered from less legroom than other economy class passengers due to the IFE box that was under the seat in front of his. However, the service from the flight attendants was outstanding-no surprises as to why SQ can consistently rank as one of the top airlines. On the return flight, the equipment was the same; however, the aircraft came in late, and departure was delayed by 15 minutes! On top of that, after boarding we could not push back due to ""traffic congestion"" and ended up taking off 1 hour behind schedule!

Unfortunately, it has the worst customer service we’ve seen. Our return flight from Singapore to Paris was delayed by 3 hours so that we missed the connecting flight with Air France in Paris. All the flights to go home were full for the following 2 days. We had to buy by ourselves 2 train tickets (188 euros) to go back home. Our Air France tickets that we couldn’t use because of the delay were non-refundable. So we lost 246 euros because of SIA. After several mails to SIA (because they don’t reply to emails), the company doesn’t deign to pay 246 euros to compensate us. They only want to pay the difference between the train tickets end the Air France tickets (52 euros). Not logical. Plus, they don’t want to spend money to reply with postal mails. Only answers by email. Singapore Airlines don’t have consideration for their customers. They don’t take responsibility when their delayed flights have consequences on customers.

It's so massive and  super silent. I paid for the extra space seat, which turns out to not be a super good idea. You paiy for more leg room but got an entertainment system in the armseat that is less pleasant than the normal, so, I'd say that's not worth it. But, anyway, service was good, but not extraordinary. Food was not so good to be honest, I was a bit disappointed and the service was nice but, I didn't find anything that stands out compare to any other big airline in my opinion.

Both cabins were the new Business fit out and the seats (11K and 11A respectively) were of the new set up. The only issue is that I think there is a lack of storage space, and no drink tray (which is available on the A380) The A350 arrangement is newer of course and the individual cabin seems a bit smaller than those on the A380 and B777 (although the seat is the same width as on the B777). In reality the size seems to be on a good scale and uses the space well - it is very comfortable and all works well, and very roomy. Interestingly we were handed a small amenities kit on the Singapore to Barcelona flight - a first in my experience with SIA. The service on both flights was top notch and the attendants very friendly and attentive. The A350 flight seemed to be full, but the service was of a very high standard. We had a short stopover in Milan where we had to remain on the plane and there was a crew change. One of the flight attendants came up to say goodbye as she was leaving the plane. Very personal service. The A350 is a terrific plane - very quiet (much more so than the B777) and very smooth. I did feel better after this flight than other long haul flights so maybe the extra humidity and air pressure and better air conditioning worked.

"""an inconsistent experience onboard""",7.0,Adler Tan,2017-07-20,"✅ Verified Review |  Flew from Jakarta to Singapore return. Our outbound leg was operated by a brand new A350. Despite the usually unremarkable ground service in CGK, we walked into the plane with high expectations, being known as a prestigious carrier here in Indonesia. Our previous flights with them has also been excellent. However, walking out of a Singapore Airlines plane for the first time in three years left us wanting for more. Sure, the A350 was an excellent aircraft in itself, with a spacious cabin, larger windows, high-tech LCDs for overhead signs and increased humidity, but unfortunately the flight experience overall has fallen miserably compared to our past flights with them as well as with competing airlines. Seat comfort was good but not great due to the hard leather headrests. Seat width was great, while pitch was nothing remarkable. Service was noticeably rushed, though crew were still professional, efficient and quite friendly. IFE was the most sophisticated and content-loaded I have ever experienced - complete with an extremely high resolution remote controller. However, it was not useful other than accessing shortcuts and viewing brief flight information. And then the food came: every single portion of the meal was lackluster - very severely below industry standards. Also, the ding sounds were played excessively throughout the flight, at an ear-splitting volume - they rung at least once every thirty seconds. How incredible. What's more, turbulence kept coming and going throughout the entire flight as well, and when it was time to land, we hit the ground very hard. Kudos to the pilot. The return flight was operated by a 16-year old 777-300, a stark contrast to the brand new A350 of the previous flight. However, this was much better: food quality was raised to industry standards - good, but not great, service was friendlier, but still far from the best out there, seat comfort was elevated thanks in part to the very soft and plush leather headrests; the constant ding sounds were replaced by an overall calmer ride interspersed with brief periods of turbulence. But what impressed me was the amount of space that each passenger in Economy Class receives: the amount of legroom was mind blowing. I could stretch out and still not feel claustrophobic. However, this flight also comes with its own share of flaws: crew service was not as efficient - they spent the first 20 minutes of cruise heating up food, and this caused my row to get the food only 30 minutes before arrival, and we finished our desserts as the plane was already midway through descent. Also, the IFE system is ancient and is in desperate need for a upgrade. The screens were also falling apart as well.

The seats are a bit bigger, but sometimes I feel like I'd rather have a window seat in economy and wedge myself into a comfort. It is handy if you want to do some work on your laptop during the flight, but not if you want to sleep. Singapore Airlines is a reasonable premium economy class option, but not as good as Qantas. The food is standard economy which I think should be expected. The extra money is paying for the seat. But I battled in it and didn't find the extra space that worthwhile.

"""this flight was a terrible disappointment""",2.0,Richard Todd,2017-06-21,"✅ Verified Review |  My wife and I flew to London last week, with a Singapore stopover, choosing premium economy because we had a great experience flying on Qantas premium economy. We expected Singapore Airlines, another favourite carrier, to offer a similar product, and we had both had good Singapore Airlines flights before. But this flight was a terrible disappointment, and poor value for money. We are not looking forward to the return flight next month. With Singapore Airlines premium economy, you get a wider seat and better leg room. At the airport you check in separately, and there's a more generous luggage allowance. But that's all you get. We got the same food as economy (poor food compared to previous Singapore Airlines economy flights). The flight attendants served us and a large chunk of economy. Perhaps they were run off their feet: the only smiles were the neon-light style: turn on a smile and instantly turn it off again. When the food trolley came along there was a bottle of red and and a bottle of white wine on the top, but it was not offered. We were asked simply whether we wanted tea or coffee. I requested a glass of red, and was given it. I've no idea what sort of wine it was. The curried beef meal was poor economy class food at best, and far from what Singapore Airlines has offered in the past. Nobody came around after the meal to offer more wine, tea of coffee. After each meal, it took half an hour for anyone to come and remove our trays, so we were stuck in our seats and unable to go the toilet. My wife eventually lost patience and took her tray and returned it to the kitchen herself. Flight attendants were there, but offered no thanks or apology for the delay in retrieving the trays. On the long night flight leg to London a day later it was much the same. We were not even offered eye masks, though I was given one when I requested it. I've never flown an international night flight before when an eye mask wasn't offered. The curtain between premium economy and economy was never closed on either flight, and children from economy wandered into our aisle at will. As we approached London, our last meal was a breakfast omelet of rubbery texture, which seemed to underscore the whole mediocre experience this premium economy flight had been. But it hadn't finished yet: On arrival at Heathrow, people in economy poured from their seats into our part of the aircraft before the seatbelt light had been turned off. No flight attendants told them to stay in their seats until those ahead of them had got off, not even a cabin announcement. Most cabin announcements during were barely audible, even in an aircraft as quiet as an A380, so that might not have made much of a difference. To sum up: we used to praise Singapore Airlines to the skies, but the scales have fallen from our eyes.This was an appalling way to start our holiday, and it will take a lot to get us to return to flying with this airline again.",A380,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Sydney to London via Singapore,2017-06-01,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1,no,Sydney,London ,singapore airlines

"""improve the overall pleasantness""",4.0,M Gerten,2017-05-27,"✅ Verified Review |  Hong Kong to Surabaya via Singapore. I have been flying with Singapore Airlines in Economy a couple of times in the past and was under the impression that I really like flying with them. However, my recent two legs felt mediocre at best and made me question my general stance. The crews seemed disorganized, very mechanic, and provided slightly chaotic and/or unnecessary stressed meal services. The first beverage service consisted of pre-filled cups with wine and beer served from a tray that the FA carried through the aisle. Kinda strange. Why not hand out little wine bottles (as Lufthansa does) and cans of beers instead? If no one takes the cups, do they pour them out? The planes were fairly old, featuring ancient inflight systems. I also dislike with Singapore Airlines that during online set selection, one is only being shown very few available seats - and when you sit down, the seats that were shown occupied suddenly are empty, while the one next to you which was shown available is occupier. I understand that there always are last minute changes but I still notice a repeating pattern; with other airlines (within Star Alliance) I usually am able to make smarter seat choices than when flying with SIA. The food was good. Overall, if Singapore Airline wants to maintain its position as a serious premium airline, it has to improve the overall pleasantness of the flight experience. The fare was not cheap (yet the booking class made it hard to earn miles outside of Krisflyer), and mediocre doesn't justify a significant higher price than what the low cost competion offers.",Boeing 777-200 / A330-300,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Hong Kong to Surabaya via Singapore,2017-05-01,4.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,3,no,Hong Kong,Surabaya ,singapore airlines

Dining experience was slow - the cabin crew on the other section of economy cabin even had finished their service completely while the cabin crew on my section had just finished halfway. Another thing was there was no consistency since the crew started from wrong direction. Usually they start their way form the front to the back but this time one section within the economy cabin started from the front and the other from the back. By the time they have reached my seat, they said there was no more choices so I had to take what was left. Furthermore, on the meal tray itself, my salad or appetiser food container had no cover. Since the crew on my section was so slow; therefore, they expected us to finish our meal so fast so they could clear up. I have traveled with them a lot and I have been in business class.

Didn't bother complaining as crew was nowhere to be found after meal service and were happy to switch off lights and disappear. Entertainment system, a bit dated, probably the original system used with the first A380 flights and some buttons required a harder press on the remote as had been worn out. Had about 200 movies but I mostly listen to music while flying. Choice of music was mediocre, so decided to use my iPod instead. No free WiFi quota.

The service is great, a regular drink tray with waters and juices being brought to you to keep you hydrated. The food was decent for economy class standards and they also offered a small snack (sandwich) and second meal. A small amenity pack was provided and consisted of a toothbrush and socks - nothing special but still a tick in the box which some airlines have cut back on. The headrest of the seat is comfy and is made of leather which gives it class. Ambient lighting during the night hours gave a relaxed and upmarket feel. The best part of the Economy seat was the entertainment system which consisted of a large screen - bigger than an iPad size and then has a small digital control below; it all works well and is also touchscreen and the quality and size is better than I've seen on BA business 747. Overall the most comfy and best way to fly direct to Singapore from London in economy class but price will still dictate choices and whilst I'd pay a small Premium to fly Singapore again a harder discount from BA or Garuda would sway me.",Boeing 777,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Singapore,2017-03-01,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4,yes,London,Singapore,singapore airlines

Firstly if you ""Book the Cook "" a pre-ordered meal, it will be served long before anyone else. The promised champagne and drinks service did not materialise and staff did not curtain off the cabin from economy and were constantly moving through the cabin to serve economy passengers. This is an expensive airline with a lot of online hype about the premium economy service.

Unfortunately this flight has no WiFi despite it being a B777-300ER plus flying out at 0700 one would expect a little breakfast. Sadly there was no meals until 12 noon Singapore time which means about 3pm Sydney time. I overheard an American passenger asking for some food as he was hungry.

"""Service lacked enthusiasm""",6.0,Viral Ladhani,2017-02-28,"✅ Verified Review |  Singapore to Munich, and travelled this sector twice within 6 months so my review is based on mix of both. Boarding at Changi is consistent and zone wise boarding. Check-in staff, passport and boarding card checks are very friendly. On boarding the flight crew looked less enthusiastic then I know of. There was a sense of disorganisation. The senior crew jetted through cabin with a frown and certainly created a negative environment. Once in the air, meal and drink service was conducted. I use book the cook service and was served about 30 mins before fellow passengers which I find bit awkward. Again, the meals can be elabotate for this class but I found portions are small and not filling. Service lacked enthusiasm, warmth and smile on both the sectors and cabin crew were indifferent. Some were good and some were kind of forced to work. SIA provides good entertainment system so while watching movies, I decided to get a snack from middle galley and crew were friendly but didn't see them throughout the flight atleast on my side of aisle. On one of the flight, I asked for a coffee and it was brewed very strong even by European standards with the reason given that Europeans only drink strong coffee. The crew in back galley were sad and angry. On the positive side, SIA 777-300 has spacious toilets. Entertainment system is good and seat is spacious enough for the class. All in all, MUC flights are out of Singapore Airlines pattern. I read review of another passenger in this forum also travelling to MUC and found to be negative.

"""generous seat width""",10.0,J Choo,2017-02-24,"✅ Verified Review |  Singapore to New York via Frankfurt. I have flown the SIN-NYC route 4 times in the last 15 months. In my earlier trips, I flew with a large European carrier and two different Middle Eastern carriers. I last flown SQ on this route over 8 years ago so I can compare the recent experience with that from 8 years ago. The main thing to me that distinguished SQ service from competitors is cabin crew service. One thing which I felt was lacking though is the smiles that SQ's crew used to be famous for. Some of the more senior staff still has that touch and could make a positive impression but increasingly, I noticed in my last 8 or so flights on SQ in the past 12 months, that the crew are no longer as at ease or friendly as they used to be. A small minority seem a little indifferent which drags SQ reputation down. Their service adds a shine to the brand even though the hardware is not as impressive as the Middle Eastern carriers. A380 feels older compared with the B787s and A350s that many airlines are now using. Despite the older planes, I find the generous seat width a life saver. Other details include lights under the IFE screens which gave good coverage for each passenger's immediate area but do not disturb surrounding passengers. Another detail is the foot pedal activated trash bins in the toilets, helps not having to push the bin's lids using our hands. There was good crew presence throughout the entire flight. The food portion is generous and quality better than other carriers I have flown.

We left DUS in time. The service followed with hot towel, drinks and nuts and meals. Using book the cook service means getting your meal before your fellow passengers. The meal was okay and we were offered three choices of warm bread and big selection of fancy drinks. After meals, they served ice cream but missed on me, where a crew assured that they are not offering it to me since I am vegetarian and ice cream contains gelatine. Since it was a day flight, crew was actively anticipating needs and were very busy serving to a group of very demanding passengers in economy. This flight had dedicated crew for Premium Economy and they came around at least 3 times to assure if everything is fine. Many rounds of snacks in a basket and drinks on tray and crew looked enthusiastic, service minded and very friendly. We were made to feel like welcomed guests.

I've flown Singapore Airlines in Economy Class long haul several times and been satisfied. On this occasion I decided to opt for Premium Economy. I was flying from Auckland to London via Singapore but the first leg was on Air New Zealand, and I recommend their Premium Economy service. Singapore Airlines seats have a bit more space and legroom than Economy, and the in-flight entertainment screens are bigger, but otherwise everything was identical to Economy class. I'm a vegetarian and I had the exact same two meals I had in Economy class three weeks earlier, and I didn't enjoy them the first time around. My companion ordered the ""book the cook"" and his meals seemed better quality, but none of the available options were vegetarian. For the breakfast service they completely forgot to offer us a drink. The service was bored and impersonal throughout, the flight attendants were rushing around and didn't smile. The toilets are shared with Economy class. For sleeping I didn't find the seats significantly more comfortable than regular Economy and the fixed central console means you can't stretch out over any adjacent empty seats. That said I'm only 5'3"", my 6'1"" companion did appreciate the extra legroom. The entertainment selection is extensive and the noise cancelling headphones good. However, we were in the front bulkhead seats and the screens were set on the wall ahead of and were too high for comfortable viewing, there are also irritating advertisements ahead of each programme.

A recently renovated 777-300 was exceptionally comfortable and provided the basis for an excellent trip if only the crew had cared. All crew members were well presented as always but those serving my part of the cabin showed a low level of enthusiasm about their jobs. It started with a 40 minute wait for a glass of wine and water, there was a similar 40 minute wait for a coffee in the morning. Offered a regular meal as opposed to the special meal I had pre-ordered at both dinner and breakfast, indicated that they weren't paying much attention. Not called by name once, just ""sir"" with a half hearted apology at dinner re the offer of the initial meal and then when asked if I would like desert a pointed response to me when asking what it was, being told ""I have no idea, you ordered a special meal"". Dinner was very watery as I don't think that the water from the vegetables had been drained and so the gravy was more like a soup. Breakfast omelette was cold. After I asked for the regular cereal to be taken away, I think that they began heating the special meal I had ordered only at this point. When it was served 10 minutes later half of it was cold to the point of being refrigerated. Not offered water between meals, had to go to the galley each time. While not the fault of the airline, it was topped off by a nearly two hour wait at customs. There was no immigration officer at the ""crew only"" queue and the crew went through our queue so they were off long before the passengers. We were behind a very slow moving contingent of Air China passengers. By the time I got to the baggage so much time had elapsed our flight was no longer listed and had to go to the Lufthansa bag desk to find out which carousel to go to.

Fresh fruits, sandwiches, chocolate waffles and crisps. The crew was also courteous enough to inquire if they could do anything so that I can sleep for a while. I also noticed that crew went through cabin couple of times to anticipate our needs.

"""service was slow and disappointing""",1.0,S Claezer,2017-02-11,"✅ Verified Review |  Perth to Munich via Singapore. This is a review of the flight SQ328 from Singapore to Munich on 10th February. The ordeal started in Singapore. While the flight was not marked as delayed, the departure time had been pushed back by 35 minutes on the airport screens. When I inquired, the answer was that ""we are using the first available aircraft"". Nice indeed. Singapore Airlines obviously works under the premise that changing departure times because of missing aircraft does not mean a delay. The flight boarded in accordance with the displayed delayed departure time. However, once on board, nothing happened at the departure time. No announcements were made. After inquiring again, the captain condescended to make an announcement that he was waiting for other passengers to join the flight. When inquiring a 3rd time what additional time we would be looking at, I got told that the captain is unable to tell. After an estimated 15 additional passengers had come in during additional 45 minutes of waiting, the aircraft finally taxied out to the runway. However, while several other aircraft passed us and took off, we were sitting in a parking spot next to the runway. This time an announcement was made that we ""have a few aircraft ahead of us"" - after about 20 minutes, the captain told us that his flight plan had expired and the route to Munich had been closed because of the long time we waited for other passengers. The result was that we had to taxi back to the gate from which we had left, in order to get a new flight plan and refuel the aircraft. This exercise cost another hour. In summary, it may be justified to wait for connecting passengers from delayed flights. However, the captain should have communicated honestly and, in particular, never taxied out to the runway. It is unprofessional and proves utmost incompetence to do this without a robust flight plan. He could have easily obtained an adjusted flight plan while we were sitting at the gate waiting for the connecting passengers from delayed flights. His lack of planning and anticipation skills are very concerning from a passengers's view. What does the guy do if anything unforeseen happens in the air? To add to the picture, the aircraft was worn, old and super noisy. The service in the back of the cabin was slow and disappointing when compared to previous Singapore Airlines standards. This was the second encounter of disappointing Singapore Airlines service in four flights on my recent trip. Things seem to go south at Singapore Airlines.

"""the seats were spacious""",8.0,M Sanders,2017-01-22,"✅ Verified Review |  I flew on Singapore Airlines (SQ) from Sydney to Chennai via Singapore last December. This was my first time on SQ and was quite excited about the journey as I had heard a lot about them. General: All my flights were on-time infact some arriving a bit earlier. The seat allocation in manage booking was restrictive when compared to competitors. I wanted to allocate a window seat and it was showing as all the seats were taken. Luckily when I checked-in, it showed one window seat on each sector and I was able to take it. Not sure why SQ should make it complicated. I do understand they have to block some seats to cater to their frequent flyers etc.. but that doesn't mean you block the whole flight. Value for money: The ticket prices are on the higher side compared to competitors. However, I am willing to pay for quality hence I would opt for SQ. Ground service: Ground staff in both Sydney and Singapore were friendly and the check-in process was smooth. Seat comfort: The seats were spacious. Though I am average sized I felt even a bigger person would be able to sit comfortably. Cabin staff service: Cabin crew are one of the friendliest in the world. Prompt service. My only disappointment was when a request was made for some additional alcoholic drink (within usual limits in a competitor), I got a feeling that the crew were not enthusiastic. I am not sure whether this is due to the airline policy or it was the cabin crew's perspective. Also when you request a spirit, its taken like a special order which will come after a while. Ideally they are supposed to have it along with the other drinks (like other competitors do) and should be served instantly. Food & beverages: The quality of food was excellent. The quantity could be a bit more but I will live with it. Inflight entertainment: One of their weakest points. In this current era of touch screens, we have to use remote control on both their A380 and A330-300 fleet. Also the choice of movies are very limited, a cheap take-away earphone and outdated software. I wouldn't mind if they provide a better headset and collect it at the end of the flight. I have read that their retrofitted B777-300ER and A350-900 come with touch screens. But that doesn't help anyone as A380 and A330-300 still forms a bulk of their fleet and are deployed on key routes. As an aviation enthusiast I used to enjoy the onboard camera with a competitor, unfortunately its not available on SQ.

This time I arrived last night and my baggage never appeared on the carousel. I went to report it missing to be told that I didn't check in any baggage.

After numerous calls in the morning, I was told my baggage had turned up on another carousel at T3, and they would call me when it was being delivered. That was early this morning, it is now 4.30pm and I cannot get though to the ""hot line"" to check if they could give me an approximate time, no joy there either.

The flight was departing behind schedule due to passengers who did not turn up and a time consuming de-icing process. I am glad I did not take the Premium Economy upgrade offer. Walking through the Premium Economy section during boarding I did not experience much added value by looking at the hard product, compared to Y. The seats look pretty narrow as well and not that much pitch. The business seats look great though. The Economy product is very nice in my opinion. Seats are maybe a little bit narrower than in the Boeing 777-300, but the pitch was good (I am 1.80m tall, enough space), decent recline and a huge entertainment touch screen which was awesome. The cabin felt spacious because of the high ceilings. Also higher humidity. Great aircraft! I was very dissapointed in the cabin noise level.  Yes, take off was less noisy but not during the flight itself. I think it will be less noisy in front of the aircraft but not sure about that.

Good communication from flight deck regarding arriving terminal and local weather. Cabin crew on both legs ensure that the restrooms were always cleaned and in pristine condition. Entertainment system was easy to use, a slightly older version without touch screen, and even though it may not have an obscenely extensive entertainment choice like Emirates, they have a large collection of movies and TV series including new releases that is more than enough to keep you entertained throughout both legs.

MEL to SIN in Economy, an older plane with inflight entertainment screen to boot. The screen was awful, so if you flying on another SIA flight, hold back and watch the movies you want to watch on a better screen. Service was very average, IFE was poor, food was very poor. Singapore to London in Premium Economy The only advantage in taking premium economy is the seat pitch and thats it. This is a very poor attempt at premium economy and it is a complete rip off. Inflight entertainment was poor, a much larger screen, so great for movies, the only plus. My small hand held control panel did not work. The entertainment system kept resetting itself at the end of every movie or programme. One ear in the headphones did not work. Service was poor - In premium economy you are placed in front of economy and behind business class. The service is provided by the economy cabin staff. Could not call for service as my hand held control panel did not work. The toilets are down in economy, none near premium economy. Food was very Poor -  Economy class food. The only reason why I've given a score of 2 is because they have the book the cook service, but that is still economy class standard food. Remember, you are paying double the price for this seat. Flight arrived 25 minutes late. Return legs London to Singapore in premium economy was exactly the same but this time the entertainment system kept resetting itself, the headphones worked and so did the hand held control panel. Singapore to Melbourne in Economy - the breakfast on economy is as poor as you get with airline food. A cold bread roll, hard cold butter, cold muffin, cold unripe fruit.  The TV screen on this plane was up to date but still had issues with it freezing. We had a seat between us, so basically it was the same as flying premium economy but without paying twice the price.

"""high standard of service""",8.0,Jinwei Zuo,2016-11-15,"✅ Verified Review |  Flew Singapore Airlines from Melbourne to Singapore. Departure airport was quiet that day due to industry-wide strike. Anticipating delay and congestion, somehow I checked-in and cleared custom in a breeze, which was quite a surprise. Orderly boarding accompanied by cabin crews repeated welcomes, no one has rushed and despite the rear cabin being full, it remained quiet throughout the journey. I had prepaid extra for the Preferred Seat 48A on-board the new A350 with almost unlimited leg room - there's no seat in-front, thus moving in or out of the seat without disturbing fellow passengers alone was worth paying extra for. However, the seat does come with its own design flaws. Once the PTV is pulled up, it physically creates a wall in between 48A and 48B, not only reducing 48B's already limited personal space, it also made plugging in USB charger an additional hassle. Furthermore, reduced seat width and immovable armrest are just another two trade-offs if extra leg room is preferred. Nevertheless, the amount of seat recline did appear adequately generous. The flight took about 7 hours, there were two meals served - one dinner and another light meal. The size and taste of its meals have noticeably deteriorated over the years, e.g., the size of the tray has been reduced significantly, just to name one. I found the IFE content rich and diverse, especially the music library - I enjoy listening to music while watching the moving-maps. I didn't use the WiFi, thus unable to comment.

The cabin crew very good, looking after our wellbeing throughout the whole flight, even on a long 12-hour flight as this one. The food was delicious, I had diet-meals on all flights and they took great care of me. One minor thing: the toilets on the A350 look very small. From Singapore to Melbourne I sat at 37G. This was an older version of the B777-300ER, with an older inflight entertainment system and more important not enough legroom. My knees were stuck against the seat in front of me. Cabin crew good, food was excellent and the 6 hour flight was over in a blink. On the return flight in from Melbourne to Singapore I changed seats the day before and sat at a window seat. This B777-300ER looked more modern and the legspace was much more than on the way into Melbourne. Again a very pleasant flight with a pleasant cabin crew. Only the last hour we had a bumpy flight with thunderstorms above Indonesia and Singapore, but the crew and pilots did a good job.

All in Premium Economy. The principal airline booked was Air NZ and their service in Premium Economy was excellent. Unfortunately our flights from Auckland to London via Singapore were very poor. The standard of Singapore Airlines Premium Economy was inferior to Air NZ and to a lesser extent Virgin Atlantic. Singapore Airlines Premium Economy is marginally superior to Economy class and vastly inferior to their Business Class. During the first hour of my flight from Singapore to London I made my concerns known to the senior cabin steward. He made a mental note but did nothing to show any reparation for the poor service except that he admonished his junior staff for serving wine in clear plastic beakers as opposed to the glass beakers provided alongside the plastic foil-topped water on the food tray. He explained that Singapore Airlines were relatively new to offering Premium Economy class. No welcoming drink, no menu in seating area, alcoholic beverages served in plastic cups, meals of appallingly poor standard, coffee disgustingly bitter, wines of a poor standard. Apparently champagne was available but it was not offered to passengers and I only became aware of it after a chance conversation with cabin staff while waiting to use the bathroom.

Today I’m sitting on a regular next gen biz class seat on SQ. I’m tall and with this seat if you’re sitting straight up (or slightly angled) you cannot stretch your legs straight ahead for you hit the seat in front. So to stretch out you have to sit sideways to put your feet in the allocated space. Thus, you also need to place a lot of cushions for back support so that you don’t feel the corner of the seat into which you’re leaning. Once you get into position it’s OK. But initially it feels uncomfortable for you’re sitting sideways. It also feels more extreme/tight compared to the older version of this seat. Given how many great new business class seats there are out there where you stretch out straight ahead, I think Singapore Airlines is soon going to have to change this seat configuration to stay on top. It is fine for medium-haul flights, but I think for the super long-haul flights it would become uncomfortable. A small detail that I love on these newly refurbished planes is the toilet seat handle.

"""not let instruments as carry on""",1.0,P Gallin,2016-09-22,"✅ Verified Review |  Brisbane to London via Singapore. Would not recommend flying with Singapore Airlines if you are a musician who values their instruments. Never had any trouble with taking my guitar on other flights but as I went to book into my flight at Brisbane I was told that it was not company policy to let people take instruments on board and that I'd have to stow it under the plane. After a long discussion with the manager about how I've never had any trouble before and that it'd easily fit in an overhead onboard the aircraft she said to come back to the desk at around 9:30 when the crew would arrive, so I could ask them if I could be made an exception. I came back at 9 to be told that the crew had already arrived and said no so I would have to stow the instrument, I was then made to sign a form to waive my right to sue if the instrument was damaged before boarding the aircraft. I was assured by the staff that the guitar would be treated with the utmost care and I tried to put it to the back of my mind and enjoy the flight. Upon arriving back home I'm sad to see the wood on the head of the guitar has split and two of the tuning pegs have been damaged meaning my guitar which has traveled the world with me is now no more than an expensive ornament. What made me really dissapointed was being told there wouldn't be enough room on the aircraft for my guitar and then seeing 3 overhead compartments directly next to me free of any carry on luggage and plenty of seats free for it to have been stored. I know it's not Singapore Airlines policy to let people take instruments as carry on but I'm less than impressed about being lied to about not having enough room onboard and the fact that every other airline I've flown has had no problems with it.

Previously I flew Etihad to India via Abu Dhabi. However Etihad has 10 abreast seating on the 777 and it was a 14 hour flight and very uncomfortable. I chose Singapore Airlines for the 9 abreast seating on the 777 and the 8 hour flight to Singapore which was much more enjoyable. The service with Singapore Airlines was excellent including hot towels and fantastic cabin crew. Changi Airport was a beautiful place to visit and Singapore is a beautiful city for a stopover.

SQ did not offer A380 business class seats for our travel dates from Delhi. Flight timings were convenient as the flight happened throughout the day bringing passengers into Bali via Singapore by late evening. The service was excellent, barring a negative moment on the SIN-DPS sector. Ground staff in New Delhi were kind to allow me to hand in a package to my driver which I was careless about. They collected it at the gate and made proper inquiries with me before agreeing to handover the envelope to my driver who came to collect it later. SilverKris Lounge in DEL was average in terms or service or offer and reflected the usual attributes of airlines offering mediocre service at Indian airports. Due to Indian regulations no champagne is served on boarding Business Class in India. Flight attendants were friendly and the business class product had no concerns. In-flight entertainment options aren't as large as Emirates, but had an eclectic selection of movies to select from. From SIN-DPS, we encountered a scenario which left a sour taste of the experience. The offered menu had an option of beef. Living in India good beef is hard to come across, so the plan was to indulge in beef on the way to DPS, since beef options were not available on the DEL-SIN sector. On requesting for a beef dish, I was advised that they had run out of beef and was offered the option of chicken or seafood. No apologies or offers to check if an economy meal was available. My partner chose not to have a meal since he wasn't keen on the seafood or the chicken. At this point three members of the cabin crew apologised profusely to him and assured him that they would do anything possible to make things better. At this point my partner asked the crew why the same apologies or service recovery efforts were not made with me, and the crew member simply mentioned, 'I'm sorry but we weren't aware that you were travelling together!'

"""I felt dissatisfied and disappointed""",4.0,G Alexander,2016-07-31,"✅ Verified Review |  Flew Sydney to Amsterdam, returning from Paris to Sydney, both via Singapore in July. I had researched Premium Economy with SIA. The flight on A380 tended to be more comfortable with more room. Boarding in Sydney was chaotic and confusing. The A350 seat to Amsterdam was very uncomfortable (front row) and the foot rest was redundant - I am 188 cm tall and this seat is not designed for my build by any means. Service was generally good but not up to the marketing hype. Only offered champagne once on each leg despite the way it is marketed and if I wanted more if was begrudgingly offered. Food (Book the Cook) was okay. Considering cost and advertising this as a premium cabin, there was no sense of privacy or a little bit more exclusivity because rarely, if ever, were dividing curtains or wall dividers closed. This was more for the convenience of FA who were moving between Premium and Economy with food trolleys, etc. Many Economy pax took the opportunity to wander through cabin, especially when nursing crying babies. Also, noise, especially many screaming babies were immediately behind my rear row seat in A380 flights - very noisy (even with noise cancelling headphones). Certainly there was more room and a little more comfort but at what cost - I don't feel it was anywhere near value for money. My biggest concern and complaint, which I made to FA, and even to SIA customer service, on CDG to SIN flight (July 15), was when parents left their two boys in Premium Economy while they took themselves off to Business class. They did check a few times but basically the two boys were left to their own devices. I had to stop them from damaging the lights, the window shutters, clambering over their seats, especially the young boy of 4-5 years. The FA cannot be expected to keep an eye on two young boys and neither should passengers. In this day and age, this is a big concern. Anything could have happened to the boys. What if there was an emergency - who would look after them? They became very restless and eventually I complained to FA but nothing was done. The parents were inconsiderate, selfish and irresponsible. Singapore Airlines were disrespectful of other paying pax. As a passenger, why should anyone's flight be disrupted and stressful due to others' selfishness as in this case? This is not about whatever class your in; airlines must stop parents from abandoning their children like this for everyone's sake. Also, if anything happened to the children, who is liable - the other passengers? the airline? Would I fly SIA Premium Economy again - I seriously doubt it. It has potential but if they don't deliver on their marketing promises, I will fly other airlines who do. Also it is disappointing that they cannot even respond to a written complaint. If you over-promise and under deliver consistently, you have dissatisfied customers.

I flew with Singapore Airlines from Singapore to Melbourne (29/07/2016) in Premium Economy as part of a return trip to Colombo. This was my first time flying Premium Economy with Singapore Airlines, though I have flown it before with another large Asian carrier (which was a good experience). I usually fly economy with my partner for holidays and business class for work trips, so have some sense of the competition and product on offer. I'm also tall (194cm) and fairly broad which can make fitting into standard economy seats a squeeze. I had read a few reviews before the flight (all positive) about the new Premium Economy offering from Singapore Airlines and was interested to see for myself. The boarding at Changi was surprisingly disorganised and something of a circus. There was also some delays with take off which appeared to put the staff into such a fluster they forgot to give us menus or the standard amenity pack. The seats in Premium Economy look modern and fancy but are surprisingly uncomfortable for tall people. While they provide a bit more leg room and recline it is hard to make much use of this in a comfortable manner, and forget about getting much sleep. The foot rest offers nothing other than an annoyance and a reduction of leg room. The staff were (on the positive side) not rude but generally unhelpful, unfriendly, looked bored and appeared to go out of their way to not offer anything that might be perceived as an extra (eg. another glass of wine, a second cup of coffee, authentic hospitality etc). The main meal was very small and surprisingly un-tasty. The snack before landing was meant to be chicken fried rice but I struggled within the minuscule dish to find anything other than white rice and a couple of bits of carrot. The meals were so small and mean I was starving by the end of the 7.5 hour flight. The wine/champagne (if you're very lucky you can get one glass) they serve in a plastic tumbler (unlike the ad). The staff also have a habit of leaving you locked in with your empty meal tray for about an hour, which I can only imagine is a crowd control exercise. The entertainment system was good with a reasonable range of titles though annoying compulsory ads at the start of each viewing. It has an bad habit of switching itself on while you are trying to sleep as the controls are right where your knee pushes into the side of the seat. Overall, Singapore PE appeared to me to be a very average Economy with a slightly fancier looking seat, though not one that is well designed or practical for taller people. The service is anything but premium, in fact I've had better service in standard economy for a whole lot less dollars.

I don't think it's fair that they charge premium price for such an aged regional bird. Despite the trademark efficient, if not cold, SQ style service and tasty in-flight catering, very little can justify premium SQ pricing. The recliners are not a big issue on the short 3.5 hour flight and can actually be quite comfortable for a quick snooze after the meal service, but the screen is prone to glare, and my wife's screen was just malfunctioning the whole trip, making her experience not much different from a recent J class experience on a shorter MNL-HKG trip on PR with no IFE save for borrowed iPads. There wasn't the standard stowage space you'd expect from more modern J class products, but the toilets were clean and the amenities plentiful. So disappointed on this leg. Onward journey from SIN to DPS on a more modern A330 with angled-lie flat seats and a 15 inch seatback IFE AVOD system. Better product with more stowage areas. Service was half a degree warmer than the crew's from the MNL leg, but still a bit robotic for me. Got the nasi lemak via Book the Cook for breakfast and was quite a tasty offering.

"""not as good as I expected""",6.0,Ron Cruickshank,2016-07-17,"✅ Verified Review |  London to Melbourne via Singapore. In general, the boarding process and on-board service was very good, with most flight attendants being amiable and chatty. The food was good too, apart from a very ordinary entree leaving London. However, both flights were marred by very noisy children. On the first sector (on the very quiet A380) I was in the front cabin which offers a more intimate setting. A small baby cried almost all of the trip despite attempts by his parents to pacify him. So a decent sleep was impossible. Even the supplied noise-cancelling headsets could not eliminate all of the noise, and anyway they produced a constant repetitive buzzing noise. I fully support family travel and do feel for parents who have to deal with distressed children but surely SIA could arrange for a quiet area for travellers. The sector to Melbourne was worse. I was seated in the front row of the small front cabin - with 2 rows of seats and no bassinet places. Behind me was a family of 5 with a girly toddler who screamed for most of the flight. A baby crying I can understand, but this family was generally very noisy and seemed unaware that they were sharing the cabin with other passengers. There seemed to be no attempt by cabin staff to try to improve the situation, even though their exchanged looks indicated that they were aware of the noise. Added to that, the cabins of the un-upgraded B777-300ER's are becoming quite shabby and worn, and the IFE systems are behind the times. Because of the noisy fellow travellers I have to downgrade my ratings for these flights. It is a pity, because SIA are reliable, honour seat allocations and the staff are generally very good.

Yes, the seats are massively wide and the leather is lovely but it all feels a little, old in comparison to what's on offer with the Middle Eastern carriers. No turn down service (flight left Melbourne at 1835hrs) though a nice warm doona provided. The seat only has a thin foam pad as an underlay when turned down. Meals were served when they determined, not you. I say ""meals"" though for some reason there was nothing offered coming into Singapore although the menu showed a snack available. I used ""book the cook"" and the fish was sublime but the remainder of the meal was nothing too exciting. There is no toiletry bag though SQ pride themselves on having hand creams and lotions etc in the toilets. Which is fine but we all love a take away from a flight, surely we should be given a choice? Also, no pj's! These days it's just expected. The Silver Kris inflight was pretty poor, limited number of first run (decent) movies, I ended up watching some videos on my iPad.

Food served promptly with drinks offered and juice or water brought around during the flight. Landed in Singapore on time and spent the transit in SQ 1st Class lounge due to Virgin Australia FF Status. Flight to Paris left at 10 past midnight and boarding was a little chaotic with no-one really taking notice of which lane they were supposed to be in. Seated in 33 H and K for the long flight to Paris and noticeably less leg-room than the front row. Cabin was only half-full so some people moved to vacant rows, however due to seat design they couldn't really stretch out. Which comes to my only complaint which is the design of the seats. They would possibly rank as the most uncomfortable airline seats I have ever sat in. They are too short in the squab (where you sit) and the leg rest is almost useless. I would hazard a guess that some seats in economy are more comfortable. Overall if you have only ever flown economy you would probably appreciate the slightly extra leg room and the bigger screens but overall I would save up and fly business class.

"""treat passengers quite well""",8.0,Richard Marks,2016-05-20,"✅ Verified Review | Tokyo Narita to Los Angeles with Singapore Airlines (SQ12). A380 on the upper level Business Class section. Service on Singapore Airlines is top notch, staff are very friendly and professional and treat passengers quite well. Food and drinks selections are excellent with a wide range of choices available. Having flown on several A380's primarily those operated by Singapore Airlines, I have found that this one offers some of the older seating which I am not terribly fond of. My problem with the seats is that the foot rest shelf is offset and does not allow for one to site with their legs straight ahead, instead you have to angle your legs slightly which is uncomfortable. Also on these older planes, the electrical controls for the seats are showing their age and heavy use by being slow to respond or not respond at all. For converting your seat into a bed, there is unfortunately no information provided and either requires you to spend a great deal of time figuring it out or waiting for an attendant to help you (or watch them while they help someone else). Basically the latch to release the seat back is located on the upper outer edge towards the aisle, but is well concealed so not easy to find even by touch. You must also make sure that the seat is in the full upright position before trying to convert it to a bed. Another problem that I have encountered is that the temperature in the cabins is usually on the warm side which makes it difficult to sleep well. With regards to inflight WiFi, it would be nice if this was included for Business Class and Suites passengers considering the cost of tickets on Singapore Airlines.

Between Sydney and Singapore I was in 35A and 31A to Tokyo, the same on the return. There is no overhead locker space for 35A as the partition wall blocks the cabin bins, while 31A has a single storage pocket on the bulkhead, stuffed with magazines etc, rather than the double pockets on the seat backs. I utilised the Book-The-Cook service on all legs, which were nice meals but nothing to really to separate them from regular inflight meals in terms of presentation. The seats were nice and comfortable with excellent width, recline and nice leg rest. The big bonus was the generous 13.3"" screen size which was clear and wonderful for watching the IFE. However the high wall mounted screens in row 31 meant that any movie I watched or personal photographs I wanted to view, they would be on view to the whole cabin. Whilst seated in 35A, I could clearly watch what was on the screen of the person in 31K for example. The staff were super attentive as they always are on an SQ flight. The only hassle was the Auxiliary Power Unit failing on the SYD-SIN leg which meant that there was no AC boarding the flight and a prolonged wait to depart the the flight at Changi Airport.

"""no longer a top tier airline""",2.0,Carmen Russo,2016-04-16,"✅ Verified Review |  Sydney to Milan via Singapore with Singapore Airlines. A waste of money! Check-in took almost an hour. This was partly my fault as I was over the baggage allowance, although this had never been a problem with other airlines. The explanation was that SQ is strict with their baggage allowances - fair enough. However the amount of time it took was unacceptable.

The breakfast served just before landing in Milan was awful - two rubbery and cold poached eggs. There is no business class amenity kit provided - how cheap can an airline get? It just smacks of miserliness. I sent a formal complaint to Singapore Airlines and their lukewarm reponse was to say sorry. It is simply not good enough.

With a 1x2x1 configuration, each seat is absurdly wide, which does not make for comfort - with only one armrest usable, the other side requires a pile of cushions as a substitute. The beds do not flatten electronically, and need folding down by hand, a rather cumbersome procedure. When flat the bed is not particularly comfortable, with a small off-set ""cubby hole"" for one's feet. Furthermore, the overall feel of the cabin was pretty tired; I don't know how old this particular aircraft was, but Singapore Airlines started flying A380's in 2007, and this one was showing its age.

Two minor differences: no more headphones but airphones and no drinking glasses on the meal tray but plastic cups. In fact I like the airphones which suppress the airplane noise a bit more. Plastic cups not really an issue but I prefer glass. More importantly: they still serve the cotton hot towels which is a real pleasure. Legroom was decent and the meals were delicious and nice presented. Service on the Amsterdam-Singapore leg and vice versa was of a very high level and consistent. I really appreciate the hard working cabin crew, nothing is too much trouble to ask for. When you push the service button an attendant comes to you generally within twenty seconds. What really surprises me is that they do not forget anything. When I asked for an extra bread or drink during the busy meal services they always came back to satisfy me. I have done this quite a few times and was never disappointed. Very different from my experience with other airlines. Unfortunately the cabin crew on the Singapore-Perth leg and vice versa were a little less attentive. Still good but not exceptional.

Also Singapore gave no amenity bag and instead gave the standard economy class sock, eye shade and slippers - I've had better amenity kit in economy in Qatar Airways, Vietnam Airlines, BA to name a few. The magazine selection was poor as well with no suitable magazines for men under 35 years like myself. Service was tip top with attention on tap and lots of pleasing to my requests for their fine TWG tea selection.

Singapore Airlines have obviously spent a lot of money installing leather seats but they have seriously overlooked the comfort factor. If you're travelling with a loved one the new 'pods' do not permit easy communication. Secondly, you have to make the seat into a bed yourself. This approach is just not good enough. For example, on Air New Zealand the crew ask you when you'd like to lie down and make your bed up for you. The service was just average.

"""disappointing set of experiences""",5.0,C Gibson,2015-12-08,"Perth to Tokyo Narita via Singapore. Having flown SQ fairly regularly over the past 20 years it is interesting to see a decline in economy class, most particularly its lack of crew consistency. SQ used to be my favourite for its crew consistency in service and courtesy. Sadly, I notice it declining every year the past five or so. Check-in at Perth by snobbish and cold DNata staff quite a difference from past experiences. Perth to SIN was not bad on the older 777-200, not completely full so had a spare seat between myself and the window passenger. Legroom was good on these older jets, with an older entertainment system, which I tend not to use that much. The food was fairly dire for economy and portion sizes terribly small compared to the past. Why is the choice always a bland beef or fish (even when labelled the 'Asian' dish)? Singapore is a nation with a rich culinary tradition, but the meals were invariably bland and uninteresting on all four flights. Choosing the Hindu non-veg meals on the return journey to was more a fraction more spice, but again miniscule portions. But worse was the robotic and occasionally sullen crew. Not once on the PER-SIN did I see the inflight supervisor smile the many times he was in economy class. Just haughty and stiff. Upon disembarking, he couldn't even raise a smile for the economy class passengers. Apart from two very junior staff (about 1-2 months on the job, I asked them), who were pleasant and helpful and actually bothered to make eye contact, the rest of the crew I saw in economy were none of that. Mainly robotic, courteous but practically no eye contact and a cold efficiency. TYO-SIN was a dreadful red-eye special at the rear of a packed Boeing 777-300ER. A noisier plane more claustrophobic feeling large jet I have not encountered down the back. It was unpleasant for a nearly 7 hours in darkness. The leg room is just passable. The entertainment system was the only saving grace for those who enjoy it late at night. Food again was ordinary and bland and small portions. Drink service was stingy. I became visibly ill during the flight and whilst crew members saw me using a sick back and using the toilets repeatedly, did not once ask if I needed anything. Mostly the crew sat down at the back around the galleys gossiping in the interval between meal services. They worked fairly hard during service, but there was no warmth for passengers. On both flights, the time taken to clear the meal trays is now long, nearly one and a half hours on both flights. Unconscionable on a past-midnight flight when the majority of passengers generally wish to sleep.

The food was superb, and the service was sensitive and quick. The staff were always on hand to assist my mother. There was only one glitch.

"""service is generally really good""",6.0,Tanmay Bhakta,2015-10-21,"Sydney to Bangalore via Singapore. I have been flying with Singapore Airlines for the last 10 years, and overall the service is generally really good. But on my most recent flight, I was surprised to see that the service seems to have taken a bit of a downturn. Check in and Boarding at Sydney was uneventful. But once we boarded the plane, I realized that me and my mother were sitting in a window bassinet seat with the third seat being occupied by an elderly woman with a four month old. The baby in the third seat started crying during takeoff, and it was like that for half of the flight. Also, despite the fact that this plane was only a year old, the seats were already a bit weathered which made you squirm a bit to find a comfortable position. But the food and in flight entertainment was excellent. But even though the selection of movies are good, SQ has stopped giving economy class passengers the adjustable headphones and now gives the iPod style ear phones which are bit painful to wear, and because of that, we had our ears blocked even after we touched down in Singapore. The Singapore to Bangalore leg was much more peaceful since we didn't have a baby next to us, the food was still good but the quantity was less, the entertainment system also wasn't as reactive as on the first flight.",A380 / Boeing 777-200LR,Family Leisure,Economy Class,SYD to BLR via SYD,2015-09-01,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3,yes,SYD,BLR ,singapore airlines

"""whole experience great""",9.0,Alan Tang,2015-10-11,"Amsterdam to Singapore. I'd have to say the whole experience was great from check-in to service aboard. Check-in was relatively easy as I checked-in online and went straight ahead to internet check-in counter in Amsterdam Schiphol Airport. My baggage was more than allowance (32Kg instead of 30Kg) and the ground staff told me that I won't be charged. Service aboard was also excellent, luckily they have upgraded the aircraft to B777-300ER which is not new but offers better inflight entertainment system and seat features. The cabin crew were present and happy to assist passengers during the flight. There were three meals offered on SQ323, however I found that the meal has been reduced since last time I flew with them on the same route. No cake offered but changed to ice cream. In between snacks were available either offered directly by the crew or set in the galley. Selection of cocktail and mocktail are also offered on economy class. Singapore to Jakarta a short flight about 1 hour and 20 minutes. Cabin crew were pretty in rush to offer the meals, yet still professional.

"""TV is so near to the seat""",6.0,Azri Azmi,2015-10-06,I flew Singapore Airlines Boeing 777 from Singapore to London. The new seat for business class on this Boeing 777 is quite uncomfortable in that the TV is so near to the seat and my head. I got headache watching it for too long. The TV position at the side of my face makes its quite hard for me to look at the TV.  Malaysia Airlines business class seat seat is 2x2x2 layout but it is easier to view the TV. Qatar Airways seat arrangement is similar to Singapore Airlines layout of 1-2-1 but but it is more comfortable to watch the TV as it well positioned in front of your leg and equip with advance IFE systems.

Plus at breakfast they left me alone for ages, because they forgot my meusli. They were nice, but their service rhythm was way off. Worst of all was that seat. I was in 11K, which meant I was bulkhead, with a seat behind me. The guy in it kept moving about kicking his legs out all the time.

I like the leather covering around most of these seats which adds a touch of class. Very good lunch service and a decent refreshment on the way into Singapore. This is the first time I have seen the flip down flatbed and I prefer this configuration because at least the seat has a comforter and is reasonably soft - flew Cathay recently and found the seat too hard to sleep. The angled sleeping is really a non-issue for me. Singapore to London Heathrow on the new business class. This is slightly better but I did not see a major upgrade - looks a bit more modern with a bigger screen. Same flip down configuration that worked about the same.

I decided to travel on their new premium economy flight. The first leg Sydney to Singapore a A380 premium economy and the next leg on a Silk Air Boeing 737-800 which I won't be reviewing here. There is a separate line for boarding premium economy which is good. The seats were 2-4-2 vs 3-4-3 on economy. There are altogether around 6 or 7 rows with a maximum of 48 or 56 in the section. The seats are wider with more leg room and a retractable thigh rest. I did not use this feature much. It has got a bigger seat which is more comfortable. It is not a flat bed similar to business class. The food was good and I know you can order certain special chef prepared meals before boarding on the website. Champagne is available along with wine etc. The entertainment system is a larger screen which I think is either 11 or 13 inch and there are noise cancelling larger headphones available as standard.

Singapore Airlines customer review,5.0,R Young,2015-08-23,"Lounge in Brisbane had been ""refreshed"" since my last visit and looked more pleasant. Had booked a centre seat on 777 as travelling alone and had checked in on line but reallocated to an aisle next to another passenger at the window. It is difficult for a fellow passenger to get to the aisle without disturbing you if you are asleep. Cabin was full so could not move. My personal preference if for a herringbone layout when traveling alone. Crew on the leg Brisbane to Singapore were somewhat helpful and friendly, less so on the leg to Delhi but both were OK. I asked for a water on board when in the air after having left Brisbane but was told by the crew member that they were going to a ""briefing"" and I would need to wait. It arrived 20 minutes later. Sleeping on both legs was a bit challenging given that the beds are not flat and you do get used to them being so on other carriers. On the 777 the passenger beside me woke me twice trying to get to the bathroom. Asking for help with the A380 bed was met an explanation of how to do and that it was easy rather that actual help and I had to go back to ask again. Entertainment OK but had to rewind to get to the start of the movie and it ""dropped out"" twice on the 777. Sadly, food was not great, my special meal is almost always the same on SG and was overcooked this time. Coffee was good. Wine selection looked good and had a Tattinger and a Chablis with both being very enjoyable. No bubbly offered pre take off on either flight. A380 cabin a bit scuffed around my seat but otherwise interiors were fine. On time arrival and departures.

Singapore Airlines customer review,5.0,R Young,2015-08-23,"Chennai has no Business Class line through security so it was a long process, the benefit of this being that once you see the Air India Maharajah Lounge that you don't have long for the flight.

Furniture was in disrepair, there was a bar that didn't appear to have been used for some time, sitting next to a disconnected fridge, no alcohol, food that looked inedible and was hardly warm and stained bulky furniture in the main room (this was full). Boarding was fast and efficient, the first leg meal was a salad of tomato, lettuce, cucumber and carrot with no dressing, butter but no bread and chopped chicken in tomato sauce that was dry and uninspiring. The dessert was melon and was the only thing I ate and went to sleep. The Brisbane sector was better in terms of food but still not great and the first meal I was served I have had four times this year (turkey breast which if you order GF you can also get for breakfast) but the crew on both flights was friendly and responsive.

Singapore Airlines customer review,1.0,David Tzimenakis,2015-08-04,"After 10-15 years of flying Singapore, I think I'll finally stop now. Over the last 2-3 years the service quality has become dire. Plane age and upkeep seems to be getting worse, with cabins uncared for. My biggest ire is the decrease in service for economy, or overworking the premium seats. Both in London, Singapore, and Auckland I've seen that they now have 3-4 check in desks for business, with no customers, yet only 1 for economy, with an hour long queue. The last flight (SIN-ATH), an argument broke out between staff and customers while boarding, as the staff tried to push past boarding economy customers to serve juice to the business passengers. I may not pay quadruple price to sit in business, but I am still a paying customer. Sorry Singapore, you've tried to compete with the UAE for business passengers, and alienated the rest in the meantime.",Boeing 777-300,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,AKL to ATH via SIN,2015-07-01,3.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1,no,AKL,ATH ,singapore airlines

The 2 hour delay prior to take off was a long wait, but the captain apologised continuously and instructed the crew to continuously pour drinks, even the inflight entertainment system was on throughout. Flight was smooth, captain occasionally made an announcement to update passengers on the flight status.

Singapore Airlines customer review,10.0,Ian Chow,2015-07-13,"Once again, SQ went above and beyond in delivering the highest standard of service a customer can expect. Upon boarding and realising the aircraft is only half-filled, the crew offered my family and I each a row so that we would have a more comfortable flight. Before take off, the crew even engaged in small talk with the passengers, informing us of what we can expect upon arriving in Maldives and some of the activities we could join. During the flight, the crew walks frequently to check on passengers but are never intrusive. Drinks were served throughout the flight (without passengers asking for them). Furthermore, honeymoon cakes were given for couples visiting the Maldives for their honeymoon.",Boeing 777,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Male,2015-06-01,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5,yes,Singapore,Male,singapore airlines

Singapore Airlines customer review,2.0,Roger Morris,2015-07-07,"As a business class traveller, I find an arrogant and unhelpful attitude among staff, especially in airports, and mediocre inflight service.

Singapore Airlines customer review,9.0,Jeremy Chan,2015-06-30,"A memorable experience on A380-800 with Singapore Airlines. SQ861 on 27/6, delayed by around half an hour, but flight crew handled the flight efficiently. Window seat on the A380-800 was slightly wider, more comfortable than other ordinary seats. Cabin crew provided highly professional service throughout the journey and had frequent cabin presence. An incredible range of inflight movies including Asian and international films, with fairly large screens. Inflight meal was above average, though not impressive. Cabin temperature was too cold and more than half of the passengers had put their blankets on. In general, considering the high level of service quality offered, this flight had a good value for money.",A380-800,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Hong Kong,2015-06-01,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,4,yes,Singapore,Hong Kong,singapore airlines

Singapore Airlines customer review,5.0,R Navarrete,2015-06-22,"Manila to Paris via Singapore return. The A330s on MNL-SIN-MNL are new, with comfortable seats and a little more legroom, compared to A380s on SIN-CDG-SIN. In the A380s, seats are cramped. Except for the idea of flying in an unusually large aircraft, I did not feel anything special during the trip. In the economy section of the A380 there are only 2 toilets given the number of passengers in each section of the aircraft. The toilet I used for the flight CDG-SIN had a clogged wash basin! Food service nothing remarkable, rolls  are very ordinary. The only thing that perked up these meals were the ice cream bars served as dessert. Check in service in Manila for the outbound flights to Paris was good - efficient and courteous. It was the opposite in Paris for the return. The check in staff was rude. The same thing with the security staff who man the line of passengers reporting for check in. They ""manage"" this long line by cutting it up into two and bringing later-arriving passengers to a separate line that, in effect, let's them jump unjustly over passengers who came earlier. This is an irksome experience from an airline that prides itself in being the best. A strong point though on my flights was the inflight entertainment, Krisworld, which offers countless choices. Overall flight experience was average.",A330 and A380,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,MNL to CDG via SIN,2015-03-01,2.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,4,yes,MNL,CDG ,singapore airlines

Despite the aircrafts being one of their older ones in their fleet, it was well maintained and IFE worked perfectly. Their ground service was also really good - I was 10kg over my check-in baggage limit but SQ was kind enough to waiver 5kg of that so I only had to pay the excess for 5kg.

Singapore Airlines customer review,7.0,M Abbott,2015-06-18,"Flew SIN - JNB on business, and in business class on SQ. Service to their usual high standard. Food out of SIN was very nice, food out of JNB was very average, but I assume that is dependant on what the local ground handlers can provide. Cabin clean enough and well maintained. SQ's lie flat seats - you either like them or you don't. I am in the latter category. Not supportive enough when seated, and too hard and with an odd angled lying position when flat. But this is old news and newer cabins are on their way. Main complaint was that this B777-200ER was a bit tired in terms of ICE (smallish screens with limited movie collection) and WIFI (there wasn't any!). The latter was a particular bugbear for me as the return flight was daytime, I planned to get some work done, but couldn't due to no WIFI connection. This isn't really good enough these days and SQ need to upgrade their fleet in that respect PDQ!",B777-200ER,Business,Business Class,Singapore to Johannesburg,2015-06-01,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3,yes,Singapore,Johannesburg,singapore airlines
